Any suggestions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Att.\n&gt; Elverton.\n&gt;\n&gt; =&gt; The original message:\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  Hello Gordon,\n&gt;\n&gt;  My name is Elverton. I&#39;m doing a research in a metric to estimate the numbers\n&gt; of URL of a domain. I have a problem to solve and you think you can help me.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I want to make a complete graph of all URL&#39;s collected but all I have from\n&gt; crawl.log is the &quot;father&quot; of the URL and the URL. This would be necessary but\n&gt; I have an misundertanding about one thing: If heritrix collect one URL,\n&gt; suppose &quot;yahoo.com&quot; from &quot;google.com&quot;. If the heritrix enter in &quot;amazon.com&quot;\n&gt; and found &quot;yahoo.com&quot; again, in crawl.log will appear:\n&gt;\n&gt;  - - - yahoo.com - google.com\n&gt;  - - - yahoo.com - amazon.com\n&gt;\n&gt;  or only:\n&gt;\n&gt;  - - - yahoo.com - google.com\n&gt;\n&gt;  So, the heritrix will ignore the found in &quot;amazon.com&quot; because it was already\n&gt; found in &quot;google.com&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Att.\n&gt;  Elverton.\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; =&gt; Gordon&#39;s answer:\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; You&#39;re correct, the crawl.log is not enough info to make a full web\n&gt; graph... it only records the exact paths that led to a URI being first\n&gt; discovered. You&#39;d need to log more from the crawler before it &#39;uniques&#39;\n&gt; the URIs for crawling purposes, or perform a post-crawl analysis on the\n&gt; full link-containing content, to create the web graph.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
