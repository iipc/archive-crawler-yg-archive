I filed \nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1591. Feel free to add \nyourself as a watcher on that issue if you like. A couple of notes I put \nin the jira issue:\n\n- One complication is that there&#39;s a whole tree of dependencies and it \nmight be unreasonable to try to include every branch/leaf of the tree.\n- Currently we only have a maven2 repository, so it would be extra work \nto cover heritrix 1.x.\n\nNoah\n\nstevenkhanderson wrote:\n&gt; Noah,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks -- that worked.  I think I had the wrong qdox-current.jar before.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since your message, I tried from scratch, and apparently the old \n&gt; maven doesn&#39;t understand redirects (301 HTTP response),\n&gt; which some apache locations are now responding --\n&gt; so good thing I saved the old .maven directory!\n&gt; Maven&#39;s great when it works, but maybe there needs to be a way\n&gt; to keep a local repository that you can make available with your\n&gt; own product, so no one pulls the rug out from under everyone...\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
