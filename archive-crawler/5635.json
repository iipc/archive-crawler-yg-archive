For example, I want to crawl sites that have\ndropdown boxes and submit buttons. I&#39;d like to iterate the combinations\nin the dropdown boxes (by parsing and extracting them from the HTML on \nthe page) and then POST the results back to the site, retrieving yet\nanother page.\n\nIs that something that could be done by extending Heritrix some way?\nOr does it already support this type of crawling?\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n      \n\n"}}
