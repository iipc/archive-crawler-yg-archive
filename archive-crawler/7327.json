I am working on it now. I&#39;ll admit I wi=\r\nsh I knew scala better--I&#39;ve heard good things about it.\n\nBased on my curre=\r\nnt read of your attachment, the code only parses the payload (is this the p=\r\nroper term?) for ARC files. I can&#39;t seem to find where the &#39;file&#39; is proces=\r\nsed for WARC files (i.e. heritrix 3.1.x).\n\nDoes that sound right to you? \nT=\r\nhanks,\n\nSean\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Erik Hetzner &lt;erik.h=\r\netzner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; At Wed, 21 Sep 2011 18:12:08 +0000,\n&gt; seanoc5 wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt; &gt; I am just starting with Heritrix 3.1 snapshot.
