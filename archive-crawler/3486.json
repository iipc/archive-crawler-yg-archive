I&#39;ll theorize the correct behavior, if you =\r\nhave no\ncredentials for a form, is not to follow, rather than \nattempt to f=\r\nollow links, that don&#39;t work.\n\nWhile they can put code in robots.txt to pre=\r\nvent it,\nit is probably best internet citizen behavior to do\nnothing if you=\r\n have no content to fill in the form.\n\nFollowing is the most cogent of said=\r\n complaints, and I\nagree with her.

It\nseems that you=E2=80=99re mining the javascript on this pag=\r\ne \n\nhttp://www.ockomen.com/site/apps/ka/mt/createCard.asp?c=3DmlI4IhNYJwE&b=\r\n=3D1504365\n\n \nfor links and then sending a GET request for them. However, m=\r\nany of\nthe links you picked are specified in javascript of the form\n\ndocume=\r\nnt.cardForm.action =3D &lt;link here&gt;\n\nIf you look at the Form tag that we=E2=\r\n=80=99re setting the action for, you\nwill see that it has method=3D=E2=80=\r\n=99post=E2=80=99, which means you aren=E2=80=99t going to\nget any useful in=\r\nformation from a GET request. Most of the time\nsending us a GET for a page =\r\nthat requires a POST will just redirect\nyou back where you came from or giv=\r\ne you a screen that says something\nlike =E2=80=9CSorry we can=E2=80=99t dis=\r\nplay what you=E2=80=99re asking for.=E2=80=9D\n\n \nI can put some records in =\r\nrobots.txt to keep you out of these pages,\nbut I thought you might be inter=\r\nested in fixing your code. I haven=E2=80=99t\nseen this error from any other=\r\n bot, and these pages are available in\nall the major search engines, so I b=\r\nelieve most spidering tools do\nhandle this situation correctly.\n\n \n\nCathy A=\r\nrtigues\n\nDirector, Software Development\n\nKintera, Inc.\n\n858-795-3102\n\n\n\n\n"}}
