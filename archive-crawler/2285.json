I&#39;ve extracted the\nar=\r\nc from .gz, now i want to get all my object files from that arc\nfile. I tri=\r\ned some arc extractor namely Arc, nmarch, etc etc..\nWhen i am extracting ar=\r\nc file, it is giving Invalid header error.\n\nBut when i looked up this file =\r\nusing winzip in windows, it was showing\nall text files but there name were =\r\nstarted with a question mark.\n\nI am summarizing my problems as \n\n1. i have =\r\nto send all the retrived files in the text format for\nindexing. so how shou=\r\nld i do it ??????\n\n2. is Heritrix fetching pdf and other format files ?? (w=\r\nhen i saw the\nrecords while running the crawler it was showing some pdf fil=\r\nes in\ncrawl report, but when i am seeing the arc file in winzip, it is only=\r\n\nshowing the text files).\n\n3. Is there anyway so that instead of writing th=\r\ne download file in an\narc format, i can save them in their original format?=\r\n?\n\nI am waiting for your kind help... :-(\n\nThanks in advance...\nShadab..\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
