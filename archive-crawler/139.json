There are a\nfew new features we will want well documented, such as the ability to\nfetch old builds/versions from cvs.  This information is included in the\nbasic readme.txt.\n\nFirstly, there is a strong assumption that compiling release builds builds \nwill only be happening on a single machine.  This is important since this \nis the means of assuring unique build/version numbering and requires a \nfile to keep track of this that should not be in the cvs repository.\n\nBuilding Major/Minor Version Releases:\n\nBuilding a release version (e.g. v1.0) can be done by simply specifying \n&#39;release-version&#39; as the build target when calling ant/startbuild.sh.  The \nversion number will be retrieved from build.properties, so if you would \nlike to increment it do so there.\n\nBuilding new &#39;builds&#39;:\n\nBuilding a &#39;build&#39; can be done by calling ant/startbuild.sh with the \ntarget &#39;release-build&#39;.  This will auto-incriment the (local) build \nnumber, create the cvs label, and create a package exactly as nightlybuild \nwould.\n\nBuilding old versions:\n\nWith this scheme we should be able to build old versions/builds at any \ntime, regardless of the current state of the code.  To do so you should \nuse the target &#39;build-by-tag&#39; and include the tag as an additional \nargument, as in:\n\n  startbuild.sh build.xml build-by-tag b1025\n\nMeta-data:\n\nIn addition to tracking builds within cvs, all builds will now generate a \nmeta-data file called build.metadata that gives useful information about \nhow/where/when the code was built.  This should ease bug reporting and \nalso may provide useful information we can show to user as part of the \nHeritrix user interface (for example reporting version/build information \nso they can include it in bug reports).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions,\n\npt.\n-- \nParker Thompson\nThe Internet Archive\n510.541.0125\n\n\n"}}
