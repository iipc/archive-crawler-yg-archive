It sounds\nlike a necessary feature for the future.\n\nIt would be easier to add an option to not follow all &#39;action&#39;\nlinks, than to make it conditional on &#39;method&#39;, because the\ncurrent parsing, once it is inside an element (like &#39;form&#39;)\nthat might contain URI attributes, looks at each attribute\nindependently. (So making it conditional on &#39;method&#39; would\nrequire a little more running state in just the &#39;form&#39;\nsituation.)\n\n&gt; I just go an email from an angry webmaster that had just recieved 11.000 \n&gt; emails due to this script.\n&gt; \n&gt; The asp-script should not send emails on get-requests - but it does and \n&gt; we&#39;re afraid a lot of scripts out there does that.\n\nWe&#39;ve received or heard of similar problems before, but they&#39;ve\nbeen fairly rare, and have been addressed with a block on all\nURIs of a certain pattern, rather than a method=POST-block.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
