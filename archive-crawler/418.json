Say I\nwant to only crawl a specific Host that I have in my seed list.  I\ntake it I should chose HostScope as my scope of choice.  I did that\nand ran a couple of tests, yet it seems the crawler still goes out of\nthe Host scope to other sites.  Im not sure if it is a link hop issue\nthat I am not understanding or if the host scope just isn&#39;t doing what\nI thought it would.  Thoughts?\n\n~chris\n\n\n"}}
