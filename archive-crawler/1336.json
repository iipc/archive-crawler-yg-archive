I attempted to create a new processor module that would send files\n&gt; over HTTP POST to a server instead of writing them to ARC files.  The\n&gt; module seems to work, but it did not appear in the menus in the web UI.\n&gt;   I attempted to fix this by adding the module to the end of the\n&gt; processors.options file.  When I create a job based on the default\n&gt; profile and add my processor, it works fine.  However, for some reason,\n&gt; when I create a profile that uses my new processor and base a job on\n&gt; it, it drops my processor and the postprocessors (basically, truncating\n&gt; the list of processors where mine should be).  Does anyone know why it\n&gt; would do this?\n\nThis might be a bug in how our profiles work.  What happens if you \ncreate a new job based off a job that successfully included your \nprocessor?  Does it still get dropped?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2.  When running a crawl, the program tends to run out of memory after\n&gt; about 0.25M URIs have been crawled.  I want the program to be able to\n&gt; run large crawls on 0.5 GB of RAM, and the less memory used the better.\n&gt;   Another programmer suggested using database software such as BerkDB\n&gt; (http://www.sleepycat.com/products/je.shtml) \n&gt; &lt;http://www.sleepycat.com/products/je.shtml%29&gt; to act as a sort of\n&gt; virtual memory (storing crawl data on disk instead of in memory).  Is\n&gt; this feasible?  Is there something else I can do to conserve memory on\n&gt; large crawls?\n\nYou&#39;ve seen this release note:  \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/releasenotes.html#1_0_0_limitations?  \nYour memory mileage will vary with the scope you use.\n\nRegards bdb, as of about a week ago, as part of the effort at addressing \nmemory usage, we made Heritrix in CVS HEAD default to use BdbFrontier, a \nversion of the Frontier that keeps its URI queues in a berkeley db \ndatabase.  Memory usage is better overall -- as well as usage of other \nresources such as file handles -- but we still have areas to address \nbefore we can point Heritrix at a broad scope and have it keep within \nmemory bounds.  Try it out.  We&#39;ve been running crawls here in house on \nslow, 512meg machines that can pull down ten times and more what you&#39;re \ngetting using host scopes.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you very much for your assistance.\n&gt; Xavid Pretzer\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
