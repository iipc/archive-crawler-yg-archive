Does=\r\nn&#39;t sound like much,\n&gt; but the numbers get huge, and clog the system.  With=\r\n the frontier\n&gt; off, they fall off the count.  Its fun to watch the count o=\r\nf\n&gt; downloaded + queued drop fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Throughput falls on its face though=\r\n, something to do with not\n&gt; following up on a current web site in the fron=\r\ntier.

We\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncurrent have 8 crawl machines at one time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Under this configura=\r\ntion, the crawl can only be successful if \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crawlers don&#39;t fail. H=\r\nence we&#39;re really focused on how to keep \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crawler running as long=\r\n as possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We thought it might be a good idea to *limit* bdb=\r\n growth after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain size. And we also know that bdb size has a lot =\r\nto do \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the to-be-crawled URL list. Hence the question: Does it m=\r\nake \nsense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to set a upper limit on the Frontier so, when the to-be-\nc=\r\nralwed URL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reached a certain number (say, 120M urls), stop collecting=\r\n to-\nbe-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crawled and throw any new links away? The idea is, in order =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; download 120M URLs, we probably would have a to-be-crawled \nlist o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 400M, and bdb probably won&#39;t survive under that size.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; D=\r\noes it make sense?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cheers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Joe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
