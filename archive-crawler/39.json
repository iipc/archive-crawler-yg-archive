However,\nplease use the module name of &quot;ArchiveOpenCrawler&quot; (instead of\n&quot;Web-crawler&quot;).\n\nThanks!\n\n- Gordon\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: G.B.Reddy\nTo: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Tuesday, April 08, 2003 11:04 AM\nSubject: [archive-crawler] Status !!\n\n\nGordon,\n\nI am presently working on the SEDA socket overhead determination work. I will get the results in the next two days. Some initial\ninsights into it are\n- Oceanstore manages both Tx and Rx in a single stage.\n- It just holds the responses in memory only. It does not write into tmp files if they are huge.\n- TCP response reordering is done by using the seda.sandStorm.lib.aSocket.aSocketInputStream class which reorders packets according\nto the ATcpInPacket sequence number.\n\nThe test that will be done :\n- Port the downloader code ( which we had written earlier during the java nio performance tests ) to SEDA framework and use the\nOceanStore library for HTTP fetching. The same tests that we did for the downloader will be repeated in this oceanstore setup. We\nare removing some oceanstore code to make it similar. The result of this test would tell us the percentage of overhead imposed by\nthe SEDA framework.\n\n\nWe are also done with the JAnt packaging scripts. It uses the present CVS structure itself. I shall create the proposed CVS\nstructure after you approve it. Today we have put the cronjob for testing the web hosting part of nightly builds. We shall enable it\nfor all tomorrow. As of now, only the last nightly build will be available for download. More changes need to be made for hosting\nevery nightly build of a week.\n\nThanks,\nReddy\n\nYahoo!
