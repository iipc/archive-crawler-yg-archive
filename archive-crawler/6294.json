I am interested in disabling some portions of the build \n&gt; process to make incremental development builds complete faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been able to skip the unit tests by using this option:\n&gt;    maven dist -Dmaven.test.skip=true\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I&#39;d also really like to be able to skip the \n&gt; javadoc/docbook/xdoc portions of the build.\n\nThe core team tends to use Eclipse, and thus local launches with new \ncode (and when debugging, sometimes even injecting new code to an \nalready-running JVM) doesn&#39;t require an explicit build.\n\nSupplying the JVM argument &quot;-Dheritrix.development&quot;, on a launch from \nwithin a &#39;heritrix&#39; project checkout root directory, and specifying the \nmain class &quot;org.archive.crawler.Heritrix&quot; is typically all that&#39;s required.\n\n(With the &quot;-Dheritrix.development&quot; argument, the output usually captured \ninto heritrix_out.log will go to the console, and it will find the \nnecessary web-UI and other configuration file from the project &#39;src&#39; \nsubdirectory, instead of usual-build locations.)\n\nSomething similar should be possible in other IDEs or debugging \nenvironments.\n\nIf you still need an abbreviated build for other reasons, you might be \nable to disable various doc-building steps with edits to the project.xml \nor project.properties files.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
