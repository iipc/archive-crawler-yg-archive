I understand Heritrix by default will persue all links it finds (including external ones).\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using Heritrix 2.0.0\n\nIf you&#39;re just starting with Heritrix, we recommend using 1.14.3.\n\nWith the default configuration, crawling will generally stay on the \nsites defined by the seeds, but the crawler will go offsite to get URLs \nthat appear necessary to render on-site pages (such as embedded images, \nscripts, stylesheets, etc.). This behavior comes from the \n&#39;TransclusionDecideRule&#39; -- so removing that rule or setting its various \n&#39;*-hops&#39; limits to zero will prevent the offsite collection.\n\nOn the other hand, if you do want necessary offsite resources, but find \nHeritrix sometimes going too many hops off, you could reduce those \nTransclusionDecideRule &#39;*-hops&#39; values without moving them to zero. \nAlso, Heritrix always considers links found in Javascript or Flash to be \nlike inline/embedded resources (because it can&#39;t tell the difference \nbetween those that load into the page, or only load on user navigation). \nSo if you find the only reason Heritrix is wandering offsite is such \nlinks, you could disable Javascript extraction (in the ExtractorHTML and \nExtractorJS) and Flash extraction (in ExtractorSWF).\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
