I started the checkpoint @ 6:00PM last night.\n&gt; didn&#39;t see bdb-je directory nor the manifest file.\n\nAre you doing &#39;fast checkpointing&#39;?  If not, you might want to consider \nit particularly since you&#39;re crawling big.\n\nAre you saying that under the checkpoint directory, there was no \ndirectory named bdbje-logs that we were filling with the *.jdb bdbje log \ncontent from the job state directory?  In future you might take a \nthreaddump or two to get a clue as to where the crawler is stuck.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I have a bout 30\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; errors like this over the past week on this crawl and eventually\n&gt; I\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; got that Cursor closed error then about 10 OOME after that.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; You think it because of the OOME?  Are they concurrent?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; These are the warnings: After &quot;cursor has been closed&quot; the warnings\n&gt; are all OOME. Before &quot;Cursor has been closed&quot; all warnings are the\n&gt; file reading problem that I mentioned above.\n\nSo the &#39;Cursor has been closed&#39; and the OOMEs (assuming the top listed \nSEVEREs are OOMEs) look to be fairly concurrent.  The &#39;Cursor&#39; SEVERE \nhappens 8 seconds or so before the first OOME (The bulk of the 8 seconds \ncould have been spent in a Full GC stalling the crawler while the JVM \nscrambled to find mem). So I&#39;m guessing the latter is the likely cause \nof the former (Bdbje folks wrote again.  What size bdbje cache are you \nusing?).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; =================================================================\n&gt;            Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:58 GMT           SEVERE           Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://www.embedded.com/showAr...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:49 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI http://www.intaglio-fine-\n&gt; art.c...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:49 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://www.happybabyfeet.com/i...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:49 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://www.globalpin.com/Maced...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:49 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://www.go2fax.com/index.ph...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:48 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/F...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:33 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://poll.imdb.com/http:/www...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:17 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://www.inclineclub.com/boa...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:41:01 GMT        SEVERE        Serious\n&gt; error occured trying to process &#39;CrawlURI\n&gt; http://www.inspirationalphotoi...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:40:45 GMT        SEVERE        Cursor has\n&gt; been closed.(in processor Scheduler)\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 10:40:37 GMT        SEVERE        Problem\n&gt; java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Cursor has been\n&gt; closed....\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 07:55:18 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #15:\n&gt; http://www.incekaralar.com/...\n&gt;          Jan. 10, 2006 06:53:19 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #39:\n&gt; http://giantexplorer.com/re...\n&gt;          Jan. 9, 2006 23:54:24 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #2:\n&gt; http://www.fcnh.com/Global/s...\n&gt;          Jan. 9, 2006 21:23:17 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #35:\n&gt; http://itsolutions.forbes.c...\n&gt;          Jan. 9, 2006 12:47:47 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #3:\n&gt; http://www.gratinglab.com/Co...\n&gt;          Jan. 9, 2006 05:31:28 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #43:\n&gt; http://www.freightlinertruc...\n&gt;          Jan. 9, 2006 05:11:50 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #23:\n&gt; http://www.groundhogstuff.c...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 21:48:05 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #16:\n&gt; http://www.gaslightgifts.co...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 19:43:31 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #20:\n&gt; http://www.graffdurand.com/...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 16:45:35 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #34:\n&gt; http://www.elkcorp.com/beta...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 15:16:29 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #32:\n&gt; http://www.elkcorp.com/beta...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 10:52:36 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #26:\n&gt; http://www.elkcorp.com/home...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 05:43:14 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #30:\n&gt; http://www.gillroys.com/pro...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 04:47:34 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #39:\n&gt; http://www.equinoxfitness.c...\n&gt;          Jan. 8, 2006 02:48:14 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #21:\n&gt; http://www.fox23.com/guides...\n&gt;          Jan. 7, 2006 01:30:43 GMT        SEVERE        Failed get\n&gt; of replay char sequence in ToeThread #50:\n&gt; http://www.gemsforu.com/Pro...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Computer security \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+security&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=BHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWDg&gt; \n&gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+training&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=v0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
