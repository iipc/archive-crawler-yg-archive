As part of this process we are planning on developing a standard\n&gt;test squite, including a collection of pages that represent the types of\n&gt;material the crawler might encounter in the real-world.\n&gt;\n&gt;I see that this page:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://www.searchtools.com/test/\n&gt;\n&gt;is a good start at what we&#39;re shooting for.  Would it be possible for us\n&gt;to use these pages?  Our requirements are that it must be free to us and\n&gt;freely distributable as part of our open source project:\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://sourceforge.net/projects/archive-crawler\n&gt;\n&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;pt.\n&gt;--\n&gt;Parker Thompson\n&gt;The Internet Archive\n&gt;510.541.0125\n\n\n-- \n   Avi Rappoport, Search Engine Consultant &lt;mailto:avirr@...&gt; \n   Complete Guide to Search Engines for Web Sites and Intranets\n             &lt;http://www.searchtools.com&gt;\n\n\n"}}
