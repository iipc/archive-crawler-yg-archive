Basically,\nwhen you&#39;re running a crawl, does a person generally monitor=\r\n it, to\nwatch for it getting stuck on a site (calendars, etc) and make\nadju=\r\nstments, or do you have some kind of app that monitors it and\nnotifies some=\r\none?\n\nI was just running a single site crawl to try some things with\nsettin=\r\ngs and ended up having to add some filtering for it because it\nhad a forum =\r\nmessage board and a calendar that was going to go on and\non.  This kind of =\r\nthing would be hard to anticipate in advance (I\nthink) because sites are go=\r\ning to name pages different, implement\nthings different (php, html, etc.).\n=\r\n\nRob\nAptas, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYahoo!
