For more info on the issue see\n&gt;     http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-670\n&gt; \n&gt;     In general, the first and the last line of crawl.log should do what you\n&gt;     need. The 9th column has 17-digit time stamp that represents beginning\n&gt;     of the fetch time plus the time in milliseconds that took to fetch a\n&gt;     document. These two numbers combined should be the same as the 1st\n&gt;     column date. The first 14 digits of the 9th column&#39;s timestamp\n&gt;     should be\n&gt;     the same as in the metaline of an ARC record. Keep in mind that only\n&gt;     records with positive response codes are written to ARC files.\n&gt; \n&gt;     I hope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt;     i.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;  Hello,\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  I&#39;m looking for the best post-crawl report/log/file from which to\n&gt;     &gt;  extract the crawl begin & end times. I was using the first & last\n&gt;     &gt;  lines of crawl.log for these times but then I noticed that the time\n&gt;     &gt;  for the first ARC record occurs slightly before the date for the first\n&gt;     &gt;  line in the crawl.log. Is there a better place from which to get these\n&gt;     &gt;  dates so that all the ARC record dates will fall within them?\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  thanks,\n&gt;     &gt;  Andrea\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; Yahoo!
