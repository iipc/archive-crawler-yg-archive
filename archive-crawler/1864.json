When I \nfetch the URL then its http response header field contains \n&quot;Content-Location: http://www.debian.org/index.en.html&quot; field. Then \nHeritrix&#39;s &#39;extractHTTP&#39; module extract the latter URL and insert it \ninto crawl frontier, with the same priority as 301(2) referal, though in \nthis case its fetch status is 200. Because &#39;Content-Location&#39; is meant \nto supply the original resource presentation with respect to the request \nURL, following such newly discovered URL doesn&#39;t seem make sense, \nbecause both URLs refer to the same resource exactly. The ideal approach \nto this problem seem to make the two URLs as if they are the same, maybe \nexploiting additional database to store such information.\n      Can you think of a means to avoid downloading the same resource \ntwice  and  at the same time to avoid further duplicated crawling in the \nfuture?\n\n"}}
