The \nFetchHTTP.configureProxy() method would be a place to look to start such \nwork. However, it doesn&#39;t seem like the HostConfiguration class of the \nHttpClient library that we&#39;re using has an fields/accessors for \nproxy-authentication information, so it might be difficult to add.\n\nIf you have sway with the proxy administrators, they might be able to \nallow your crawling machines to use the proxy without an authentication \nchallenge (for example, as a whitelisted IP).\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 5/24/10 12:40 AM, afsungur wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this problem solved, because i have same issue.
