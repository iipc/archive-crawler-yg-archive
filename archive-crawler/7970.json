One thing we didn&#39;t ex=\r\npect was that the filter keeps track of the URIs of the DNS protocol, am I =\r\nright?\n\nSo we were expecting something on the order of 900 million nodes an=\r\nd, after having crawled 400 millions we found out that our frontier, summin=\r\ng up already downloaded and queued ones, contained more than a billion node=\r\ns! So now the false positive probability is falling.\n\nIs there a way to pre=\r\nvent DNS URIs from being stored in the Bloom filter?\n\nThank you very much\nM=\r\natteo\n\n\n"}}
