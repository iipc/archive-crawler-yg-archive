If=\r\n I seem reluctant to leave behind\n&gt; the order.xml format, it is not for a p=\r\narticular love of xml or the\n&gt; order.xml format. It is simply that we have =\r\ninfrastructure deployed\n&gt; that makes use of order.xml.\n\nWould a conversion =\r\ntool of 1.x order.xml/overrides -&gt; sheets help  \nwith your transition?\n\n&gt; A=\r\ndditionally, I have been developing an\n&gt; HTTP interface for Heritrix which =\r\nextends the order.xml format to\n&gt; allow creating jobs, retrieving data, etc=\r\n. from a running Heritrix\n&gt; instance using HTTP (rather than JMX), and I am=\r\n going to have to\n&gt; determine how to rework this to work with the new setti=\r\nngs format. I\n&gt; had not realized until a few days ago that the new settings=\r\n had\n&gt; progressed so far and that order.xml files were to be left behind.\n\n=\r\nNirvana for us would be an HTTPOpenMbeanJMXConnector -- you&#39;d specify  \nope=\r\nration parameters/attribute names in a POST-like payload, and  \nyou&#39;d get b=\r\nack XML or YAML or JSON with the results of the operation/ \nattribute value=\r\n.\n\nThere are projects out there that do this for &quot;standard&quot; MBeans, but  \nn=\r\not for OpenMBeans -- anything more complicated than a primitive  \nvalue or =\r\nString gets serialized and Base64 encoded, which is only  \nuseful if you ha=\r\nve Java code as the client.\n\nBut if an OpenMBeans-aware HTTP connector exis=\r\nted, we would gladly  \nintegrate it into the engine. Then people could more=\r\n easily control  \nHeritrix using widely available scripting languages like =\r\nperl.\n\nI should mention that, unlike in 1.x, in 2.x anything that can happe=\r\nn  \nin the Web UI can also happen over JMX. The Web UI now uses JMX  \nexclu=\r\nsively to communicate with Heritrix.\n\n&gt; Since the order of the lines matter=\r\ns for maps, can you do something to\n&gt; append to a list? For instance:\n&gt;\n&gt; r=\r\noot:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers:_=3Dstring, audio/*;  \n&gt; q=3D=\r\n0.2, audio/basic\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a though, since I generally dislike hard coding t=\r\nhe index of a\n&gt; list.\n\nI really like this idea; would you mind filing a Fea=\r\nture Enhancement  \nin JIRA?\n\n&gt; I had assumed (correctly, I think) that in t=\r\nhe past the names of\n&gt; certain objects determined their primary-ness (for i=\r\nnstance, the\n&gt; object named =91scope=92 was the scope used for the crawl). =\r\nThis seems to\n&gt; make more sense than enforcing a particular name for the se=\r\nttings.\n\nThe new method is good and bad. It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to =\r\n \nhave to manually specify &quot;primary&quot; for a thing like CrawlController  \n-- =\r\nit&#39;s difficult to imagine needing more than one of those.\n\nOn the other han=\r\nd, it&#39;s easy to imagine needing more than BDB  \nenvironment. Assuming you h=\r\nad three separate disk drives, then you  \ncould specify one BDB environment=\r\n for the settings system, one for  \nthe Frontier and one for the crawl hist=\r\nory database. I think it made  \nmore sense to make all the modules behave t=\r\nhe same (if you really  \nwant a second CrawlController -- perhaps some stra=\r\nnge, customized  \nsubclass? -- the settings system won&#39;t stop you).\n\n-Paul\n"}}
