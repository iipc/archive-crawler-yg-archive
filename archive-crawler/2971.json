Sounds like your value of zero for \n&gt; max-trans-hops is stopping prerequisites being crawled (Codes like -63 \n&gt; are defined on end of user manual).\n&gt; \n&gt; You might try moving off the PathScope and instead use preferred \n&gt; DecidingScope.   This scope allows addition of &#39;rules&#39; regards how each \n&gt; URL is evaluated scope-wise.  Gives more fine-grained control.  There \n&gt; are a large set of &#39;rules&#39; to choose from including a &#39;fetch prereqs \n&gt; whatever the rules above me say&#39;.  You can pick up the DecidingScope \n&gt; configured with defaults -- a good place to start -- by selecting \n&gt; &#39;deciding-default&#39; when creating a job based on a profile (Since release \n&gt; of 1.8.0, the deciding-default has become the &#39;default&#39;).\n&gt; \n&gt; Might get you over the above issue -- or create it in a new context.  If \n&gt; the latter, we need to fix it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Frank McCown wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I would like to use a single seed URL of\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.cs.odu.edu/~fmccown/webdev/ \n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://www.cs.odu.edu/%7Efmccown/webdev/&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and have only resources with URLs that match\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://www.cs.odu.edu/~fmccown/webdev/* \n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://www.cs.odu.edu/%7Efmccown/webdev/*&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; be crawled.
