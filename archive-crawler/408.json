It\n  does not currently read CDX files because I have no way of creating\n  one that I can code against. However, once (if) I add this\n  capability then I will not have to scan the archive file to find its\n  members because the relevant information can be read from the CDX.\n\n- You can get an iterator to walk over the contents of the ARC file\n  member by member (or record by record, to use the ARCReader\n  terminology). You can specify a content type to limit the types of\n  members you see: text/*, text/html, image/jpeg, etc.\n\n- You can access the information in the URL record and the response\n  headers from the HTTP server.\n\n- You can access the member&#39;s data in a single call.\n\n- The code currently works on Mac OS X and RedHat Linux 7.3 on x86\n  systems. Before I release I am going to build at least on Fedora\n  Core 1 (I don&#39;t have FC2 installed anywhere), SuSE 64-bit on an\n  Opteron, and SPARC/Solaris using the Sun compilers, and probably\n  Windows under VC++ 7.0 and Cygwin. Suffice it to say the code is\n  portable. It relies on the Zlib library to handle the decompression.\n\nThat should be a suitable feature set to get some use out of\nit. Moving forward I&#39;m planning to add the following:\n\n- Support for the generation of CDX files, using printf-style format\n  strings.\n\n- Support for generating DAT files.\n\n- Support for treating an entire directory of .ARC files as one\n  logical ARC, allowing you to transparently iterate over all\n  elements.\n\n- Support for arbitrary predicates when selecting members with the\n  iterator. For example, you could just iterate over all text/html\n  files that had an HTTP response status code of 200, thereby avoiding\n  the HTML error pages that sites fondly generate now. Or you could\n  iterate over all GIFs (image/gif) and only return those that are\n  animated or are larger or smaller than a given dimension.\n\n- Support for regular expression based filters.\n\n- Support for inserting filters between the data contained in raw\n  response and the data returned by the iterator. For example, you\n  could extract the text from a PDF file.\n\n- Python bindings.\n\n- Support for database integration --- via a class abstraction, with\n  initial support for the native MySQL C API.\n\n- Whatever else people suggest.\n\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
