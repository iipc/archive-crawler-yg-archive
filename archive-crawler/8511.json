Especially:\n   - byte-for-byte identical in request-path?\n   - accept headers?\n   - cookies?\n   - caching headers (esp. if-modified-since or if-none-match)\n\nIt looks like the target URI may be performing an on-the-fly rollup of \nmultiple resources, so despite the &#39;_static&#39; implication of the path, it \nmay have too-clever logic that&#39;s mishandling the crawler request.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 5/7/14, 12:09 PM, Noah Levitt wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Roger,\n&gt;\n&gt; I ran a test crawl of your seed\n&gt; http://birminghamagainstthecuts.wordpress.com/ and it crawled\n&gt; http://s1.wp.com/_static/??/wp-content/mu-plugins/carousel/jetpack-carousel.css,/wp-content/mu-plugins/tiled-gallery/tiled-gallery.css?m=1393501585j\n&gt; without any issues, got a 200 etc... so I don&#39;t know.\n&gt;\n&gt; Noah\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, May 7, 2014 at 1:52 AM, Coram, Roger &lt;Roger.Coram@...\n&gt; &lt;mailto:Roger.Coram@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     There’s a stylesheet on a Wordpress site that Heritrix (3.1.1) is\n&gt;     consistently failing to download:____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;     http://s1.wp.com/_static/??/wp-content/mu-plugins/carousel/jetpack-carousel.css,/wp-content/mu-plugins/tiled-gallery/tiled-gallery.css?m=1393501585j____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;     In every case it returns a 404 and has done for the past couple of\n&gt;     months, despite the fact the URL seems to be perfectly accessible.____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;     I’ve tried recreating Heritrix’s request via curl from the same\n&gt;     server:____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;     curl -0 -v -A &quot;bl.uk_lddc_bot/3.1.1\n&gt;     (+http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/legaldeposit/websites/websites/faqswebmaster/index.html)&quot;\n&gt;     --silent -D -\n&gt;     &quot;http://s1.wp.com/_static/??/wp-content/mu-plugins/carousel/jetpack-carousel.css,/wp-content/mu-plugins/tiled-gallery/tiled-gallery.css?m=1393501585j&quot;\n&gt;     -H &quot;Connection: close&quot; -H &quot;Referer:\n&gt;     http://birminghamagainstthecuts.wordpress.com/&quot; -H &quot;Accept:\n&gt;     text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8&quot; -H\n&gt;     &quot;Host: s1.wp.com &lt;http://s1.wp.com&gt;&quot;____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;     This seems to make the same request but returns a 200.____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;     Any ideas?____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;     Thanks,____\n&gt;\n&gt;     Roger____\n&gt;\n&gt;     __ __\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     ******************************************************************************************************************\n&gt;     Experience the British Library online at www.bl.uk &lt;http://www.bl.uk/&gt;\n&gt;     The British Library’s latest Annual Report and Accounts :\n&gt;     www.bl.uk/aboutus/annrep/index.html\n&gt;     &lt;http://www.bl.uk/aboutus/annrep/index.html&gt;\n&gt;     Help the British Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
