No, that&#39;s not the fellow here, and indeed the \ncodebase for that port doesn&#39;t look like the same one (though they&#39;re \nboth from the Mozilla tree).  Ours is universalchardet \n(http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/universalchardet/) \nversus chardet (http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/intl/chardet/).  I \nwon&#39;t try to guess the distinctions (though it&#39;s clear universalchardet \nis at least *bigger*...)   At any rate, I&#39;ll try to find out what the \nstory is.\n\n&gt; Charset would be useful for sure but I think it comes after the heritrix \n&gt; exploitation of the charset information supplied -- the html meta I&#39;ve \n&gt; going on about.\n\nIt&#39;s not a particular priority for us just yet, either, and I admit I \nhaven&#39;t been paying much attention to where Heritrix is with that topic. \n  It just happened to come up when the fellow offered up his work, so I \nfigured I&#39;d float it.\n\nRegards,\nAndy Boyko   aboy@...\nLibrary of Congress\n\n\n\n"}}
