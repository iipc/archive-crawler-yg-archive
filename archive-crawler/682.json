It might be tricky to\ndefine the the desired behavior for various situations where resources\nare referred-to across site boundaries.\n\nFor example: You might want different behaviors depending on whether\nyour aim is for each ARC to be maximally self-contained (and separable\nfrom others), compared to if you were simply trying to group resources\nby hostnames/administrative domains.\n\nWe are unlikely to implement such options anytime soon, as it does not match\nour typical usage. However, if you wanted to add this capability yourself,\nwe&#39;d be happy to give advice/feedback on your proposal or implementation,\nand if the result is of general use, we&#39;d eagerly integrate it into the\nofficial releases.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
