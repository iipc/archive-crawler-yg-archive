Then \n&gt; \n&gt; the crawler will exclude those files you don&#39;t need before it \n&gt; \n&gt; conducts the pre-fetch-processing. I think it is a quite \n&gt; \n&gt; effecient way to exclude files. It works well in my \n&gt; \n&gt; experiments.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; Yan\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ozimmels&quot; &lt;oz.heritrix@s...\n&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; so - heritrix filters are &quot;filter out&quot; filters.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; what would be the best way to only get links of a certain type.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; given a site : \n&gt; &gt; http://some.domain.com/ as the seed\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i want to crawl only links that match .*reg1.* and .*reg2.* etc ..\n&gt; &gt; what would be the best way to do that ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ( i&#39;ve seen suggestions such as .*(^(reg1)).* \n&gt; &gt; is there a better way.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AND MOST IMPORTANT : \n&gt; &gt; where would be the best place to put this filter and why ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; what are the other options:\n&gt; &gt; additionalScopeFocus ? \n&gt; &gt; Preselector ? \n&gt; &gt; Preprocessor ? \n&gt; &gt; fetch-processors ? \n&gt; &gt; extract-processors ? \n&gt; &gt; write-processors ? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and why ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; where is the best way to place this filter.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
