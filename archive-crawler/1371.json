When I put a URL like this \n&gt; in as a seed, however, the crawler hangs, and the seeds report shows \n&gt; the crawler as using the seed: &#39;smb://name/&#39;, basically truncating it \n&gt; at the colon.  In testing this, I noticed that it does the same thing \n&gt; for http urls that use the same format for username and password.  I&#39;m \n&gt; not sure if this problem is in the UURI class or somewhere else in the \n&gt; Heritrix code.  I&#39;d try escaping the colon, but I believe jCIFS treats \n&gt; escaped colons differently to allow colons to be used in passwords.  \n&gt; Any suggestions?\n&gt; \n&gt; Xavid Pretzer\n\nWe weren&#39;t allowing seeds to have userinfo; we were mangling the\nreading of such seed URIs.  I&#39;ve added a fix to HEAD.\n\nOf note is that while the userinfo is now present in the UURI thats\nbeing passed about in the crawler, you have to go get it explicitly by\ndoing a UURI#getUserinfo.  This may not be sufficent for your smb&#39;ing\n-- but maybe it is.  Let us know \n\n(If you do UURI#toString on a UURI made from an URI that had userinfo,\nthe userinfo won&#39;t be present and currently there is no easy way of\ngetting back the original URI string (The base httpclient URI class\ndoesn&#39;t include userinfo in its #toString rendition of the URI)).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n"}}
