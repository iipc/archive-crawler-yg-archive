So I changed the crawler-beans.xml to make automatically checkpoints:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;!-- CHECKPOINTSERVICE: checkpointing assistance --&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;bean id=&quot;checkpointService&quot;\n&gt;    class=&quot;org.archive.crawler.framework.CheckpointService&quot;&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;property name=&quot;checkpointIntervalMinutes&quot; value=&quot;120&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;!-- &lt;property name=&quot;checkpointsDir&quot; value=&quot;checkpoints&quot;/&gt; --&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;/bean&gt;\n\nThis should be sufficient to enable checkpointing and create automatic \ncheckpoints at the configured interval. (I don&#39;t see anything missing \nhere for initial-setup.)\n\n&gt; Now I have the situation that I had to restart heritrix and want to continue an aborted crawljob. But when building/launching the job an error occurs in the log and I cannot restart the crawl:\n&gt; \n&gt; 2010-01-18T01:37:21.267Z SEVERE IllegalStateException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: File &#39;/opt/heritrix-3.0.0/./jobs/500-DS-100114-2/state/cp00034-20100116174133/jdbfiles.manifest&#39; does not exist (in thread &#39;500-DS-100114-2 launchthread&#39;)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2010-01-18T01:18:44.900Z INFO Job launched\n&gt; \n&gt; 2010-01-18T01:18:34.319Z INFO Job instantiated\n&gt; \n&gt; (in thread &#39;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier@...&#39;)\n\nHow are you specifying the checkpoint to resume? (The two main ways are \n(1) via the drop-down in the web UI, after &#39;build&#39; and before &#39;launch&#39;; \nor (2) via a &#39;Checkpoint&#39; bean inserted to your configuration specifying \nthe checkpoint directory.)\n\n&gt; So, probably I am missing something when configuring the Checkpoint-Service. Any ideas what I have to change?\n\nHave any files been moved between the previous run, and the resumption?\n\nDoes the file \n&#39;/opt/heritrix-3.0.0/./jobs/500-DS-100114-2/state/cp00034-20100116174133/jdbfiles.manifest&#39; \nseem to exist, and/or does its parent directory exist?\n\nIf not, does a &quot;cp00033-&quot; version exist?\n\nIs there any additional info in heritrix_out.log suggesting other errors \neither at the time the checkpoint was written, or the time of \nresumption? (Perhaps the real problem was when the checkpoint was \nwritten, rather than resumed.)\n\nThe Heritrix checkpoint functionality has usually been a bit awkward and \nfragile. The H3 architecture allows checkpoints to occur more rapidly \nthan ever before, and deduplication and recrawl features will in the \nfuture increasingly assume checkpoints are being run, and that resuming \na checkpointed crawl is even more common than restarting. But, for now \nthe automatic handling of files (such as renaming-them-aside in the face \nof resumes) is still crude, and a false-start could potentially foul the \nstate of stored checkpoints.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Tino\n\n\n"}}
