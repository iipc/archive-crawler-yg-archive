You can also \n&#39;checkpoint&#39; a crawl to save its entire state to disk, allowing you to \nquit the program completely. Later, you can launch Heritrix again and \n&#39;resume from checkpoint&#39; to continue from the saved point.\n\nRegarding (2):\n\nHeritrix expects to be configured and monitored via its web interface, \nafter being launched from the command-line. But, most tasks can be \nautomated through command-line operations if necessary ï¿½ in the latest \nH3 versions, typically by synthesizing web requests against the web \ninterface.\n\nTo launch, configure, and monitor Heritrix crawls it helps to have (or \nacquire) some familiarity with how Java applications and code are \nstructured, as tuning its behavior for your system/workload can require \ntinkering with Java options, and configuring optional features usually \nmeans choosing between alternate included code-modules. (You will see \nJava class names mixed in the interface and logs quite often.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\nOn 5/25/11 9:13 AM, dE . wrote:\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt;\n&gt; This&#39;s my first mail in this list.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m completely unfamiliar to Heritrix, I&#39;m looking at it as an\n&gt; alternative to httrack which&#39;s definitely not suited for large projects.\n&gt; Before I start, a few questions --\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) Since I&#39;ll be using Heritrix on Desktop systems, is there a stop and\n&gt; resume feature, i.e. stop, restart and resume from the exact same point\n&gt; where it last got stopped?\n&gt; 2) I&#39;m planning to just configure Heritrix using the webUI and will be\n&gt; running it on the terminals (ttys), is this possible? If my guess is\n&gt; right, Heritrix is capable of running as a daemon which would be ideal\n&gt; for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
