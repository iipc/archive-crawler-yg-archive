OTOH, m=\r\nore options for remote-controlling\nthe \n&gt; crawling &#39;engine&#39; without any Web=\r\n UI at all are available, so it might \n&gt; be an interesting upgrade for you =\r\nfrom any 1.X version.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, if it&#39;s working for you *except* ending f=\r\naster than expected, \n&gt; it&#39;s probably a configuration issue rather than som=\r\nething a new version \n&gt; would fix.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; tgeorgio wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve read some posts on this and I am having a problem where I use the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Java Process and ProcessBuilder classes to launch Heritrix as if it\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n were launched by the command-line...but I get the same issue as:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1272\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ..=\r\n.the crawl ends after only a few crawled files with no obvious\nerror.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The solution to that post was to upgrade to version 1.2.0 or greater\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and use the Heritrix Jar directly...is this the recommended way? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; If I upgrade to the latest (2.0.0) will my Process/ProcessBuilder\n&gt; &gt; met=\r\nhod work?
