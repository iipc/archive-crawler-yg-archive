(Also, nice name...)\n\n&gt; This scratches the surface. For the Tagalog and Vietnamese crawls we\n&gt; seeded using techniques described in your BootCat papers, and we&#39;ve\n&gt; thought about how to integrate BootCat type processes into Heritrix\n&gt; proper, but for now we do it separately using some Java apps \nutilizing\n&gt; the Google API and our language identifier technology.\n\nIndeed, right now, I&#39;m seeding my crawls using the top pages found by\nGoogle for English queries made of two randomly combined words from a\nrandom selection of mid-frequency BNC terms.\n\nOnce I understand more about Heritrix, I would be happy to help out with\nthe project of integrating BootCat-like seeding methods into it.\n\n(Right now, I seem to have out of memory problems, having tried a broad \nscope crawl... still a lot to learn! ;-) )\n\nThanks again!\n\nRegards,\n\nMarco\n\n"}}
