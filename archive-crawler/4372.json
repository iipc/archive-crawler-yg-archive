How can I see the source code of existing writer processor such as\n&gt; ARCWriterProcessor. I tried to open the source code in NETBEANS with\n&gt; heritrix-1.12.1.jar, but I couldn&#39;t find any source code in that file.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe src is not built into the jar.  You need to check out the source \ncode.  The manual is a little out of date but gives you the general \ngist: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual/building.html#N10036.  \nRun &#39;svn checkout \nhttps://archive-crawler.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/archive-crawler/trunk/heritrix&#39; \n(or use the URL \n&#39;https://archive-crawler.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/archive-crawler/branches/heritrix_1_12&#39; \nif you want to get the src of the current release).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. I wonder how I can put my import my class to heritrix. Do I need to\n&gt; make additional jar file, and save it to library file and declare my\n&gt; class in Processor.options? Processor.options is read-only and I can&#39;t\n&gt; modify it.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy the &#39;Hadoop DFS Writer Processor \n&lt;http://www.zvents.com/labs/heritrix_hadoop&gt;&#39;.  Its linked off the \nheritrix home page.  Its a complete writer developed external to the \ncrawler that can be integrated just by dropping a few jars into the \nheritrix lib directory.   It has its own ant build.xml and good \ndocumentation on how to build.\n\nYou can also check out the other writers that are integral to heritrix.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s confusing and would somebody explain it how it works for beginners?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve read development documents but it didn&#39;t help me much.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
