The server-side language \nwith which it was generated or any file-extension visible in the URL is \nirrelevant.\n\nSo, the problem must be in your configuration or code.\n\nNote that getOutlinks() only returns links discovered by the Extractors \nuntil the LinksScoper is applied. The LinksScoper converts all links \nthat pass scope-testing into CrawlURIs, and puts them in the \n&#39;outcandidates&#39; collection, clearing the outlinks collection.\n\nSo maybe your scope is rejecting the link, or you are looking for it too \nlate in processing.\n\nAlso, maybe your test page has some other problem that prevents the \ncontent from being recognized as HTML. (Perhaps a bad Content-Type or \nother header?)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nhappyxinglele wrote:\n&gt; I wrote a simple asp page like this:\n&gt; &lt;html&gt;\n&gt; &lt;head&gt;\n&gt; &lt;title&gt;This is asp testing title&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;meta keywords&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;description seven&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/head&gt;\n&gt; &lt;body&gt;\n&gt; &lt;table&gt;\n&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a \n&gt; href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/testseven/music/feel.mp3&quot;&gt;feel.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td\n&gt;&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/table&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; And when I &quot;getOutlinks()&quot; in my plugin writer, there is nothing in \n&gt; it.
