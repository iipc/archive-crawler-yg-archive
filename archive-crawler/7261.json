My goal is to collect all domain names on the Internet possibly qu=\r\nickly and without doing anything else. What would be the best configuration=\r\n to approach this? \n\nMy current config is: BroadScope, no frontier changes,=\r\n a single Extractor collecting every new domain name it sees to a MySQL DB,=\r\n running with 100 threads and a couple thousand directory style seed sites.=\r\n The problem I am running into is the following:\n\n- first, stuff goes well =\r\nand domains are found at a rate of 100+/second\n- after about 30-40 minutes =\r\nand about 50000 domains collected, the rate of new-found domains slows down=\r\n very much to below 1/second and stays there. the crawl also slows down fro=\r\nm 100+/second to 10 or less per second. no scope or seed changes seem to af=\r\nfect this. even if I take a completely new set of seeds, it only produces a=\r\n couple hundred new domains at best and then similarly dies off into nothin=\r\ngness.\n- this seems strange behavior given that there are 200mil+ domains a=\r\nnd an entirely unrelated set of seeds (I&#39;ve taken only .jp domains, for exa=\r\nmple), should produce at least a similar set of total new domains found. it=\r\n doesn&#39;t, however. at the moment I&#39;m stuck at why this is the case.\n\nAny th=\r\noughts?\n\nThanks,\nSergey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
