(This rules out \neverything but the seeds themselves at that scope step, but then the \nlater TransclusionDecideRule will bring back in those that were \ndiscovered via short embed/inline references.)\n\nIf you want to follow links out one hop, you can set this value to &#39;1&#39;. \nBut, starting with the default configuration, other rules will still be \napplying a limiting scope implied by the seeds. So if you have a seed:\n\nhttp://domain.tld/whatever/page.html\n\n...but not...\n\nhttp://domain.tld/\n\n...then only URIs starting &quot;http://domain.tld/whatever/&quot; (as deduced \nfrom the seed, and represented by the SURT-form \n&quot;http://(tld,domain,)/whatever/&quot;) will pass the earlier scope-rule, and \nthus be eligible for the 1-link-away testing.\n\nIf you want to follow links out one hop to any site, then replace the \nfirst rule with an AcceptDecideRule. This makes the crawl \ndefault-accept, rather than default-reject, leaving it up to later rules \nto stop certain paths. If your &#39;max-hops&#39; is 1, that rule will rule-out \neverything more than one hop away. (And again, some extra things will be \ntranscluded.)\n\nOf course, &#39;max-hops&#39; can also be any other value.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 12/22/11 4:23 AM, westfood@... wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; we are preparing crawling of single pages for collection.
