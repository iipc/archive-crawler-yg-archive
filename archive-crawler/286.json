That means that the &#39;work&#39; directory can be deleted.\n\nThis new change works equally well for dev. environment and our distros. \nOnly remaining\nissue is to include precompiled pages with the distros so that the \n&#39;first time compile&#39; will\nbe taken care of.\n\n- Kris\n\nKristinn Sigur�sson wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;\n&gt; By default all JSP pages are recompiled each time you launch Heritrix.\n&gt; This is of course very annoying. But if you create a directory called\n&gt; &#39;work&#39; in the ..../webapps/admin/WEB-INF/ directory then compiled\n&gt; pages will be stored there and reused between crawls.\n&gt;\n&gt; This works very well running from a dev. environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since our distributions pack the JSP files into a WAR file this does\n&gt; not apply to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hopefully though, our distributions will come with precompiled JSP\n&gt; pages in the very near future.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Kristinn Sigurdsson\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
