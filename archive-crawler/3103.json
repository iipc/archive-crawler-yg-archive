But, the default \nbehavior of LinksScoper already marked any redirect from a seed with \n&#39;isSeed&#39;. Thus the rule doesn&#39;t fire, and the redirect is never \nconsidered in-scope at all.\n\nOne quick fix might be to add a SeedAcceptDecideRule -- always crawl \nanything marked as a seed.\n\nWith that, you may not need the AddRedirectFromRootServerToScope rule at \nall. The behavior of LinksScoper + SeedAcceptDecideRule would be enough \nto get the URI scheduled. (It is later, when the scheduled URI is \nnoticed as a &#39;discovered seed&#39;, that the scope is updated to accept all \nsimilar URIs.)\n\nThat said, the AddRedirectFromRootServerToScope shouldn&#39;t fail when \nLinksScoper has already done part of its job for it. Thanks for finding \nthis, keep the reports coming!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\npandae667 wrote:\n&gt; Hi everyone, \n&gt; \n&gt; I stumbled over yet another problem in my last crawl.\n&gt; \n&gt; The seed in question this time:\n&gt; http://www.einsiedler-forsttechnik.de\n&gt; \n&gt; This URL yields a HTTP 302 response and redirects me to:\n&gt; http://www.forsttechnik-einsiedler.de\n&gt; \n&gt; Now my problem is, that even though I have a AcceptRootRedirects rule\n&gt; in my DecidingScope, this URL isn&#39;t added to the seeds - thus not\n&gt; crawled at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once again I&#39;m asking myself if my expectations are wrong or if\n&gt; heritrix is doing something wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;   Olaf Freyer\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
