Makes sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Heritrix, I can see where attributes could be copied into child\n&gt; &gt; URIs -- in the handleLinkCollection method of the Postselector\n&gt; &gt; class, for example, when the CandidateURI is formed.  So I would l\n&gt; &gt; like to extend Postselector and over-ride just this one method, \n&gt; &gt; but it is private.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How do you all decide which methods to make protected and which\n&gt; &gt; private?  Maybe it would be nice to allow the application\n&gt; &gt; programmer to add attributes to the CandidateURI before it goes \n&gt; &gt; onto the frontier, perhaps by some call-back or by factoring out a\n&gt; &gt; protected and over-ridable method that decorates the CandidateURI.\n&gt; \n&gt; I made the Postselector#schedule method protected so you can\n&gt; override it in HEAD.  Is this sufficent?\n  \n&gt; &gt; D.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
