It is very important that \nall reports are accurate and that they make sense.\n\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around the following observations about the\n&gt; seeds in a crawl I did.\n&gt; \n&gt; - The original seed list has 280 URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; - The seed list after the crawl died (the cause since fixed in HEAD)\n&gt;   has 304 URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; - The WUI seed report contains 300 URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; - If I extract the seeds from the crawl.log (by taking entries with an\n&gt;   empty discovery path) there are 277 URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, when I examine the original seed list I found that there are 3\n&gt; URLs that are syntactically invalid. There is one that has a host name\n&gt; which is capitalized, and which gets rewritten to lowercase.\n\nThis make sense, since by chewing on crawl.log you got 277 URLs + 3 invalid URLs which is same as \n280 original seeds.\n\n&gt; Most confusing is the difference between the seed report and the\n&gt; crawl.log --- where did the 23 URLs go?\n\nSeeds added due redirects will have a discovery path. That is why you missed them in your crawl.log \npass.\nI usually add a comment at the end of the seed list # END OF SEEDS.\nAfter the crawl starts all new seeds due redirects will be added after the comment and it easy to \ndistinguish them from the original seeds.\n\n&gt; I understand that the redirects get added to the seed list, and this\n&gt; accounts for the 304, mostly. (Actually I can account for 303 this\n&gt; way.)\n\nThis might be a bug where a new line, comments or something else is counted as seed. We will have to \ncheck this one.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n"}}
