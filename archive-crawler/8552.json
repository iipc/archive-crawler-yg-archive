Others are consulted every time \nthey&#39;re needed. Unfortunately only reading the source and understanding \nthe crawler&#39;s internals can distinguish those two.\n\nIn particular, you *can* edit the MatchesRegexDecideRule &#39;regex&#39; \nproperty and it will take effect mid-crawl. (I can tell this is the case \nbecause at \n&lt;https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/blob/master/modules/src/main/java/org/archive/modules/deciderules/MatchesRegexDecideRule.java#L61&gt;, \nthe evaluate method that I know is called each time a URI is tested, \nasks for the property value via getRegex every time.)\n\nNote, though, that an mid-crawl edit *won&#39;t* change your configuration \nfile on-disk (the &quot;CXML&quot;).\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 6/24/14, 10:58 PM, src_psu@...

Let&#39;s say I want to change a value\n&gt; in crawl scope (by changing a previously written\n&gt; MatchesRegexDecideRule). Will that change make any effect? If changing\n&gt; values through &quot;browse beans/scripting console&quot; do not make any change\n&gt; mid-crawl, what is their utility?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
