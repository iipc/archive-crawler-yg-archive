Her=\r\nitrix goes through the set of rules in order and for each rule sets the sta=\r\ntus of the URI being tested to ACCEPT, REJECT, or PASS. At the end of the d=\r\necide rules, the status in place is the one used, so even if your MatchesLi=\r\nstRegexDecideRule rejects the URI, a later rule may change that status to A=\r\nCCEPT. For example, your regex might rule out the URI, but if after that ru=\r\nle you have a TransclusionDecideRule, that &quot;accepts any URI whose path-from=\r\n-seed ends in at least one non-navlink hop&quot; (https://webarchive.jira.com/wi=\r\nki/display/Heritrix/Configuring+Crawl+Scope+Using+DecideRules) and is gener=\r\nally used to accept embedded content such as images and videos no matter th=\r\ne URI pattern, the URI would be ruled back in to acceptance. You could try =\r\nmoving your MatchesListRegexDecideRule lower in the chain of rules and see =\r\nif that helps.\n\nLauren Ko\nWeb Archiving Programmer\nUNT Libraries\n__________=\r\n______________________________\nFrom: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com [archi=\r\nve-crawler@yahoogroups.com] on behalf of matteo.ceccarello@...
