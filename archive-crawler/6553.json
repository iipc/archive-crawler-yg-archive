(Thus far, it hasn&#39;t.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 5/28/10 9:27 AM, dechouxb wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; While reading the default H3 configuration I stumbled upon the expectedConcurrency property of BdBModule.\n&gt;\n&gt; The default value is 25 and the documentation refers to oracle&#39;s one stating :\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;  On the other end of the spectrum is the je.lock.nLockTables property, which can specify the number of lock tables. While the default is 1, increasing this number can improve multithreaded concurrency. The value of this property should be a prime number, and should ideally be the nearest prime that is not greater than the number of concurrent threads.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; At first, I thought that the best value should be the prime number just below maxToeThreads but is that really the case? I would guess that the number of concurrent threads (from the database&#39;s point of view) is lower.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would be glad to hear about your experiences and advises about the tuning of this parameter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; Bertrand Dechoux\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
