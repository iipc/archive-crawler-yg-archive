I wanted to make sure I fully\n&gt; understand this rule. \n&gt; \n&gt; When I set the max_trans_hops this is the max number of non-navlink\n&gt; hops that would be allowed from the crawl URI. From what I understand\n&gt; this is used to gather the images references for links that are pulled\n&gt; from sites not within the crawl scope.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I am correct in my above description would a max_trans_hops = 1\n&gt; gather the images referenced in img tags or other similar tags.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you give me a couple examples where you would want max_trans_hops\n&gt;&gt; 1? If this is set to greater than 1 am I potentially pulling down\n&gt; files that I may not wish to download - i.e. resulting in a greater\n&gt; crawl scope than I intended?\n\nEmbed (&#39;E&#39; - eg IMG SRC and FRAME SRC), redirect (&#39;R&#39;), and \n&#39;speculative&#39; (&#39;X&#39; Javascript and plug-in-media) link-hops, if not ruled \nin by another part of the scope (for example, on the target sites), are \nonly followed via transclusion to that number of hops.\n\nSo if you had an offsite FRAME with its own IMGs, those IMGs would only \nbe retrieved if trans-hops was at least 2. Similarly, a redirect to an \noffsite page (1) with a frame (2) with offsite images (3) would only get \nthose images with a trans-hops of 3.\n\nA problem is most likely to arise with &#39;X&#39; links, which are often \n&#39;educated guesswork&#39; extractions, and Heritrix isn&#39;t yet sophisticated \nenough to know if the &#39;X&#39; is a true inline inclusion (eg: Javascript \nwhich loads a mouseover image or in-page edit) or a navigation link to a \nnew location. So we treat all &#39;X&#39; hops as inline inclusions, but offer \nanother setting, max-speculative-hops (usually set to 1) to keep \nchains-of-&#39;X&#39;-hops from getting out of hand.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
