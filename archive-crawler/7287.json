The supplied default configuration template in H3 \ndemonstrates how they can be listed inline, in the configuration file \nitself. That template also includes a commented-out section marked \n&#39;SEEDS ALTERNATE APPROACH&#39; which shows how an external file can be used \nfor these initial seeds instead, if desired. (Only one or the other of \nthe TextSeedsModule beans should be active at a time.)\n\nAfter the job is launched, the CXML is not re-consulted, so for a crawl \nalready running, another technique must be used.\n\nThe &#39;Action Directory&#39; is the easiest: you just drop a new file with the \nsuffix &quot;.seeds&quot; into the directory, and the crawl will detect and \nprocess that file, moving it to the &#39;done&#39; directory (so that the \n&#39;action&#39; directory stays empty).\n\nFor example, the file could be called &quot;monday.seeds&quot; and use the same \nline-by-line notation (including &#39;+&#39; and &#39;-&#39; directives which can affect \nscope) as when included at initial launch time.\n\nIt&#39;s best to compose this file elsewhere and then move it to the \n&#39;action&#39; directory as a final atomic step... otherwise while \neditting/appending to it, it may be processes and moved-aside in partial \nform.\n\nIt is not necessary to pause the crawl before dropping a new file into \nthe &#39;action&#39; directory.\n\nIf you need URLs added in ways other than as &#39;seeds&#39; ï¿½ for example, \nforce-refetched, treated-as-already-included, or \nenqueued-with-hops-and-via, then the other suffixes (&quot;.force&quot;, \n&quot;.include&quot;, &quot;.schedule&quot;) documented on that web page may also be of \ninterest. (I&#39;m going to improve the explanation there a bit.)\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 8/19/11 7:36 AM, Tom Zeithaml wrote:\n&gt; Hi all, I want to crawl a big set of Domains using H3 and have many\n&gt; questions how to organize the jobs.

Is it needed to pause the job over the api ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe someone can give me some hints\n&gt;\n&gt; Tom\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
