This is needed so crawls can be launched and controlled by a \nseparate crawl controller application.  A distinct crawl controller \nimplementation we intend experimenting with in the 1.6 time frame will \nattempt coordination of multiple Heritrix instances doing crawls that \nare larger than a single-machine can handle.  We also intend addressing \ncheckpointing, as well as continuing to work on improving memory usage \nand overall performance.  We&#39;re aiming for a June/July release.\n\nWhat else do folks think we need to address in 1.6?  Is there anyting in \nparticular on the list of RFEs -- \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102 -- that \npeople would like us to prioritize?\n\nYours,\nHeritrix Crew\n\n(The above is adapted from Gordon&#39;s RoadMap page: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?HeritrixRoadmapFor2005).\n\n\n"}}
