Stack replied concerning my need to be able to \npass attributes from a parent URI (i.e. a CrawlURI) to children\n(i.e. CandidateURIs), preferably by the AList method:\n\nSt. Ack wrote:\n&gt; Try it now. The AList has been moved back into the CandidateURI and\n&gt; put behind accessors/getters. CrawlURIs made from CandidateURIs \n&gt; inside in Frontier will have whatever was in the CandidateURI AList\n&gt; when CrawlURI was created.\n\nWell today I downloaded the current snapshot and finally got it \nrunning (this was my first time trying to build from CVS source).\nI successfully compiled my code against the new snapshot but at\nrun-time something very strange happened: a runtime error from my\nPostselector subclass&#39;s innerProcess method.  The statement in\nquestion is:\n\n   protected void innerProcess ( CrawlURI curi ) {\n                  :\n     if (curi.containsKey(A_PREREQUISITE_URI)) {\n\nThe runtime error is that there is no containsKey(String) method\nin CrawlURI (!):\n\n   java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:   \n   org.archive.crawler.datamodel.CrawlURI.containsKey\n   (Ljava/lang/String;)\n\nA similar message happens for all the AList-related methods that \nwere recently moved out of CrawlURI into CandidateURI.  This error\njust makes no sense to me.  CrawlURI definitely subclasses \nCandidateURI, CandidateURI definitely has the containsKey method,\nthe javadocs (which I generated today from the downloaded source)\nclearly say that CrawlURI inherits this method from CandidateURI,\nand my Postselector subclass did, after all, compile.\n\nI am runnning with Sun&#39;s JRE build 1.4.1_02-b06, but I doubt that\nmatters.\n\nAny suggestions of where to look or what to test further?\n\n&gt; Refactorings to come will probably include adding a flag on \n&gt; the AList setters so you can say whether your data is \n&gt; transient or not -- i.e. whether it can be discarded at the \n&gt; end of a pass through the processing chain (may also be \n&gt; whether or not value should be serialized too TBD) -- and the\n&gt; Postselector will probably be broken in two with one piece\n&gt; focused on scope-checking and the other on scheduling.\n\nThose sound like reasonable plans.  I also would like to have\nback the protected CreateCandidateURI () method you designed\nthe other day.  I&#39;d rather override just that method rather \nthan the whole innerProcess of Postselector.\n\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt;St.Ack\n\nbergmark_d wrote:\n...\n\n&gt; What I would like: CandidateURI has an AList (null by default). The\n&gt; CreateCandidateURI method can be overridden (i.e. it has protected\n&gt; status) so that applications can stuff stuff (!!) into the\ncandidate&#39;s\n&gt; AList. When a CrawlURI is instantiated from a CandidateURI, it\nshould\n&gt; *merge* its Core Attribute thingies with whatever AList is in the\n&gt; CandidateURI.\n&gt;\nWe figured (smile).\n\n&gt; Given this implementation, it would be easy for apps to arrange for\n&gt; parent URIs to pass info to their children. And that would be good.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
