The one known limitation currently is\nthe resolution of files with relative paths, which (with the exception of\nfiles specified in the extends attribute) will be resolved relative to the\nchild configuration file.\n\nWhat follows is a discussion of the merits of this implementation, you can\nprobably skip it if you just care about making this work, but should\nprobably read on if you&#39;re writing code that uses these configuration\nfiles:\n\nOptimally this would have been done by parsing the &#39;root&#39; configuration\nfile, building a dom, then iterating through each successive child\nadjusting the dom accordingly.  Instead the crawler simply tries to find a\nnode in the current configuration file, and if it can&#39;t it looks at the\nparent (along down the line).\n\nWhile this works, particularly with our simple configuration files, it&#39;s\nnot the greatest.  For example if the crawler were to select all limits \n(//limits/) and the child configuration file had overridden just the max \ntoes limit:\n\n&lt;limits&gt;\n  &lt;max-toe-threads value=&quot;100&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/limits&gt;\n\nonly the max-toe-threads node would be visible, even though the other \nlimits had been defined in the parent configuration file and are otherwise \naccessible when selected by name (e.g. //limits/max-pages/).\n\nFor now we should just be conscious of these limitations, but at some point\nwe may want to look for a better way.  I would suspect actually that there\nis/will be a project out there that addresses this, as it seems like a\ncommon problem, or perhaps we&#39;ll decide it&#39;s worth solving ourselves.\n\npt.\n-- \nParker Thompson\nThe Internet Archive\n510.541.0125\n\n\n"}}
