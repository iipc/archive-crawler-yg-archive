As far as I understand\n&gt; unsing this rule in a DecidingScope will accept pages one hop away from my\n&gt; original scope. What exactly happens when I\n&gt; \n&gt; - use a SurtPrefixedDecideRule to accept all pages from SURTS expanded from my\n&gt; seedlist\n&gt; - set the also-check-via of this rule to &quot;true&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; My understanding so far is that setting &quot;also-check-via&quot; to true will expand the\n&gt; scope by one hop. Will using the ScopePlusOneDecideRule expand this by another\n&gt; hop or is this redundant?\n\nScopePlusOneDecideRule and the also-check-via setting on other rules \nboth do essentially the same thing. (The ScopePlusOneDecideRule is \neliminated from Heritrix 2 as redundant.)\n\nIn neither case is it truly &quot;1 more hop&quot;, but rather they each rule a \nURI in if it fits directly on your specified SURT/URI prefixes, or if \nthe URI from which the current URI was discovered (its &#39;via&#39;) fits on \nyour specified SURT/URI prefixes. (So, for example, if a URI was \nruled-in by some other non-SURT-based rule, no &#39;extra hop&#39; from there \nwill be allowed.)\n\nAlso, they are not additive; each only looks back one hop -- to the \n&#39;via&#39; URI.\n\n&gt; The reason I&#39;m asking is this scenario. I&#39;d like to crawl all domains that are\n&gt; in my seedlist and in addition I would like to crawl all &quot;neighbouring&quot; domains,\n&gt; that is, all domains connected by one link to the domains on the seedlist. I&#39;d\n&gt; like to allow the crawler to get as many pages from this &quot;neighbouring&quot; domains\n&gt; as possible, but not to wander away to far from the seed-domains to restrict the\n&gt; focus of the whole crawl. Is this possible using some clever combination of\n&gt; rules I haven&#39;t thought about yer?\n\nThis would take writing a custom rule, either in Java or as a beanshell \nscript for the BeanshellDecideRule, because it requires in/out decisions \nto be made based on knowledge collected during a crawl. Presumably, when \nit first considers a URI on a neighboring domain, it would add that \ndomain to a list of approved secondary domains.\n\nNote that some decisions would be subject to the order in which paths \nare discovered. Consider this case:\n\n- You are crawling site A, and discover a link to site B, so B gets \ndynamically added as a neighbor you want to crawl.\n- While crawling B, you discover a link to site C, which is rejected.\n- Later while continuing to crawl deep in A, you discover a link to C, \nso C gets dynamically added as a neighbor.\n\nWhether or not that initial link to C is rediscovered depends on whether \nanother instance is found; links previously rejected won&#39;t be reconsidered.\n\nThis might not be an issue for common sites with strong internal \nnavigational cross-links, but it is something to be aware of.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Any help appreciated,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Christoph\n\n"}}
