I haven&#39;t done any serious crawling=\r\n with\nit, only test crawls, but so far so good.  And yes, this should allow=\r\n\nHeritrix to sit on top of S3.  I&#39;ll go ahead and add an RFE over on\nsource=\r\nforge.  In the meantime, I have a couple of small questions that\nwould best=\r\n be answered by someone more familiar with the Heritrix\nsource code.  They =\r\nare:\n\n1. I&#39;d like to add a drop-down menu on the Settings page for\nCompress=\r\nion type.  The mutually exclusive options are DEFAULT, NONE,\nRECORD, and BL=\r\nOCK.  I don&#39;t know how to get Heritrix to do this.  When\nI add the option a=\r\ns follows ...\n\nString [] values =3D { &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, &quot;NONE&quot;, &quot;BLOCK&quot;, &quot;RECORD&quot; =\r\n}\n\ne =3D addElementToDefinition(new SimpleType(ATTR_HDFS_COMPRESSION_TYPE,\n=\r\n          &quot;Compression type to use for HDFS SequenceFiles. &quot; +\n          &quot;V=\r\nalid values are: DEFAULT, BLOCK, RECORD, NONE.&quot;,  \n          values));\n\nThe=\r\n Settings page comes up with some sort of object encoding string\n(something=\r\n like values@231a).  How can I do this?\n\n2. I had to modify the file io/Wri=\r\nterPoolSettings.java to include the\nfollowing new interface methods:\n\n    p=\r\nublic String getJobDir();\n    public String getHdfsBaseDir();\n    public St=\r\nring getHdfsCompressionType();\n    public int getHdfsReplication();\n\nThis s=\r\neemed a little ugly.  Is there a better way to pass this\nsettings informati=\r\non down into the HDFSWriterPool ?\n\n- Doug\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Excellent!  I&#39;d suggest openin=\r\ng an RFE over on sourceforge and add what \n&gt; you have there as a patch.  Th=\r\nen lets chat more.   It might make sense \n&gt; packaging the addition as an ad=\r\nd-on jar that people can optionally add \n&gt; to their Heritrix download.  It =\r\nwould also be interesting to hear some \n&gt; of your experiences/observations =\r\ncrawling to HDFS if you don&#39;t mind\n(I&#39;m \n&gt; guessing to that with your patch=\r\n, we should be able to use the HDFS S3 \n&gt; filesystem implementation just by=\r\n making a minor change in the \n&gt; configuration).\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; nugget=\r\nwheat wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just getting started working with H=\r\neritrix. I&#39;ve implemented a\n&gt; &gt; Writer processor called HDFSWriterProcessor=\r\n to write content directly\n&gt; &gt; into the Hadoop Distributed Filesystem. For =\r\nthose of you not familiar\n&gt; &gt; with Hadoop, it is an open source implementat=\r\nion of the Google File\n&gt; &gt; System and Map/Reduce system. It stores files by=\r\n breaking them into\n&gt; &gt; chunks and distributing n replicas of each chunk ac=\r\nross different\n&gt; &gt; nodes. It allows you to do high-speed distributed proces=\r\nsing of your\n&gt; &gt; crawled data reliably, using a large cluster of machines.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The code is mostly isolated to new source files, but I had to make =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; couple of small changes to some of the existing interfaces. If there\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; is any interest, I&#39;m willing to offer it to the project.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Doug=\r\n Judd\n&gt; &gt; www.zvents.com\n&gt; &gt; doug@... &lt;mailto:doug%40zvents.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
