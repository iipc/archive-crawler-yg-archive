I can&#39;t connect via either the\n&gt; JConsole application nor the command line also.\n&gt;\n&gt; The process is that I have 10 heritrix instances up (within the one\n&gt; jvm) and I look for an available crawler mbean (via a jmx query) when\n&gt; a job needs to be submitted.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone know of any issues like this? I am using Heritrix 1.12.1\n&gt; and java build 1.5.0_11-b03.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see no OOME or anything in the logs. But, if I run &#39;top&#39; I can see\n&gt; that the CPU usage has spiked to 100%. But, the current crawls I have\n&gt; seem to be stalled (no more output to the logs or the arc files have\n&gt; been appended for over a day).\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope this is enough info to jog some memories if the issue has been\n&gt; seen before.\n&gt;\n&gt; --briggs\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
