Thus it&#39;s still for \nadventurous developers curious about the crawler internals.\n\nAs soon as the branch web UI reaches rough parity with the web UI of \n1.X, so that expert users who can run from SVN snapshots/auto-builds \nwould be comfortable exploring, the branch will be merged back into the \nSVN trunk.\n\nWhen the changes are stable enough for our standard suite of crawls, it \nwill become a 2.0.0 candidate release and then official release. Even \nthen, those running regular crawls, and familiar with the old Heritrix, \nmay choose to linger on 1.12.1 for a while, rather than immediately \ntaking the adjustment hit. Major new functionality in frontier \nconfiguration and control is planned for 2.2 about 2 months after 2.0.\n\nSo:\n- 1.12.1 is the latest-and-greatest official release\n- SVN trunk is still 1.12.1-based\n- 2.0.0 work is underway in the &#39;pjack_settings&#39; branch, but would be a \nchallenging way to get started with Heritrix until this work comes back \ninto trunk\n\nHope this helps you make the right choice for your interests,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nPaul Jack wrote:\n&gt; Heritrix 2.0 development is proceeding in the svn branch  \n&gt; pjack_settings.

When I checkout and build from svn, it says it is still like\n&gt;&gt; 1.13.x. I also saw mention that you are moving from maven 1.x to 2.x\n&gt;&gt; and the trunk of svn (heritrix) still only builds with maven 1.x.
