Our ExtractorSWF can find \nstatic outlink URLs from SWF resources, but not dynamically-composed URLs.\n\nSometimes the formulas for creating these URLs are predictable, and then \neither the ExtractorImpliedURI or some custom script code (via the \nScriptedProcessor) can be configured, with effort, to auto-generate a \ncandidate outlink URI from either the source URI, or one of the \ntriggering outlink URIs found another way.\n\nHowever, these hand-crafted rules tend to decay rapidly -- many of the \nsites that dynamically compose FLV URLs are regularly changing the form \nof final URLs, perhaps even to thwart automated collection.\n\nAnother technique is to ask a full web browser, under remote control, to \nvisit candidate pages and then observe the URLs it requests -- for \nexample by sending all its requests through a web proxy. (The proxy \ncould record to WARCs, or share the discovered URL lists with another \ncrawler.)\n\nTools for performing web app unit tests with browsers (such as Selenium) \nor for creating scriptable/&#39;headless&#39; browsers (like &#39;Crowbar&#39; or \nQT-WebKit) can prove helpful here. We&#39;ve used this technique for a QA \ntool that&#39;s called &#39;Browser Monkeys&#39; and other ad hoc crawling, but not \nyet integrated these things into the Heritrix codebase.\n\nAlso, the above techiques are limited to discovering full videos that \nare fetched as HTTP. Streamed video over other protocols (as sometimes \nalso seen in Flash video playback) requires different techniques.\n\nSome projects have had success detecting candidate streams during a \nnormal Heritrix crawl, but then offloading stream-requests to the \n&#39;mplayer&#39; tool on Linux, which can dump the retrieved video to a file. \nThe paper by Nicholas Baly in the IWAW&#39;06 proceedings gave an overview \nof this general technique at that time:\n\nhttp://iwaw.europarchive.org/06/\n\nI believe other European archiving efforts have updated Baly&#39;s work to \narchive various audio/video streams on an ongoing basis... anyone have \nmore details?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
