I intended to log the links not harvested because =\r\n\n&gt; of reaching the maximum set distance from seed.\n\nThe logs record the fin=\r\nal status of a URI fetch, but there are\ndifferent fetch handlers. Such as a=\r\nn FTP fetcher would log the status\ncode if there was an FTP error. So all n=\r\negative status codes are\ngenerated by Heritrix.\n\nI could not find anywhere =\r\nin the source where -4001 was being returned\nas the status code, but there =\r\nare decider rules that return true/false\nif to many link hops are found fro=\r\nm the seed. So I assume that -4001\nis a calculated value.\n\nCan anyone direc=\r\nt me to where CrawlURI.setFetchStatus is being called\nwith -4001? I could n=\r\not find it, and this has be really puzzled.\n\nI also found that a URI will n=\r\not be rejected right away if it is to\nmany links from the hop. It will be t=\r\nried again until all seeds have\nbeen checked.\n\nFor example; if you had thes=\r\ne seeds\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com\nhttp://www.cnn.com/news/america/somewhere\n\nSo t=\r\nhe below URL would be accepted because it&#39;s not past the max hops\nfor the s=\r\necond seed, but it fails for the first seed.\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/news/ameri=\r\nca/somewhere/my/pages.html\n\nHope that helps?\n\n\n"}}
