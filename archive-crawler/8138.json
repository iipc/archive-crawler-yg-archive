Is there a sample? Please guide me.\n\nLong description:\nI have a very big=\r\n project which needs a good crawler. It is used mainly for archiving web pa=\r\nges but in a special way. My previous solution was to use crawler4j because=\r\n it let me easily use my own code for processing downloaded contents. Howev=\r\ner, due to numerous limitations, I had to move to a better crawler and Heri=\r\ntrix seemed like the perfect choice.\n\nMy question is, how can I create my o=\r\nwn custom logic for saving documents?\n\nSo far, I have downloaded the projec=\r\nt&#39;s source, imported it in Eclipse and added the .jar files from the downlo=\r\naded distributed package to classpath. Then I passed the required arguments=\r\n to the org.archive.crawler.Heritrix class and it doesn&#39;t contain any error=\r\ns and I can access to the web UI. Although it is a little different from wh=\r\nat I read in the documentation. (for instance it doesn&#39;t contain any tabs).=\r\n Is there something wrong here or is this the new UI for 3.1?\n\nNow, back to=\r\n my question? What should I do to manually handle saving documents? I want =\r\nto download EVERY file type on the web. I want to be able to get the docume=\r\nnt type because I have to handle HTMLs, JS files, CSS files and other types=\r\n differently. And there is a chance that at some points, I need to pause ot=\r\nher threads, do some work and then resume the work in order to safely save =\r\nfiles on the disk.\n\nI&#39;m faily new to Heritrix and I&#39;m reading the documenta=\r\ntion as fast as I can. However I&#39;d appreciate if you could point me in the =\r\nright direction since I have to deliver this soon and I can&#39;t delay the pro=\r\nject for much.\n\n\n\n"}}
