The StatisticsTracker assumes you want rep=\r\norts (see how its \n&gt; crawlEnded() method calls dumpReports()), and it&#39;s gen=\r\nerally assumed a \n&gt; StatisticsTracker will be present.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, since =\r\nthat&#39;s handled by the public method \n&gt; StatisticsTracker.dumpReports(), sim=\r\nply creating your own subclass of \n&gt; StatisticsTracker that doesn&#39;t do anyt=\r\nhing there should do the trick.\n&gt; \n&gt; And further, a feature of the Spring c=\r\nonfiguration framework we&#39;re using \n&gt; is that you can even create new class=\r\nes *in your configuration file(s)* \n&gt; -- sparing you the need to add an Jav=\r\na classes to your build. See:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://static.springsource.org/spring/do=\r\ncs/2.5.x/reference/dynamic-language.html#dynamic-language-beans\n&gt; \n&gt; So it =\r\nshouldn&#39;t be hard to suppress reports in your crawls.
