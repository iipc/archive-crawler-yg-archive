As part of that, I&#39;m\n&gt; doing a unit test, which is showing me that the result of\n&gt; HostnameQueueAssignmentPolicy.getClassKey isn&#39;t exactly the domain name,\n&gt; but can also include port number at least.  Is there some fixed\n&gt; definition of the queue key format, or should I just assume that\n&gt; whatever the source says is definition enough (I generally don&#39;t like\n&gt; doing the latter, since source-based definitions are rarely stable)?\n\nQueue names can be arbitrary Strings -- the exact format depends on the\nQueueAssignmentPolicy in use. Other parts of the code are not looking\ninto the Strings for meaningful info -- as far as the code is concerned,\nthey&#39;re arbitrary opaque keys. So, the most important consumer of the key\n&#39;format&#39; is probably the human operator who will occasionally view these\nqueue names in Frontier reports.\n\nHistorically (pre-BDB), we ensured that queue names were valid filenames,\nsince each queue was represented by several files with names derived from\nthe queue name. Using BdbFrontier, this isn&#39;t imperative, and if a future\nnew Frontier again wants to use queue names to help generate file names,\nit could handle the necessary escaping itself.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
