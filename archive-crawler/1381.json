I did not know the new method had\nthe CrawlURI in it, because I&#39;d not downloaded HEAD yet.  \n\nSo, inside createCandidateURI we have all of the CrawlURI available,\nincluding things the application has added to the AList.  That&#39;s\ngood. \n&gt; \n&gt; As to the AList issue, thats a bit tougher.  Seems little point\n&gt; setting you up if there is no place to stuff data to carry across \n&gt; the crawl.  \n\nRight!\n\n&gt; Looking at the creation of the CrawlURI from the\n&gt; CandidateURI over in the Frontier, the way it currently works is\n&gt; that a new CrawlURI instance  is created and a set of CandidateURI\ndata is copied into it.  So you&#39;ll \n&gt; need to have overrides in this location too to get your appended \n&gt; CandidateURI data added the new CrawlURI instance.\n\nYeh, I was afraid of that.  I planned to address the\nputting-onto-the-frontier issue first, and then attack the\ntaking-off-the frontier issue next.  \n\n\n&gt; We&#39;re having a chat here in-house looking at a couple of things.\n&gt; We&#39;ll be back to you hopefully with a proposal that gets you what\nyou need.\n&gt; \n\nGood!  You guys are great.\n\nWhat I would like:  CandidateURI has an AList (null by default).  The\nCreateCandidateURI method can be overridden (i.e. it has protected\nstatus) so that applications can stuff stuff (!!) into the candidate&#39;s\nAList.  When a CrawlURI is instantiated from a CandidateURI, it should\n*merge* its Core Attribute thingies with whatever AList is in the\nCandidateURI.\n\nGiven this implementation, it would be easy for apps to arrange for\nparent URIs to pass info to their children.  And that would be good. \n\n-D\n\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for working on this.  I think Heritrix has great\n&gt; &gt; potential for being THE open-source crawler. - D.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@a...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bergmark_d wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ooops, not so elegant.  Referring to my post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just a little earlier, --- there is no ref to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Parent URI (&quot;curi&quot;) in the schedule method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So will be hard to copy info from parent to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child URI.  This needs more thought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Try &#39;CandidateURI#getVia&#39;.  Returned type is Object but in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; override context should always be an UURI instance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also did some more refactoring.  I made handleLinkCollection\n&gt; &gt; &gt; protected (handlePrerequisites already was protected rather than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; private) and added createCandidateUri, a method that both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; handleLinkCollection and handlePrerequisites use to create a\n&gt; &gt; CandidateURI instance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us know if this is still not sufficent -- or if you have\nbetter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; refactoring suggestion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bergmark_d&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bergmark@C...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I believe making Postselector:schedule protected will\ndo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trick. The main problem will be that CandidateURI&#39;s\nhave no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AList (I wish they did!)  But thanks much -- this is an\nelegant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution.

Makes sense.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Heritrix, I can see where attributes could be copied\ninto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child URIs -- in the handleLinkCollection method of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Postselector class, for example, when the CandidateURI\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formed.  So I would like to extend Postselector and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over-ride just this one method, but it is private.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How do you all decide which methods to make protected\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which private?  Maybe it would be nice to allow the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; application programmer to add attributes to the\n&gt; &gt; CandidateURI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before it goes onto the frontier, perhaps by some\ncall-back\n&gt; &gt; or by factoring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out a protected and over-ridable method that decorates\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CandidateURI.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I made the Postselector#schedule method protected so you\ncan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; override it in HEAD.
