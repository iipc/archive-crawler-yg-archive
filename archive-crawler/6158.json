(Some guy is using extra bandwidth, so I\ncan bill more? Great. . .) Or no clue that they even should.\n\nJohn\n\n\nS�ren Vejrup Carlsen wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi all.\n&gt; Is it possible in Heritrix 1.14.3 to avoid overloading webservers \n&gt; hosting many virtual servers.\n&gt; We currently have the problem that those webservers often choose to \n&gt; ban our harvesters from their site.\n&gt; And we would very much like to avoid that.\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; S�ren Vejrup Carlsen, NetarchiveSuite developer\n&gt; Department of Digital Preservation, Royal Library, Copenhagen, Denmark\n&gt; tlf: (+45) 33 47 48 41\n&gt; email: svc@... &lt;mailto:svc%40kb.dk&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Non omnia possumus omnes\n&gt; --- Macrobius, Saturnalia, VI, 1, 35 -------\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
