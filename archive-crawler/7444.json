How do you ma=\r\nke html into plain text? \n&gt; There is software that does that, including jav=\r\na libraries (see \n&gt; discussion here \n&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2=\r\n40546/removing-html-from-a-java-string). \n&gt; One thing you could do is code =\r\na custom writer that uses one of these \n&gt; libraries. Then a question is, wh=\r\nere does it write? It could still write \n&gt; to a warc, but if you do that yo=\r\nu&#39;ll want to be careful that what you \n&gt; write conforms to the warc spec. I=\r\nf not warc, then you will have to come \n&gt; up with some other system, which =\r\nmay not be trivial.\n&gt; \n&gt; It might make more sense to convert to plain text =\r\noutside of heritrix, \n&gt; by running some postprocessing on the warcs, althou=\r\ngh that probably also \n&gt; will not be trivial.\n&gt; \n&gt; Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/07/2011 =\r\n05:02 AM, karthiksmv wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I am using heritrix to crawl web pages and =\r\nit stores information like response headers and html tags but I need to rem=\r\nove the response headers and html tags. To make it simple I just want herit=\r\nrix to download the webpage as plain text.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Karthik\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
