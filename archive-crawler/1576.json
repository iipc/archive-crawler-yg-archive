Tom \nemerson&#39;s doc in the FAQ is not available at the moment, so I&#39;m \nguessing on how to do this.\n\nI&#39;ve added the content type regex filters to my midfetch and ARC \nwriters, which seems to be working.  But, non text is still getting \nadded to my frontier, which means I crawl (and then abort) a lot of \nthings I don&#39;t need.\n\nSo, I was going to add a postselector regex filter to only add text \nback into the frontier to crawl.  But, the filters have me confused, \nand it does not seem to be behaving as I would expect.\n\nI have the following settings:\n\nfilters ? Filters applied to this processor \n        URI ? URI regexp filter. \n          enabled:  ?    True  \n          if-match-return:  ?  True  \n          regexp:  ? .*\n(&#92;.gif|&#92;.jpeg|&#92;.jpg|&#92;.mov|&#92;.bmp|&#92;.pic|&#92;.png|&#92;.tiff|&#92;.tif|&#92;.css|&#92;.js|&#92;\n.swf|&#92;.qt|&#92;.mpeg|&#92;.mpg|&#92;.mp3|&#92;.avi|&#92;.wav|&#92;.wmv|&#92;.pdf|&#92;.doc|&#92;.xls|&#92;.cs\nv|&#92;.ppt)$   \n      seed-redirects-new-seed:  ?  True  \n      override-logger:  ?    True \n\nThe thought being if it matches the regex then don&#39;t add it into the \nfrontier.  If I set the if-match-return to True, nothing seems to \nget added to it.  But, if I set it to false, a lot of .gif \nand .jpegs are getting in.  I guess I just don&#39;t understand this \nwhole filter thing.\n\nAny ideas?  (In general, I&#39;d rather use a regex to filter out things \nas above rather than in, but that could be done if necessary)\n\nThanks,\nGreg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
