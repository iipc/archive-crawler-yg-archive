The job\nnames get a formulaic (timestamp) expansion for UI convenience\nand uniqueness within the application&#39;s domain. However, the\nnaming needs for long-term ARC file archival may be different and\nthus can be chosen in separate ARC name options.\n\nJob names should definitely go into the in-ARC header record;\nI&#39;ll make that a clear part of the arc-header spec.\n\n&gt; During harvesting every job has its own directory but in the end one \n&gt; may place all arcs into a bigger pool for further processing. \n&gt; \n&gt; Would a series number be unique only inside a job so you could have \n&gt; files\n&gt; \n&gt; name - 00001 - timestamp1 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt; name - 00001 - timestamp2 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt; name - 00001-  timestamp3 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt; name - 00001 - timestamp4 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt; \n&gt; produced by four different jobs. I somehow think a running series \n&gt; number in an archive implies that no two files in an archive have \n&gt; identical s-numbers (even if their timestamps differ)\n\nThe serial numbers are strictly within a single crawl/job for now.\nAttempting uniqueness over a larger domain would require other\ncoordination between jobs, software runs, software installs, etc.\n\nIt is currently up to the operator to vary the prefix-names on\nsubsequent runs in such a situation. If they don&#39;t, the above\nis possible, which is a potential source of confusion with both\nthe grouping you show, and when you consider that the default\nsort order of the ARCs of separate crawls will be...\n\nname - 00001 - timestamp1 - IP.arc.gz\nname - 00001 - timestamp3 - IP.arc.gz\nname - 00001-  timestamp5 - IP.arc.gz\nname - 00001 - timestamp7 - IP.arc.gz\nname - 00002 - timestamp2 - IP.arc.gz\nname - 00002 - timestamp4 - IP.arc.gz\nname - 00002-  timestamp6 - IP.arc.gz\nname - 00002 - timestamp8 - IP.arc.gz\n\nBecause of this, we&#39;ve decided to keep the timestamp and serial-number\nvalues in the current code&#39;s order, timestamp first, then serial-number,\nso that within a given &#39;name&#39;, the lexicographic sort order will always\nmatch the time-sort order.\n\n&gt; S-number makes file names more unique but it&#39;s not very informative. \n\nWe find the serial numbers helpful as a way to highlight a\nparticular ARC as the container of a resource of interest.\nFor example, &quot;you can grep for the weird server response in ARC\n#27&quot;. The timestamps are somewhat more difficult to use as\ncasual pointers.\n\n&gt; Would it be possible to use job name instead \n&gt; \n&gt; OperatorGivenName - Jobname - Timestamp - IP.arc.gz for example =&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; finland - photoarchives - timestamp - IP.arc.gz\n&gt; \n&gt; Slight problem of course that job names have variable lengths unlike \n&gt; s-numbers.\n\nI suspect many operators will want to make their ARC prefixes\nand jobnames match, but for the reasons listed above, I&#39;d\nrather not enforce that relationship in software.\n\nSome other ideas for the future:\n  - an operator could be offered a easy way (checkbox?) to\n    make the ARC prefix conform to the job name\n  - an operator could be warned if a arc-prefix was used\n    in a known previous crawl, and offered a suggested\n    revision\n  - the crawler could consult an external inventory process\n    somewhere to verify that a proposed crawl name and\n    ARC prefix are unique\n\nAndrew Boyko wrote:\n# The ARC naming proposal sounds good to me.  The only thing I might\n# ponder is the idea of a separate identifier, for the instance of a\n# repeated crawl.   Obviously the operator could just add a suffix to the\n# &#39;operator-given-name&#39;, and the timestamp is a clear key to regularly\n# repeated crawls (monthly or weekly), so this isn&#39;t a big deal.  Even so,\n# it&#39;s still compelling to have the tool auto-generate a sequence number\n# whenever a operator-given-name is reused within an instance of the tool.\n#  Two or three digits would presumably more than cover it.\n#\n# So in the example of repeated Congress crawls (to choose an example at\n# random :), assuming the same instance of the tool is used for each, the\n# seventh ARC for the fifth instance of the crawl would be\n#    CONGRESS005-00007-20040420133907-FG71E2B.arc.gz\n# where the 005 is automatically assigned by the crawler based on the\n# prior instances it knows of, and of course defaults to 001 for any new\n# crawl name.\n\nWe&#39;ve been relying on operator diligence to do this, and picking date-related\nnames -- things like CONGRESS0312 (dec 2003), CONGRESS0401 (jan 2004), etc.\n\nI agree automating this would be a big operator convenience For the current\nupdate, though, we&#39;ll leave this as a manual practice rather than rush in\nan automated system that might be constraining.\n\n# As far as the new header block, why not add the entire crawl order and\n# seed list?  A couple K added to a 100MB file shouldn&#39;t worry anyone.\n\nExcellent point. It might also be achieved as a special record\npast the header; perhaps even as a crawler self-fetch, like...\n\n   http://127.0.0.1:8080/currentcrawl/order.xml\n\nIt might be sufficient to do this only for the first ARC, or otherwise\ninclude this info by reference where preferred by the operator.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n"}}
