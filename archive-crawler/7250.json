At the slow-d=\r\nown time, the max heap is being used, congestion ratio high, and all thread=\r\ns active. \n\nRecently after trying to monitor crawl progress using jvisualvm=\r\n I the heap usage is generally steady rising and falling near the max heap.=\r\n The thread activity shows most of the threads stopped at &quot;Monitor.&quot; A thre=\r\nad dump shows messages like:\n&quot;ToeThread #159: http://xqueso.tumblr.com/ask&quot;=\r\n prio=3D4 tid=3D196954800 nid=3D0x1a50db000 waiting for monitor entry [1a50=\r\nda000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)\n\tat org.archi=\r\nve.crawler.postprocessor.FrontierScheduler.innerProcess(FrontierScheduler.j=\r\nava:76)\n\t- waiting to lock &lt;111c81320&gt; (a org.archive.crawler.postprocessor=\r\n.FrontierScheduler)\n\tat org.archive.crawler.framework.Processor.process(Pro=\r\ncessor.java:109)\n\tat org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.processCrawlUr=\r\ni(ToeThread.java:306)\n\tat org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.run(ToeTh=\r\nread.java:154)\n\n   Locked ownable synchronizers:\n\t- None\n\nIt looks like the=\r\n reason for the slow-down is that most of the threads are blocked, with onl=\r\ny some of them actually running. \n\nDoes anyone have strategies for how to r=\r\neduce this sort of thread contention by changing settings? \n\nLately I&#39;ve be=\r\nen trying to see if changing the # of threads will help reduce it-I was ori=\r\nginally using 160 as max-threads, and now I&#39;m testing 80, but it doesn&#39;t se=\r\nem to be making a significant difference, except in the latter case the max=\r\nimum heap gets used up immediately within a few minutes, while in the forme=\r\nr it takes about an hour to reach max heap usage.\n\nAnyway, the point is I&#39;m=\r\n a little stuck and any insights or suggestions would be really appreciated=\r\n!\n\n\n"}}
