I sort of expected this, given the warnings re broad \n&gt; scope in the documentation, but I am wondering: is there any use in \n&gt; resuming the job (I crawled about half as much the data I would like to \n&gt; crawl), or will it get out of memory again soon anyway? Any other solution? \n&gt; (e.g., some setting I can change on the fly?)\n\nIn my experience the crawl is pretty much dead at that point. I have\nyet to succeed in doing anything beyond shutting it down. I&#39;m\nre-running a crawl that ran out of memory spectacularly in 1.4 (this\nwith a 1G Java heap, SURT prefix scope) on a 1.5 snapshot and it has\nbeen able to get a bit further.\n\nThere was a discussion of this a while ago: perhaps the archives will\nhave some of the IAs tips on this.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n &quot;You can&#39;t fake quality any more than you can fake a good meal.&quot; (W.S.B.)\n\n"}}
