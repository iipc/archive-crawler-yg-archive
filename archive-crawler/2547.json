I am running Hertirix 1.2 on windows XP/2003, and have \ncome to =\r\na sticking point.  \n\nWhen I extract the files from the arc the HTML contain=\r\ned within \nchanges all references to be local/relative.  This is good.  \nUn=\r\nfortunately it references them via &lt;page-name&gt;?&lt;param1&gt;=3D&lt;param1-\nvalue&gt; a=\r\nnd so on.\n\nSo that the following are two distinct pages:\n\ndynamicPage.asp?g=\r\net=3DsomeInfo\ndynamicPage.asp?get=3DotherInfo\n\nso as I extract the files fr=\r\nom the ARC i need to save them using the \npage name and the URL parameters.=\r\n  BUT WINDOWS (yes lovely windows) \ndoes not allow me to save a file witha =\r\n &quot;?&quot; in the name of the file.\n\nwhat I thought would be a lovely solution wo=\r\nuld be to add a custom \nmodule or extend an existing one, that would allow =\r\nme to rewrite the \nurl (in the hrefs) replacing the &quot;?&quot; with somthing more =\r\nbenign like \na &quot;-&quot;.  \n\nUnforutnately I am confused as to where to start loo=\r\nking. can someone \npoint me in the right direction? (obviously the less cod=\r\ne the \nbetter)...\n\nThank you\n\ntodd\n\n\n\n\n"}}
