The short answer is, you cannot\n&gt; filter by language.\n&gt; \n&gt; The longer answer is, you could write a *new* deciding scope rule\n&gt; based on ContentTypeMatchesRegExpDecideRule which filters on the\n&gt; Content-Language HTTP header (see section 14.12 of\n&gt; &lt;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt&gt;. But this HTTP header is little\n&gt; used. You absolutely cannot rely on English-language websites\n&gt; identifying themselves using the HTTP header Content-Language: en. You\n&gt; might be able to filter out sites which use the Content-Language\n&gt; header to identify themselves as being *not* English-language sites.\n&gt; But this will not be very effective.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, the special characters were unicode quote marks. I have\n&gt; avoided them in this message.\n&gt; \n&gt; best,\n&gt; Erik Hetzner\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n&gt; ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\n\n"}}
