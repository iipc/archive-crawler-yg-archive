Or is it a\n&gt; matter of attempting recovery for each crawler?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, Roger\n\nIn general Heritrix and the BerkeleyDB-JE library don&#39;t handle disk-full \nerrors gracefully, because writes-that-must-succeed happen deep in many \noperations that can&#39;t be easily held-and-retried after some \narbitrarily-later disk cleanup.\n\nA /state/ directory that&#39;s failed to take in-process writes is \nessentially corrupt. You&#39;d want to rollback to a previously-valid \nstate... either starting fresh or from a cleanly-completely prior \ncheckpoint.\n\nSo it is essentially a restart-and-recover situation.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
