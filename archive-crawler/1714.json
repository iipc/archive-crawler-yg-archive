So for example you go to this directory site and you say well\nlet me see what computer companies are out there and then you click on\ncomptuers and u get a list of all the comp stores out there etc. Then\nas a user u get to review them etc. The problem is everytime I put in\na seed url such as:\n\nhttp://www.google.ie/search?q=web+design&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\n\nIt wont start, well thats not true its starts and finishes but\nthereare no statistics all which suggests to me that it simply isnt\nstarting. The wierd thing is that if I use any domain as a\nseed URL will work fine. I would really really appreciate someone\nexplaining to me why this is happening. I cant find any refference in\nthe documentation and Im at my wits end.\n\nOh and this is all being done through the Web User Interface because\nits a very simple thing Im looking for.\n\nDave\n\n"}}
