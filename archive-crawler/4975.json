We&#39;d like your\n&gt; opinions before we proceed.\n&gt;\n&gt; The IA and its major partners in the project (the libraries of the Int&#39;l\n&gt; Internet Preservation Consortium) are all equally comfortable with the\n&gt; Apache License as the LGPL, and using the Apache license would allow\n&gt; easier integration with other Apache-centric projects of keen interest\n&gt; to our community, such as Lucene/Nutch/Hadoop. (We also extensively\n&gt; benefit from Apache project libraries in Heritrix, and in the spirit of\n&gt; reciprocity would like our work to be freely reusable by other Apache\n&gt; projects.)\n&gt;\n&gt; For reference, the relevant Apache License is here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html \n&gt; &lt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Any transition would be gradual, as we ensure notable non-IA\n&gt; contributors approve the relicensing, and communicate that future\n&gt; contributions will become part of the project under the new license.\n&gt;\n&gt; To maintain the widest possible license compatibility in the face of\n&gt; arcane and sometimes disputed matters of interpretation (such as whether\n&gt; Apache License 2 is compatible with GPL 2), we may also continue to\n&gt; offer LGPL as an simultaneous license option, indefinitely.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do people have opinions, positive or negative, about this contemplated\n&gt; move? Any concerns that should be addressed?\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
