See:\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html\n\nI presume that this also includes the GPL3-derived LGPL 3.0.\n\nAs noted at that link, the ASF and FSF may disagree about certain \ncombinations of earlier licenses, but in a work for which your \norganization is the rightsholder, I&#39;m not even sure strict \n&#39;compatibility&#39; is required. Heritrix under either LGPL or Apache may be \nredistributed and integrated as part of larger packages, no matter what \nthe enclosing package&#39;s licenses.\n\nThe only controversy in this area that I recall hearing about was when \none GPL&#39;d project removed the Apache license notice from certain code \nand placed a GPL-based license in its place. I doubt you&#39;re planning that.\n\nIf this were demonstrated to be a problem, we could consider \ndual-licensing under Apache and LGPL indefinitely. But, I&#39;d rather avoid \nthat complexity, if not absolutely necessary.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
