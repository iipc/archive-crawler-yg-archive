Does the online policy explicitly \n&gt; bar robots?  The NYT policy seems to allow crawler access if the \n&gt; downloads are for personal use only.  Perhaps WPOST is the same.&lt;/aside&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Back to debugging.  You can log in with your browser, right?  \n&gt; Programmatic login by Heritrix is difficult to debug;  You could\nlook in \n&gt; crawl logs to see whats happening on submission (Are you redirected, is \n&gt; it 200 on POST?) and in the ARC files to see what the login result\npages \n&gt; you&#39;re getting back look like -- how do they compare to the browser \n&gt; pages?  You might try doing the login negotiation using CURL first -- \n&gt; because it&#39;ll be easier to follow the login vagaries in a tool like\nCURL \n&gt; -- to learn more about how it works before trying the login in Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *Yahoo!
