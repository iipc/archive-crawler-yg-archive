We&#39;ve somewhat modified heritrix\nfor=\r\n our\n&gt; purposes but I&#39;m sure you could do it with the release version. \nBas=\r\nically\n&gt; all you need is enough Internet bandwidth, good DNS and multiple c=\r\nrawler\n&gt; instances.  We have 10Mbit/s and with our set up we saturated that=\r\n\nwith 4\n&gt; crawler instances running on single cpu dual core Xeon boxes, eac=\r\nh\nwith 8GB\n&gt; memory, used 5GB for java heap.  Each machine needs a boatload=\r\n of disk\n&gt; space, not just for the content but for checkpoints (which we ac=\r\ntually\n&gt; turned off since we&#39;ve been unable to restart a big, multi-million=\r\n page\n&gt; crawl from checkpoint, although it works fine for smaller crawls)\na=\r\nnd for\n&gt; the various BDB instances used by the crawler for queueing uri&#39;s. =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The crawl rate did slow down for us substantially towards the=\r\n end of the\n&gt; month.  I don&#39;t know why, and it&#39;s definitely something we&#39;ll=\r\n have to\n&gt; investigate when we next do a big crawl.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Another pos=\r\nsibility for you would be the nutch crawler.  Depends on what\n&gt; exactly you=\r\n want from the crawler.  Heritrix is very nice as a stand\nalone\n&gt; crawler u=\r\nsed for harvesting pages from the Internet.  From the\nlittle I&#39;ve\n&gt; seen, n=\r\nutch is pretty tightly integrated with the nutch indexing/search\n&gt; capabili=\r\nty, and designed more for continuous crawling.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; - leo\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:archive-=\r\ncrawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of hijbul_bd\n&gt; Sent: Friday, June 06, 20=\r\n08 8:27 AM\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [archive-crawle=\r\nr] Crawling 100 million pages\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear All\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to cra=\r\nwl 100 million pages with in a month for crawling \n&gt; research. As far i kno=\r\nw some research crawler(IRLbot(6 billion pages in \n&gt; 41 days), polybot(120 =\r\nmillions pages in 19 days)) can download huge \n&gt; pages in short amount of t=\r\nime wich is not open source. In 2005 \n&gt; according to some blog site Heritri=\r\nx can download about 20 miilion \n&gt; pages in a month. What is the speed of c=\r\nurrent Heritrix version and How \n&gt; can I speed up heritrix to download 100 =\r\nmillion or at least 50 million \n&gt; pages with in a month. Are there any ohte=\r\nr open source crawler which \n&gt; can do this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in Advance\n&gt; Hijbul=\r\n Alam\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
