I think that, to people that is not got used to work with\n&gt; JMX (as me), it would be important to add that the example code in\n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/hcc/apidocs/overview-summary.html should be\n&gt; executed with the option -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.\nThank you for that.  Seems like you don&#39;t need this if you are doing the \nmanagement remotely.  Thanks for pointing it out.  I&#39;ll add it to the doc.\n&gt;\n&gt; And finally, a question: can JBOSS&#39;s jndi service be downloaded and\n&gt; installed on its own, and not with the application server?\nI&#39;m not sure.  Running full JBOSS just to do a directory server is \nindeed over the top.  On the other hand, its a no brainer.  You just \nstart it up and it just works -- and it has a UI so you can see whats \ngoing on.  That said, there&#39;s a plethora of JNDI providers out there.  \nThe apache directory server looks kinda nice. I haven&#39;t tried it and \nagain, looks a bit more than you probably want.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
