Suggestions \n&gt; for how to escape?\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Also, any idea why changing the configuration takes a long time from\n&gt;&gt; the UI but when I change something via JMX it&#39;s instantaneous?  Does\n&gt;&gt; this imply &quot;re-read seeds on config&quot; doesn&#39;t happen when setting from\n&gt;&gt; JMX?\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; That seems like a promising explanation.  We have to work better on the \n&gt; separation of UI handling code from internal logic.  I just noticed that \n&gt; if job is running, a kickUpdate is sent if any edit to UI.  I&#39;ve made an \n&gt; issue to refactor so this logic is run whether UI or JMX edit.\n&gt;&gt; Any predictions on the 1.10 release date?  :)\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; Can you predict whats passed?

You can&#39;t add/remove modules (e.g. decide \n&gt;&gt;&gt; rules) nor add overrides via JMX but we intend to fix this in the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; release after the pending one.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You can add a new job based on a jar that includes an order and seeds \n&gt;&gt;&gt; (and possibly overrides).  You could do desired macro edits on an \n&gt;&gt;&gt; order.xml template and then post the bundle to a remote crawler to \n&gt;&gt;&gt; execute on (Micro changes could be done by changing attributes via JMX \n&gt;&gt;&gt; -- though again, you can&#39;t get at attributes in overrides).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; St.Ack\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
