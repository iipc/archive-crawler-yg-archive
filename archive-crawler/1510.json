I have\ntried on both cygwin and windows NT command prompt (but would prefer\nto use the latter).\n\nIn Windows, I saved heritrix inside a folder &#92;project and added\n&#92;project to the classfile. I set %HERITRIX_HOME% to the right place.\nBut now I have no idea of how to get it to run (typing java heritrix\nthrows Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.noClassDefFoundError:\nheritrix)\n\nIn Cygwin, I set %HERITRIX_HOME% and %JAVA_HOME% to the appropriate\nplaces, chmod&#39;ed, then tried to run. It said Starting heritrix... then\ncontinued to print out dots for over an hour. Is it meant to take this\nlong?\n\n\nIf anyone can help it would be really appreciated. Please note that I\nhave very little computer knowledge (I only got my first computer 2\nmonths ago), so don&#39;t assume I know how to do anything. Explain as if\nto a very small child - I promise not to feel patronised!\n\n\n\n\n"}}
