Brewster\nsuggested this would be an ideal way for remote clients of Archive\ncrawling services to specify, start, and check the progress of\ncrawls. Such an interface can even be helpful for local control\nof an otherwise &quot;headless&quot; (UI-free) process.\n\n--\nRE: 3.1.1.5 Document processing\n\nThe handling of duplicates should be done in a way that is amenable \nto use by standard post-crawl tools. \n\nOutputting crawl info in the ARC format is of paramount importance;\nwe don&#39;t need to implement other output formats ourselves, and we\nshouldn&#39;t encourage format proliferation (even if there are clean\nhooks for the determined to insert other formats). We should work\nto move the ARC format towards being a widely-recognized standard,\nimproving its specification (and possibly extending it) as necessary\nfor this goal. \n\n--\nRE: 3.2 high bandwidth\n\nIt was suggested that a goal of 10Mbps per machine is enough,\nrather than 15-30Mbps, so that 10 machines could saturate a\n100Mbps link. Further, a crawler &quot;farm&quot; size of 10-20 machines,\nrather than 5-10, should be our target.\n\nUPDATE: Reddy&#39;s Java IO throughput tests actually showed 2-6\nmega*bytes* per second, not mega*bits* per second, so we have\nin fact seen (in simple tests) throughput of 16-48Mbps. So\na target of 15-30Mbps in a system where other bottlenecks\nhave been removed may still be reasonable. \n\n--\nRE: 3.5 Portability\n\nAll of the initial users of the Crawler are content with using\nLinux machines -- so high performance on Windows is not a \nrequirement.\n\n(With good Windows Java environments, we may get suitable Windows\nperformance anyway, and this could be revisited if Microsoft \nfunding were to materialize, but for now, only high performance\non Linux is necessary.)\n\n--\nRE: 3.6 Ease of Operation\n\nIt was emphasized that real-world crawls require tweaking,\nbabysitting, and adjustment -- and thus that we need to set \nexpectations reasonably, not promising a &quot;fire-and-forget&quot;\ncapability. Also, for multi-machine crawls, a relatively\nsophisticated operator will always be necessary. \n\nLogging should support long-term confidence in the output\nof crawling activity -- providing an audit trail that begins\nto take into account the &quot;provenance&quot; concerns of careful\narchivists. However, such separate logs should never be necessary \nto usefully analyze crawl results: the ARCs should stand alone\nfor that purpose, as self-contained crawl records. \n\n--\nRE: 3.7 Open Licensing\n  \nThe &quot;Lesser (or Library) GPL&quot; (LGPL) meets our needs for the\nforseeable future, encouraging wide usage and a large contribution\ncommunity.\n\n--\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n\n"}}
