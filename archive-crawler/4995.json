If heritrix2 is stable in april or may 2008\nI think I&#39;ll use this newer version to get my stuff implemented\ninstead of using the 1.x - tree.\nIf I get priorization implemented in 1.x I&#39;ll share the code with you.\n\nChristian\n\n\n \n\nMathew Nik Foscarini schrieb:\n&gt; Hi Christian,\n&gt;\n&gt; With Heritrix 1.12 you can&#39;t give URI priorities, but you can give \n&gt; them prerequisites. This allows you to assign a URI to come before \n&gt; another URI. I think this is how it works, but I haven&#39;t looked much \n&gt; at that code, but it works more like a linked list then a ranking sort.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are right that in Heritrix 2.0 they now support rankings of URIs, \n&gt; but I haven&#39;t looked at that either.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would be interested in know if you get this implemented with 1.12, \n&gt; because that is a feature I&#39;d like to use as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----\n&gt; From: Christian Krumm &lt;signore.chrissi@...&gt;\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 19, 2008 6:09:44 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] Extracting title attribute and linktext \n&gt; of an HTML-anchor\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Mathew,\n&gt;\n&gt; I think you misunderstands me a bit. What I want to do is extracting \n&gt; features\n&gt; of a hyperlink, like the linktext or title-attribute.\n&gt; I don&#39;t mean the title of the HTML-Page here.\n&gt; Assumed we have an anchor like this:\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google. com &lt;http://www.google.com&gt;&quot; title=&quot;Google \n&gt; Homepage&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I wan&#39;t to extract the URL, the title &quot;Google Homepage&quot; and the \n&gt; Linktext &quot;Google&quot; so I can calculate a prediction how relevant a \n&gt; webpage is, before downloading it.\n&gt; I also need the possibility of priorisize or delay  extracted URI \n&gt; candidates, so relevant pages can be considered first (a.k.a Focused \n&gt; Crawling). In Heritrix 2.0 there exists an attribute precedence which \n&gt; should do the job implementing an own UriPrecedencePolicy , I think. \n&gt; But actually I don&#39;t really know it, because heritrix2 isn&#39;t released \n&gt; and neither a developer manual nor a documentation of the precedence \n&gt; feature exists.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a (similar) mechanism to priorize or delay URIs in Heritrix 1.x ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a lot for your help.\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings from Oldenburg (Oldb) / Germany\n&gt; Christian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; 2008/2/19, Mathew Nik Foscarini &lt;nfoscarini@yahoo. com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:nfoscarini@...&gt;&gt;:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Hi Christian,\n&gt;\n&gt;     The ExtractorHTML class is used to add URIs to the queue waiting\n&gt;     to be crawled. Since the title tag is not a valid URI it doesn&#39;t\n&gt;     help to extract that tag in a modified version of that class. You\n&gt;     could write your own writer class to store the title, and other\n&gt;     tags to a file or database for that URI.\n&gt;\n&gt;     You can extract the title tag using a regular expression.\n&gt;\n&gt;     &quot;(?i)(&lt;title&gt;.*?&lt;/title&gt;)&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;     As an example.\n&gt;\n&gt;     ----- Original Message ----\n&gt;     From: Christian Krumm &lt;signore.chrissi@ googlemail. com\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:signore.chrissi@...&gt;&gt;\n&gt;     To: archive-crawler@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;     Sent: Monday, February 18, 2008 3:18:32 PM\n&gt;     Subject: [archive-crawler] Extracting title attribute and linktext\n&gt;     of an HTML-anchor\n&gt;\n&gt;     Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;     for my diploma thesis I plan to implement a link prediction module\n&gt;     using\n&gt;     Heritrix.\n&gt;     For this task I would like to extract special attributes of an anchor\n&gt;     like title or linktext.\n&gt;     Is extraction of these features already implemented in Heritrix?\n&gt;     I can&#39;t actually find it in the current sourcecode of ExtractorHTML.\n&gt;\n&gt;     If I have to implement it on my own, I think it whould be good\n&gt;     practise\n&gt;     to write an own extractor,\n&gt;     and to use alist on the CrawlURI level to save the extracted\n&gt;     features.
