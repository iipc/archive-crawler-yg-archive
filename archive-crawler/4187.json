(A queue snoozing for a few seconds at a time and still \nleaving successes in the crawl log is just being polite; a queue \nsnoozing for minutes at a time and only leaving connect-errors in the \nlocal-errors.log is hopelessly retrying an unresponsive web server.)\n\nNo evidence of a problem here, just the usual &#39;tailing off&#39; of activity \nwhen only the large, slow, and dead hosts still have URIs left to crawl. \nThe URIs left may also be trap/spam/junk/redundant material of \nnegligible value, so based on your analysis of their value to you it may \njust be time to end the crawl.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nvretr wrote:\n&gt; hi.\n&gt; \n&gt;   I check my frontier report.   \n&gt; ---\n&gt; Frontier report - 200704260026\n&gt;  Job being crawled: 2_8_domain002_test1\n&gt; \n&gt;  -----===== STATS =====-----\n&gt;  Discovered:    17546518\n&gt;  Queued:        11781711\n&gt;  Finished:      5767588\n&gt;   Successfully: 5614726\n&gt;   Failed:       147786\n&gt;   Disregarded:  5076\n&gt; \n&gt;  -----===== QUEUES =====-----\n&gt;  Already included size:     17546518\n&gt;                pending:     0\n&gt; \n&gt;  All class queues map size: 6456\n&gt;              Active queues: 12\n&gt;                     In-process: 0\n&gt;                          Ready: 0\n&gt;                        Snoozed: 12\n&gt;            Inactive queues: 0\n&gt;             Retired queues: 0\n&gt;           Exhausted queues: 6444\n&gt; ----------------\n&gt;     but what do, slove this question.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Magin &lt;magin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Take a look at your frontier report early in crawling and then later in \n&gt;&gt; the crawl.  I expect that you will probably find that late in the crawl \n&gt;&gt; there are relatively few active queues -- All the hosts which had \n&gt;&gt; relatively few URIs to crawl were exhausted earlier in the crawl -- now \n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re seeing the small number of hosts which have a large number of \n&gt;&gt; documents.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (In some cases, this could be crawler traps, such as hosts which \n&gt;&gt; generate an infinite number of URLs, either through session ID \n&gt;&gt; parameters or other dynamically generated content, such as calendars.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mike\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; vretr wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; hi,all.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; During the late period of crawling, the crawling data increases\n&gt;&gt;&gt; slowly, and the speed is usually lower than 5kb/sec, and few of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ToeThread is in active state.
