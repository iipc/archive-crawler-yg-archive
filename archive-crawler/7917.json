That said, you may want to implement a DecideRule if you have a custom way to shape the scope of a crawl, or a ContentExtractor if you have a custom way to discover URLs from resources.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think, though, that you&#39;re probably more interested in what to do with the web data in the warc files after the crawl is complete.\n&gt; \n&gt; Travis\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, 15 Jan 2013 09:58:22 -0800 (PST)\n&gt; Ali Pesaranghader alipsgh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi friends,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m new in working with Heritrix. I need some help and somebody guides me with some helpful suggestions about implementing my crawlers based on some algorithms such is TD-IDF, Shark Search, Fish Search and etc. I know how algorithms work theoretically (on paper), but I want to build them as a real crawler to gather pages in the Web (from seed pages) and filter them and retrieved most related pages to a query.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I will be thankful if you share your ideas with me about this.\n&gt; &gt; Respectfully,\n&gt; &gt; Ali\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n\n"}}
