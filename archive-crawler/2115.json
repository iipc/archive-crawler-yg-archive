At leas I could not find any\n&gt; code in head that would indicate the spider uses one\n&gt; of those.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This is a problem for me, because I want to do incremental\n&gt; updates of spider runs. To do such an update there is no\n&gt; need to fetch a page that has already been fetched.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nor does it use HTTP/1/1 ETag \n&gt;   http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I missing something here??\n\nNo. You are not missing anything. We don&#39;t do HTTP 1.1 nor do we have \nprocessors that look at if-modified-since or Etags.\n\nOn HTTP 1.1, your not the first to ask about it. In the past people have \nusually been interested in the keep-alive feature of HTTP/1.1 (See the \n&#39;[896805] Consider use of HTTP/1.1 & kept-alive sockets&#39; \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102&func=detail&aid=896805).  \n\n\nFor us here at the Archive, we wouldn&#39;t consider use of HTTP/1.1 until \nafter we&#39;d done work experimenting to see differences in server \nresponses and after ensuring that downstream, the downloaded content \ndoesn&#39;t make our postprocessing tools choke. This would be a significant \nundertaking.  It hasn&#39;t been a priority to date.\n\nBut that said, we&#39;d be very much interested in a patch that optionally \nenabled HTTP/1.1 in the crawler and would like to hear about people&#39;s \nexperiences crawling with 1.1 (We&#39;ve  received a contribution to this \nend In the past from friends-of-Heritrix who needed HTTP/1.1 so Heritrix \ncould pass NTLM authentication challenges but it was in need of work. If \nwanted, I could post the patch to the list given the author&#39;s \npermission).  For your usage scenario, since you don&#39;t need keep-alive, \nyou might be able to get away with a small change making the crawler \nvolunteer itself as HTTP/1.1 passing a &#39;Connection: close&#39; header in \nwith each request.\n\nOn Etags and dates, checkout this interesting paper by our Danish \ncomrades: http://netarchive.dk/website/publications/Etags-2004.pdf.  \nHere is a quote from the paper: &quot;Not all servers send out Etags or even \ndatestamps. Of the pages downloaded, only 3,321,598 (59.9%) had Etags. \nDatestamps are much more common, with 5,539,430 pages (99.93%) having a \ndatestamp. Both indicators are fairly reliable, missing less than 1% of \nchanged pages, the Etag missing less than 0.1%. They are somewhat \nconservative, and predict changes in up to one-third of pages that have \nnot changed...&quot;\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\nP.S. Apologize for not responding earlier to your note to the list of \n08/08/05, &quot;[archive-crawler] Why is FetchHTTP using HTTP/1.0 and not \nHTTP/1.1?&quot;\nP.P.S I don&#39;t know of another crawler that does HTTP/1.1 but perhaps \nother on the lists know of such a beastie.\nP.P.P.S The guidelines you cite, interestingly, are from 1993.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
