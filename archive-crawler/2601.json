I&#39;ve seen in this forum talking about the maximum \n&gt; heap being 2GB on 32-bit JVM. I&#39;m not sure if you guys are using an \n&gt; older kernel that is just not capable of allocating 3GB memory from \n&gt; the beginning or someone really tried it and it does not work well. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway here is my machine spec. \n&gt; \n&gt; [acc@i04 crawler_control]$ /lib/libc.so.6\n&gt; GNU C Library stable release version 2.3.4, by Roland McGrath et al.\n&gt; Copyright (C) 2005 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n&gt; This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.\n&gt; There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A\n&gt; PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n&gt; Compiled by GNU CC version 3.4.4 20050721 (Red Hat 3.4.4-2).\n&gt; Compiled on a Linux 2.4.20 system on 2005-10-08.\n&gt; Available extensions:\n&gt; GNU libio by Per Bothner\n&gt; crypt add-on version 2.1 by Michael Glad and others\n&gt; linuxthreads-0.10 by Xavier Leroy\n&gt; The C stubs add-on version 2.1.2.\n&gt; BIND-8.2.3-T5B\n&gt; NIS(YP)/NIS+ NSS modules 0.19 by Thorsten Kukuk\n&gt; Glibc-2.0 compatibility add-on by Cristian Gafton\n&gt; GNU Libidn by Simon Josefsson\n&gt; libthread_db work sponsored by Alpha Processor Inc\n&gt; Thread-local storage support included.\n&gt; For bug reporting instructions, please see:\n&gt; &lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/bugs.html&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; [acc@i04 crawler_control]$ uname -a\n&gt; Linux i04.ba.accelovation.com 2.6.9-22.0.1.106.unsupportedsmp #1 SMP\n&gt; Sun Nov 6 09:55:19 CST 2005 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n&gt; \n&gt; [acc@i04 crawler_control]$ grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo\n&gt; MemTotal: 4046212 kB\n&gt; \n&gt; [acc@i04 crawler_control]$ grep -e &quot;model\n&gt; name&#92;|cache&#92;|MHz&quot; /proc/cpuinfo\n&gt; model name : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz\n&gt; cpu MHz : 2992.627\n&gt; cache size : 1024 KB\n&gt; cache_alignment : 128\n&gt; model name : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz\n&gt; cpu MHz : 2992.627\n&gt; cache size : 1024 KB\n&gt; cache_alignment : 128\n&gt; \n&gt; [acc@i04 crawler_control]$ ./crawler_memory.sh\n&gt; Heap Memory Usage:\n&gt; ==================\n&gt; 01/25/2006 15:33:05 -0800 org.archive.jmx.Client HeapMemoryUsage:\n&gt; committed: 2292801536\n&gt; init: 0\n&gt; max: 3121545216\n&gt; used: 1876355104\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
