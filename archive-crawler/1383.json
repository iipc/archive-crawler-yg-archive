Performance metrics -- I&#39;ve looked through the Heretrix site and\n&gt; the performance information is not clear to me.  Does anyone have\n&gt; metrics that they can share?\n\nWhat metrics are you looking for?  Heritrix performance varies wildly \nwith the settings used, where Heritrix is in the crawl lifecycle,  JVM, \nquality of your connection to the net,  what you are crawling, and \nprofile of the Hardware its deployed on.  \n\nThis morning a partner from Iceland reported Heritrix, after running for \n4 days, doing a HostScoped crawl against 11k hosts, steadily pulling at \na rate of ~15docs or 857k a second on a fairly decent machine (I don&#39;t \nhave its exact stats other than JVM was using 1.2gigs of RAM).  We \nourselves are running comparable crawls on sets of slow machines (999mhz \nand 512k RAM with JVM using 300k) with each machine settled after a few \ndays running at a rate of ~5docs a second.  Other crawls we&#39;ve run on \n&#39;better&#39; hardware -- fast dual processors with loads of RAM -- have \nsustained periods pulling 30-40 docs a second with intervals of 50-70 \ndocs a second near the start of a crawl. \n\nIt all depends.\n\n&gt; 2.  A list of organizations (besides the Archive) using Heretrix with\n&gt; descriptions of the scale of their usage.\n\nYou might go back through the archives.  In a few instances people have \nvolunteered what they are using Heritrix for.\n\n(If wanted, I can start a page that lists uses of Heritrix.  Send me a \none sentence summary and a link to the Heritrix project if a public link \nexists and I&#39;ll add it to a public list).\n\nHere&#39;s a sampling of what we&#39;ve used Heritrix for here at the Archive \n(Numbers and descriptions of machines are coarse):\n+ Crawl of the .fr domain. About a month of crawling divided between 4-8 \nmachines using a mix of the 999mhz machines descibed above and another, \nfaster 1.7ghz machine.  This crawl pulled down ~50-60million documents.\n+ Crawl of all government sites for NARA to coincide with the &#39;change&#39; \nin administration.  This crawl lasted 4 to 5 weeks and pulled down \n~75million documents (6.5Tb) with the crawl split across 4-5 1.7ghz \nmachines.\n- Crawl of sites that pertain to the Iraq war on a weekly basis.  One \n1.7ghz machine pulling down about 300gigs a week.\n- Crawl of a small set of UK government sites on a weekly and 6-monthly \nbasis.\n- Monthly congressional crawl.\n- Crawl of sites related to Indian Ocean Tsumami\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
