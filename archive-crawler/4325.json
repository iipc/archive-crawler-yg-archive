That was \natrociously inefficient and very slow for large seed lists.\n\nThe SURT-based scopes (deprected SurtPrefixedScope and recommended \nSurtPrefixedDecideRule) use sorted lists of acceptable SURT-form URI \nprefixes. A candidate URI is compared against the prefix immediately \npreceding it in sorted order; if the prefix matches the URI is ruled in. \nMuch faster, in practice.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nJigar Patel wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Please anyone tell me hwo SURTScope works internally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually previously I was using HostScope and I implemented same thing \n&gt; using SURTScope and I got improvement in speed...\n&gt; \n&gt; Please anyone tell me how does it work internally....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance...\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jigar Patel\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
