The approach taken in the robustify.js sta=\r\ntuscode.php script seems to work pretty well (but to test it well I need a =\r\nset of soft-404s and that would require some good soft-404 detection, a typ=\r\nical chicken - egg situation).\n\nIt would be beneficial to detect soft-404s =\r\nbecause:\n- essential they are 404s so knowing soft-404s helps to quantify a=\r\nnd understand the web\n- knowing soft 404s can help improve functionality of=\r\n search indexes\n- soft-404s might be the source of crawler traps, so we pro=\r\nbably will not want to use them to detect new urls\n- in some cases we might=\r\n not even want to store soft 404s, which helps keeping the archive smaller\n=\r\n- ...\n\nHaving soft-404 detection will pose some questions.
