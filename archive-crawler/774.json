The extractors \n&gt;would be the refactored guts of current extractors stripped of the \n&gt;crawler context (i.e. no reference to CrawlURIs, etc.  The crawler \n&gt;context references would be in wrappers, just as the ARCWriterProcessor \n&gt;wraps ARCWriter now).  Per extractor, the subclass of ARCReader would \n&gt;reget the ARCRecord till all were done (Or, if more than one, it might \n&gt;pay to add caching if small or use the subclass our netarchive.dk \n&gt;colleagues have been talking of).\n&gt;* Pro: Easier delivery\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe awkward aspect of the above approach will be the code to handle \nconversion from byte stream to character stream (Parsing of HTTP headers \nif present to find content-type to get out encoding, etc).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
