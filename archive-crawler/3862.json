On my system (8GB memory, 1GB allocated to the heap) I\n&gt; have checkpointing running every twenty four hours and it crashed\n&gt; after only a few days. \n\nIt would be useful to see the lines of heritrix_out.log and \nprogress_statistics.log before the point where the error occurred.\nHow large is this crawl?  Are you using BloomUriUniqFilter?\n\n&gt; The checkpointing as far as I know is only\n&gt; rolling over the logs, not writing the (jdb?) files. \n\nWhat is your checkpoint-copy-bdbje-logs parameter (near the end of \norder.xml) set to?  If it is set to true, relevant jdb files are copied \nto the checkpoint directory.  If it is set to false, section 9.4.1 of \nthe user manual \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#checkpoint explains \nwhat you have.\n\nMike\n\n"}}
