As a file\nsuffix &quot;.au&quot; is usually used for audio files, which I do not want to\ninclude in my text-only crawls.\n\n&gt; Once I understand more about Heritrix, I would be happy to help out with\n&gt; the project of integrating BootCat-like seeding methods into it.\n\nCool --- we can talk about that offline and then come back to the list\nlater if things work out.\n\n&gt; (Right now, I seem to have out of memory problems, having tried a broad \n&gt; scope crawl... still a lot to learn! ;-) )\n\nYes, broad scope is a huge memory hog. Work is going on right now to\nuse different methods for storing the discovered URLs. Until then I&#39;d\navoid using broad scope.\n\nFor my Traditional Chinese crawl we manually collected around 100 URLs\nand are using a host scope to limit the spread. One problem that I&#39;ve\nrun into doing these data crawls in the past has been contamination\nfrom external links to adverts and the like. Limiting to the hosts in\nthe seed list help with this. Unfortunately 100 seeds isn&#39;t really\nenough: my current crawl has been running for 502 hours and is only\n55% complete with 3 queues ... I&#39;ll probably kill it eventually, but\nfor now I continue to let it run since I don&#39;t need to crawl anything\nelse right now.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
