The Spring-originated XML configuration\nmetadata format is now our format for describing crawls, as well.\n\nThe web-based user-interface in Heritrix 3 has been streamlined and\nupdated to have consistent URLs and simple forms for most actions,\nincluding viewing and editing job files or running arbitrary script code\nwithin the context of a job. Programmatic operations against the web\ninterface have replaced JMX as the preferred manner to remote-control\nHeritrix.\n\nAlso, Heritrix 3 moves to a model where a single job, in a single job\ndirectory, may be be relaunched in place many times (instead of creating\na new job directory before each launch).\n\n== Limitations ==\n\nThe most significant limitation compared to earlier versions of Heritrix\nis that crawl configuration requires editing an XML configuration file,\neither on disk or via the web UI&#39;s large-textarea raw file editor. A\nguided, form-of-many-fields crawl configuration editor is not expected\nuntil some time after the 3.0.0 release.\n\nThis Release Candidate is considered feature-complete, but work\ncontinues on known bugs and packaging/interface/documentation issues\nbefore a final release in early December. The prioritized list of issues\nto be addressed for the 3.0.0 final release, and subsequent releases, is\nviewable in the project issue tracker &#39;Road Map&#39;:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel\n\n== Downloads ==\n\nDistribution packages (.tar.gz or .zip) may be downloaded directly from\nour Maven2 repository:\n\nhttp://builds.archive.org:8080/maven2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/3.0.0-RC1/\n\nAs always, problem reports, ideas, fix/feature contributions, and other\nkinds of feedback are all welcome here on the list and on the project\nwiki and JIRA issue tracker:\n\nHeritrix Wiki: http://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix\nHeritrix JIRA: http://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER\n\nThanks!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n"}}
