It works fine with Windows\n&gt; XP\n&gt; &gt; (with/without Service Pack 1) but NOT with Service\n&gt; &gt; Pack 2. We tried it with two different computers\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; SP 2 installed and got the same result in both\n&gt; cases.\n&gt; &gt; Now my question is: Has anybody been able to use a\n&gt; &gt; version of Heritrix successfully with Windows XP\n&gt; &gt; Service Pack 2?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you be more specific about how it doesn&#39;t work?\n&gt; \n&gt; Does it not launch? Launch but crash? Launch and run\n&gt; but not make expected progress? Etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do other Java apps work with the same VM?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \nFirst of all thanks for the answers! The problem is\nthat it&#39;s not my machine we have troubles with it&#39;s my\nfriends computer and he&#39;s living about 2 1/2 hrs away\nfrom me, so i dunno what the problem is exactly. Next\nweek i&#39;m going to see the prof, who assigned this\nproject to us and he&#39;s having the same strange\ntroubles with heritrix. Both guys aren&#39;t very well\nversed with heritrix as it was my task to integrate\nHeritrix into our project. Strange thing is tho, that\nit works WITHOUT any problems on my machine (i have SP\n1 installed) and my uncle&#39;s (he has no SP installed at\nall) so it was my guess that there might be a problem\nwith SP2 but next thursday (hopefully) i&#39;ll know more!\n\nRegards,\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
