Using it, you&#39;ll be subject to brand new\nbugs -- up to and including things that render the crawler\ninoperative until fixed.\n\nIf you use CVS HEAD, it can also be good to keep an eye on the\n&#39;archive-crawler-cvs&#39; CVS commits mailing list -- so you see some\nindication of big changes and latest fixes:\n\n   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=34924\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
