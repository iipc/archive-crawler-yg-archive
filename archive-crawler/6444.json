Since html won&#39;t be crawled, css referred to in the uncrawled html will not be discovered.\n\nNoah\n\n\nDEEPA R wrote:\n&gt; Hi, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to narrow my crawl by allowing only css types of files to be accepted. For this I am using the &quot;NotMatchesFilePatternDecideRule&quot; with the properties like :\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;bean class=&quot;org.archive.modules.deciderules.NotMatchesFilePatternDecideRule&quot;&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;property name=&quot;decision&quot; value=&quot;REJECT&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;property name=&quot;regex&quot; value=&quot;.*(/|&#92;.css)$&quot; /&gt; \n&gt;  &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; with the other rules in this order , as on the manual :\n&gt; \n&gt;    1. RejectDecideRule\n&gt;    2. SurtPrefixedDecideRule\n&gt;    3. TooManyHopsDecideRule\n&gt;    4. PathologicalPathDecideRule\n&gt;    5. TooManyPathSegmentsDecideRule\n&gt;    6. NotMatchesFilePatternDecideRule\n&gt;    7. PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule\n&gt; \n&gt; But I am getting all types of files like pdf , images and not getting the css files . I am not able to figure out where am I going wrong. Any help is greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;     \n\n"}}
