However, those URIs will be treated the same as other seed or \ndiscovered URIs. So, discovered outlinks from those URIs will be \nfollowed (or not) according to the scope rules.\n\nSome of the formats you can use in the ActionDirectory allow you to \nspecify new URIs in what is essentially the &#39;recovery log&#39; format -- and \nthus include your own versions of the &#39;hopsPath&#39; (the string of letters \ndescribing the types of links that have been followed) and &#39;viaUri&#39; \n(source URI from which the current URI was discovered).\n\nIf you were trying to hack together something to acheive the effect you \ndescribe, that might prove useful. For example, if your scope has a \nmaxHopsDecideRule with a threshold of 20 hops, you could give your \n&#39;exact URLs&#39; fake hopsPaths of &#39;LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL&#39; (20 navlink hops). \nThus, any new &#39;L&#39; links out of that page would be over the threshold, \nand not enqueued. (Other embedded &#39;transcluded&#39; images, resources, etc. \nwould be retrieved, or not, according to your other settings.)\n\nYou could possibly even put a totally fake value into hopsPath -- it&#39;s \njust a string and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s validated in current code to only \ndraw from the usual LEXRP tokens -- and then write your own DecideRule \n(in Java or via ScriptedDecideRule) that treats outlinks starting from \nyour custom plug value differently.\n\n(I&#39;m not a fan of that approach aesthetically, but it should work. It \ndoes suggest another more general feature, URIs which carry with them \nand pass along a &#39;personality&#39; token which allows them to be treated \ndifferently, just as overlay settings can be different for different \nsites/URI patterns. Some future version might have that feature to \nbetter allow mixing many different crawl purposes in a single &#39;job&#39;.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/19/10 6:30 PM, 郭芸 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all，\n&gt; I want to kown how add specific urls to heritrix when it&#39;s runing? the\n&gt; urls I want to add are not seeds, cause I only want heritrix to crawl\n&gt; these exact urls but don&#39;t extract new urls from these pages.\n&gt; and I use Heritrix3.0\n&gt; 2010-12-20\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; 郭芸\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
