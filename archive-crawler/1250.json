Basically,\nwhen you&#39;re running a crawl, does a person generally monitor it, to\nwatch for it getting stuck on a site (calendars, etc) and make\nadjustments, or do you have some kind of app that monitors it and\nnotifies someone?\n\nI was just running a single site crawl to try some things with\nsettings and ended up having to add some filtering for it because it\nhad a forum message board and a calendar that was going to go on and\non.  This kind of thing would be hard to anticipate in advance (I\nthink) because sites are going to name pages different, implement\nthings different (php, html, etc.).\n\nRob\nAptas, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
