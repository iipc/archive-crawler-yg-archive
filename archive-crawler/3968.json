So far I only found examples on launching heritrix using shell \nscrip=\r\nts and as webapp/servlet.  \nBasically i want to use heritrix as the core cr=\r\nawling &#39;engine&#39; so to \nspeak, and stick in my own extractors, filters and w=\r\nriters. And if \npossible I&#39;d like to avoid the need to read/write order.xml=\r\n, etc. In \nother words, I want to set the crawler settings via method calls=\r\n \ndirectly during runtime, etc. What is the proper way to do it? \nThanks in=\r\n advanced for any suggestions.\nPhil\n\n\n"}}
