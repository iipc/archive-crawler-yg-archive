The very latest=\r\n H3 development \n&gt; builds are available from the new Jenkins-based build bo=\r\nx, accessible \n&gt; for now at:\n&gt; \n&gt; https://ia410225.us.archive.org:1443/\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Generally if you would have been comfortable with the 3.1.0-beta a \n&gt; 3.1=\r\n.0-SNAPSHOT would be appropriate too (and we always appreciate the \n&gt; help =\r\ntesting the latest code in preparation for an official release).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is =\r\nthis the last version available? With subversion I downloaded heritrix3, is=\r\n it older than heritrix 1.14.4?\n&gt; &gt; Why are two numbering sequences being u=\r\nsed? I mean &quot;heritrix 1, 2, 3&quot; and then also &quot;heritrix 1.14.3, 1.14.4....&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Roughly changes to the leading digit (eg &quot;1.&quot;, &quot;2.&quot;, &quot;3.&quot; aka &quot;major \n=\r\n&gt; version&quot;) mean there are big, backward incompatible changes that users \n&gt;=\r\n of previous editions will want to understand before upgrading. Changes \n&gt; =\r\nto the second digit (eg &quot;1.12&quot;, &quot;1.14&quot;, &quot;3.0&quot;, &quot;3.1&quot; aka &quot;minor \n&gt; version&quot;=\r\n) indicate some new functionality but generally painless \n&gt; transitions for=\r\nward if you familiarize yourself with the Release Notes \n&gt; for the releases=\r\n between what you&#39;re using and what you&#39;re moving to. \n&gt; Changes to the thi=\r\nrd digit (eg &quot;1.14.1&quot;, &quot;1.14.2&quot;, &quot;1.14.3&quot; aka &quot;micro&quot; \n&gt; or &quot;patch&quot; or &quot;poi=\r\nnt release&quot;) mean mostly fixes and small changes, and \n&gt; often (but unfortu=\r\nnately not always) configurations can be brought \n&gt; forward with no conscio=\r\nus effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even as later major versions are developed, some people can=\r\n&#39;t move right \n&gt; away, so small fix point releases will continue on the ear=\r\nlier major \n&gt; version. (Heritrix 2 went through a second major configuratio=\r\nn change \n&gt; after its first release, but before any widespread adoption, so=\r\n \n&gt; essentially everyone using Heritrix should be on either 1.14.x or 3.0+ =\r\n\n&gt; and no other H2 point releases are expected.) Our expected next few \n&gt; o=\r\nfficial releases are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.1.0 final\n&gt; 1.14.5\n&gt; 3.1.1\n&gt; \n&gt; There will pro=\r\nbably eventually be a 1.14.6 if institutions keep using it \n&gt; and there are=\r\n necessary fixes that accumulate, but there probably won&#39;t \n&gt; be a 1.16.0.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, people starting fresh who can handle XML-based \n&gt; confi=\r\nguration editing, or people doing their own code customizations in \n&gt; Java,=\r\n are urged to start with a Heritrix 3 release. People on projects \n&gt; that a=\r\nlready have experience with Heritrix 1 and are used-to or more \n&gt; comfortab=\r\nle with its form-fields-based configuration can wait until they \n&gt; feel the=\r\ny need something in H3.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am going crazy with the gzip problem: I=\r\n cannot get nutchwax to import any arc produced by heritrix. Is this gzip p=\r\nroblem solved in 3.1.0? I am using jdk1.6.0_25\n&gt; \n&gt; The latest dev builds (=\r\nincluding 3.1.0-beta and the 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT \n&gt; builds on the new build mach=\r\nine referenced above) have a workaround for \n&gt; the GZIP-reading issues intr=\r\noduced by JDK6u23-and-above. If you can get \n&gt; your nutchwax version to use=\r\n the latest (W)ARC-reading code, which may \n&gt; take a little work, it should=\r\n resolve your issues. Or, you could go back \n&gt; to JDK6u22 or earlier.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanx in advance to anyone who m=\r\night help.\n&gt; &gt; Nacho\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
