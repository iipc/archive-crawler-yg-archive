Last week was so busy. \n\nI was looking for a stray character on all =\r\nof the override segments\nand I didn&#39;t find any. The filters are correct bec=\r\nause when I try to\ncrawl a domain, I create a simple job (without overrides=\r\n) and the\nfilters do work. When I create a job with more than one domain, a=\r\nnd\ncreate a override for each domain, the same filters (from the simple\njob=\r\n) are applied on the specific override. In this case they (filters)\ndon&#39;t w=\r\nork.\n\nI&#39;m actually using Host scope, and these filters are created as a\nExc=\r\nlude-Filter. The URI&#39;s that I want to accept, are expressed as a\nregular ex=\r\npression and the return value is FALSE. The URI&#39;s that I\ndon&#39;t want to acce=\r\npt are also expressed as a regular expression but\nthe return value is TRUE.=\r\n\n\nOnce more, thanks you in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
