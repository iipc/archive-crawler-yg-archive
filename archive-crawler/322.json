I somehow think a running series \nnumber in an archive implies that no two files in an archive have \nidentical s-numbers (even if their timestamps differ)\n\nS-number makes file names more unique but it&#39;s not very informative. \nWould it be possible to use job name instead \n\nOperatorGivenName - Jobname - Timestamp - IP.arc.gz for example =&gt;\n\nfinland - photoarchives - timestamp - IP.arc.gz\n\nSlight problem of course that job names have variable lengths unlike \ns-numbers.\n\nkaisa\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@a...&gt; \nwrote:\n \n&gt; An explanation:\n&gt; \n&gt; For long-term inventory purposes, it is important ARCs\n&gt; have names that are descriptive and highly likely to be\n&gt; unique, and that they feature a header explaining the\n&gt; software that was used and ideally the &#39;crawl&#39;/purpose\n&gt; that drove their collection. Current conventions don&#39;t\n&gt; always meet this need, though it&#39;s possible, within the\n&gt; existing formats.\n&gt; \n&gt; NAMES:\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently, Heritrix ARC names are of the form:\n&gt; \n&gt; [operator-given-name][12-digit-timestamp]-[series#].arc.gz\n&gt; \n&gt; We plan to change them to:\n&gt; \n&gt; [operator-given-name]-[series#-padded-to-5-digits]-[12-digit-\ntimestamp]-[Base32-of-crawler-IP].arc.gz\n&gt; \n&gt; By moving the series nmber before the timestamp, it is\n&gt; easier for people to work with shell-completion to\n&gt; enter a specific filename. But padding the series# to 5\n&gt; digits, sort order is preserved even when series\n&gt; numbers gain significant digits, up to 100,000 items\n&gt; (10TB at 100MB/arc).\n&gt; \n&gt; By adding the crawl machine IP at the end uniqueness is\n&gt; nearly guaranteed. By representing the IP in Base32 the\n&gt; machine name will be much like a radio callsign -- more\n&gt; compact than dotted-decimal or hex, more memorable than\n&gt; 32-bit decimal number. IP is preferred to machine name\n&gt; as DNS info is more volatile and manipulable.\n&gt; \n&gt; An ARC name under the new system might look like:\n&gt; \n&gt;    CONGRESS-00007-20040420133907-FG71E2B.arc.gz\n\n\n\n"}}
