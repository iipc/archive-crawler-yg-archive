I&#39;m\nrunning into problems getting the correct escaping for the regular\nexpression even after looking at examples in the manual and mailing\nlist. I&#39;m trying to come up with all the characters that need escaping\nbefore they can go into this section of the order.xml. It seems like\nthere&#39;s 2 types of escaping needed, one to go from the URI to the Java\nregular expression, and the other to make it XML-compatible.\n\nThe special characters for XML are &lt; &gt; & &#39; &quot;\nI think that only the & can occur in a URI so I tried converting the &\nin the URIs to &amp; for the XML but then the pattern doesn&#39;t match a\nURI with just & instead of &amp;\nI experimented with using\n&lt;string&gt;&lt;![CDATA[uri-with-nonescaped-special-xml-chars]]&gt;&lt;/string&gt;\nto get around doing any conversion for the XML. I&#39;m not sure it that\nworked or not, I need to test it again.\n\nThe characters in the URI that need to be escaped for the Java regular\nexpression are at least . and ?\nI&#39;m not sure if the / character needs to be escaped.\n\nIs anyone doing something similar or have a better grasp on all the\ncharacters that need to be converted when going from URI -&gt; Java\nRegular expression -&gt; XML?\n\nthanks,\nAndrea\n\n"}}
