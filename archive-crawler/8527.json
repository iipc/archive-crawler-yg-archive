Then, make Heritrix simulate \nthe same effect, by manually setting the same cookie, or adding the \nresolution-specific entry URL as an extra seed. That *might* be enough \nfor further outlink URL-visits to also receive good content.\n\nOn the other hand, if the resolution-detecting Javascript controls page \ndisplay via repeated &quot;AJAX&quot; loads, or checks again on each followup \npage, the site may be hard or impossible to collect without true \nin-crawler Javascript execution (which Heritrix does not do).\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 5/27/14, 11:16 AM, Noah Levitt nlevitt@... [archive-crawler] \nwrote:\n&gt; Hello Stephanie,\n&gt;\n&gt; It looks like a web page has to execute some javascript in order to\n&gt; determine the screen resolution. There is no way to do that within\n&gt; heritrix.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, that shouldn&#39;t necessarily be an impediment to successful\n&gt; capture and replay. For example,\n&gt; http://web.archive.org/web/20140404155044/http://www.whatismyscreenresolution.com/\n&gt; works for me. The solution to the problem you&#39;re facing, if any, will\n&gt; depend on other technical details of what&#39;s happening.\n&gt;\n&gt; Noah\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, May 26, 2014 at 5:20 AM, Steph sherlock.h221b@...\n&gt; [archive-crawler] &lt;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The website I want to crawl detects the resolution using JavaScript and only\n&gt;&gt; grants access if you use a specific resolution.
