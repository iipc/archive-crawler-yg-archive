A series of gzipped chunks concatenated together is itself a valid gzipped file. Perhaps the C# GZipStream doesn&#39;t realize that. I would try reading through the [w]arc iteratively by opening a new GZipStream at the offset where the last one left off.\n\nNoah\n\n\nnfoscarini wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to read a compressed archive with C# and not having any luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried to use the GZipStream, but it stops after reading in the first 10 lines of the header for the archive. It uncompressed that part successfully but reports an end of stream once it&#39;s done the header.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems that Heritrix is writing archive files by appending gzip chunks to the end of the archive. This is causing me problems because GZipStream stops after reading the first chunk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have any idea on how I can get this to work?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
