I can&#39;t seem to get Heritrix to follow\n&gt; through the links in the flash though.  It stops after crawling the\n&gt; opening page, and won&#39;t download the swf file.  There is no\n&gt; robots.txt, so it&#39;s not a restriction set there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rob Eger\n&gt; Local Matters, Inc.\n\n\n\n"}}
