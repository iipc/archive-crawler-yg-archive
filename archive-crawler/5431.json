Check on it \nin the morning.\n\nSo now, this fine crawler is crawling away, and has been all day.\nIt reports itself as paused, and doesn&#39;t log anything to the \nprogress-statistics.log.\nHowever, crawl.log continues to grow just fine, as do downloaded arcs.\n\nAnd the last humor filled thing is that recover.gz seems to march right \nin step.\n\nNot sure if I managed to activate some in progress feature, of creating \na continuous\nrecover log, or what the eventual state will be.   But I&#39;ll leave it up, \nand see what happens.\nNot to mention,  I want the crawl data, and its best to not annoy people \nby too often,\nrecrawling their site.\n\nJohn\n\n\n"}}
