If so, please, explain or provide documentation  \n&gt; on how to implement.  If not, when or is it going to be an added  \n&gt; feature?\n&gt;\nSome features of hcc are already available in Heritrix 2.0; it can  \nremotely create, configure, launch and monitor crawls via JMX. We are  \nworking with an outside partner to fully document the 2.0 JMX  \ninterface; that documentation project should be done by the end of  \nJanuary.\n\nBut the Heritrix 2.0 engine does not keep an internal list of  \navailable crawlers, and so cannot automatically select a non-busy  \ncrawler to launch a new job in. I believe this is the only hcc  \nfeature missing from the engine, though I haven&#39;t done a thorough  \nanalysis.\n\nWe do plan to support hcc or hcc-like features in 2.0, but wanted to  \nrelease the crawler/webui first. We have no timeframe for hcc  \nfeatures yet, as we are trying to prioritize other 2.0-related work  \ntoo (documentation, testing, 1.x conversion tools, and so on). We&#39;ll  \nlet you know as soon as we have it all figured out.\n\n-Paul\n\n\n\n"}}
