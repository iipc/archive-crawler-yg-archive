Any ways I will try to\nhe=\r\nlp you as much as i can. Actualy what you need is an automated crawl\nthat y=\r\nou want to run with out UI , you want to run it from the\nbackground. My sug=\r\ngession will be do the procedure like this and see\nthe result\n\n1. start her=\r\nitrix from command line using command \n   (..path)/heritrix/bin heritrix --=\r\nadmin=3Dletmein:letmein\n\n2. start the Job\n   (..path)/heritrix/bin heritrix=\r\n (path of Order.xml)/order.xml\n\nBy this way to can start crawling the given=\r\n URLs\nTo do it on an automated basis try the following\n\n1. Create a shell s=\r\ncrip which calls the start method\n   (..path)/heritrix/bin heritrix (path o=\r\nf Order.xml)/order.xml\n   with your logic&#39;s like if the job is completed li=\r\nke that\n\n2. Create a cronjob which you will be able to create where you can=\r\n set\nlike run this shell script every 3 hours, every day,every hour  like t=\r\nhat.\n\n3. Add this cron job to like\n    type crontab -e\n    which will open =\r\na file\n    enter the cron job in that file\n    save that file using keys  e=\r\nsc+shift+:  type wq and enter\n\n3. Add this cronjob to the supervisor in you=\r\nr OS \n\n\n\n"}}
