Multipart entity \n&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t sound like the right thing though.\n&gt; I am using Apache&#39;s HTTPComponents 4.0.1. The Multipart thing was just a\n&gt; shot in the dark but the effect was the same as with the StringEntity.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; But are you saying that the cxml you get back from heritrix is different \n&gt;&gt; from the one you send it? E.g. here -\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; curl -T a.cxml [...] \n&gt;&gt; https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob/jobdir/crawler-beans.cxml\n&gt;&gt; curl -o b.cxml [...] \n&gt;&gt; https://localhost:8443/engine/job/myjob/jobdir/crawler-beans.cxml\n&gt;&gt; md5sum a.cxml b.cxml\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ... the two md5s differ? If that&#39;s the case, it seems like that would \n&gt;&gt; have to be a bug in restlet or maybe an encoding issue...\n&gt; Yes, they do differ! If I PUT the file the file on Heritrix&#39; side is\n&gt; missing all new lines. This would not be that bad, since it is XML but\n&gt; the seeds cannot be read anymore. They are only one long string without\n&gt; even a space character. So splitting the seeds is practically impossible.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also been thinking about the encoding issue. At least\n&gt; &quot;Content-Type: application/xml&quot; does not help at all. And if I add a\n&gt; german umlaut into the config it is transfered correctly, i.e. I can\n&gt; read it in the Heritrix file.\n&gt; \n&gt; Somehow I think this is related to Restlet but I am unsure...\n&gt; \n&gt; Daniel\n&gt; \n\n"}}
