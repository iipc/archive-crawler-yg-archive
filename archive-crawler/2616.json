Only the lower level of the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;hierarchy (that corresponds to http://www.zzz.com.br) contains any\n&gt;&gt;&gt;configuration. Others levels are empty. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;But I want to apply these filters on the URI&#39;s from a specific domain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;For example:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;* http://www.zzz.com.br/page.php?id=### (this URI is desired)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;* http://www.zzz.com.br/section/page.php (this URI is desired too)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;* http://www.zzz.com.br/print.php?id=### (this URI is not desired,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;because the content was visited before, the id&#39;s are the same and the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;uri has just the content on a good format for printing)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;* http://www.zzz.com.br/sectionNotDesired/page.php (this URI is not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;desired, because it&#39;s section does not matter)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To apply 2 URIRegExpFilters on these URI&#39;s I created a override from\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the address http://www.zzz.com.br/. I think that it&#39;s sufficient to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;cover the main content and the sections of the seed. So the filters\n&gt;&gt;&gt;are on the lower level of the hierarchy (correspondent to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;http://www.zzz.com.br). \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Am I doing anything wrong? Or maybe is it a bug from Heritrix. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This should work, if there are no stray character on any of the\n&gt;&gt;override segments and the filter regular expressions and settings\n&gt;&gt;are correct.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What kind of scope are you using, and where are you inserting the\n&gt;&gt;filter?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Are you using regular expressions to match what&#39;s wanted, or\n&gt;&gt;what&#39;s excluded?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Feel free to send you order.xml -- both global and the one in\n&gt;&gt;the relevant override settings subditrectory -- to either the list\n&gt;&gt;or me directly for a closer look.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;- Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/post?act=reply&messageNum=2613\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Gordon, \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for answering just now. Last week was so busy. \n&gt; \n&gt; I was looking for a stray character on all of the override segments\n&gt; and I didn&#39;t find any. The filters are correct because when I try to\n&gt; crawl a domain, I create a simple job (without overrides) and the\n&gt; filters do work. When I create a job with more than one domain, and\n&gt; create a override for each domain, the same filters (from the simple\n&gt; job) are applied on the specific override. In this case they (filters)\n&gt; don&#39;t work.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m actually using Host scope, and these filters are created as a\n&gt; Exclude-Filter. The URI&#39;s that I want to accept, are expressed as a\n&gt; regular expression and the return value is FALSE. The URI&#39;s that I\n&gt; don&#39;t want to accept are also expressed as a regular expression but\n&gt; the return value is TRUE.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once more, thanks you in advance.\n\nAgain, this really should work, so if you have a compact test case\nyou can forward to demonstrate the problem, we&#39;ll work on it as a\nbug.\n\nIt shouldn&#39;t be necessary to specify two regexes -- one for the\nURIs to accept, one for the URIs to reject. If one regex specifies\nall that must be rejected (or accepted), you can just use that\none (inverted if necessary).\n\nAre you using any &#39;force-accept-filters&#39;?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
