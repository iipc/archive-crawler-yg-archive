That&#39;s somewhat\naggressive, but usually harmless. In this case, it&#39;s triggering\nthe server&#39;s form-accept script to send mail to the given\naddress, and in the absence of form-values supplied it seems to\nbe using the request-headers.\n\n- Gordon @ Bitzi\n\n\nKaisa Kaunonen wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; does Heritrix send web forms forward to email addresses?\n&gt; \n&gt; Namely, a local Sibelius-Academy keeps a web form where you can order\n&gt; their students to perform at various happenings for a fee. You fill in\n&gt; your info, press a submit-button and send the info to an email address\n&gt; associated with the form.\n&gt; \n&gt; The web form, although an empty one, was sent to their press manager.\n&gt; She got the impression that we might be interested to have one of\n&gt; their student bands here at our library.\n&gt; \n&gt; She received the the form and got this information about sender\n&gt; from = hyk-webcrawler@...  \t\t\n&gt;    [this is our contact address in order.xml]\n&gt; sender&#39;s machine or proxy = nwa6a.lib.helsinki.fi        \n&gt;    [machine where heritrix runs]\n&gt; browser = mozilla/5.0 (compatible; heritrix/1.0.4\n&gt; +http://www.lib.helsinki.fi/)\n&gt; web form = \n&gt; \n&gt; This is actually not a problem since I haven&#39;t heard of anything\n&gt; similar before.
