A couple questions follow:\n&gt; \n&gt; If I run multiple importUris at the same time to the same crawler,\n&gt; would it work? It is likely that when doing CrawlMap, more than one\n&gt; crawlers would import uris at the same time.\n\nWe&#39;ve tried it and it works but we&#39;ve no production experience of \nmultiple imports all going into one crawler during a coordinated crawl.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Now the tricky question:\n&gt; How far do people go in terms of doing a CrawlMap on N machines? I\n&gt; was thinking doing a 10-machine CrawlMap on .com domain. Each\n&gt; machine would handle a-b.com, c-d.com, d-e.com, etc. Would you\n&gt; recommend that? Because the immediate problem is whether the\n&gt; communication traffic would slow down the overall crawling (each\n&gt; crawler would take 9 import uris every hour). Is that even a\n&gt; practical approach?\n&gt; \n&gt; That is the only way I can think of to workaround all the memory-\n&gt; based limitation on heritrix for a large crawl.\n&gt; \n\nIgor and I chatted on the above.  Our experience is running crawls with \n3 to 4 coordinated machines doing swap of URLs once a day.  Igor says \nthat he paused crawlers during the imports so the ingest completed quicker.\n\nAs to the volume of intermachine traffic, we have no stats for you here. \n   Igor was suggesting that you have an 11th machine to pull CrawlMapper \ndrop files, aggregate, dedup, and sort all dropped URLs and to invoke \nthe remote crawler importURIs passing URLs that point to files on \nmachine 11 for the remote crawler to import.  Doing it this way, you can \neasily keep an eye on traffic.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; -joe\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@a...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi Joe,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; See an example here:\n&gt;  &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2438\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Take care,\n&gt;  &gt; i.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Computer security \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+security&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=BHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWDg&gt; \n&gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+training&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=v0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
