Ignoring the entity for resource &quot;https://localhost:8443/engine/job/test2/report/SeedsReport.&quot;. Then, the seedsReport shows &quot;0 notcrawled http://address.com&quot;. All the seeds in crawler-bean.cxml has been download, which indicates the engine and config is OK. But the seeds added through action directory are uncrawled. What is the problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; The .seeds file contains a single line &quot;http://address.com/&quot;. Is it the right format?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks very much.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
