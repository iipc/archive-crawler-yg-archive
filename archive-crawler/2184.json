With every feth \nthis &quot;waittime&quot; is lowered if the page had actually changed and raised \nif the page was the same as last time.\n\nThe ARFrontier does not use HEAD requests at all (hope I recall right on \nthis one).\n\nWith your approach you will have to revisit all pages (with HEAD \nrequests) on a regularly basis - with some pages altered with only few \nminutes between it will be a large overhead - even though you use only \nHEAD requests (at least for some sites)\n\nThe check for updating is done with a simple md5 at the moment (it means \nfetching the actual content every time) - this could be altered to  use \nhttp-headers (even though they are not always reliable).\n\nThe ARFrontier might work in your setup - but I don&#39;t see why you would \nrun with both your filter and the ARFrontier ?\n\nbest\nBjarne Andersen\n\nDennis Hotson wrote:\n&gt; On Mon, 2005-09-12 at 11:49 -0700, stack wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve written a proof of concept filter class that does this (well\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; actually, it&#39;s not quite working yet).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; How does your filter work?\n&gt; \n&gt; The filter I wrote manually does a HEAD request and then checks the date\n&gt; against the database I&#39;m storing pages in.. if the page needs updating\n&gt; then the filter passes.. otherwise the filter will fail and the url gets\n&gt; skipped.\n&gt; When I get time, I&#39;ll finish it off and test to see if it actually\n&gt; works.. :P\n&gt; \n&gt; I just had a look at the AdaptiveRevisitingFrontier... from my\n&gt; understanding it will behave like a regular frontier except that it\n&gt; checks whether content needs updating first. After getting the content\n&gt; it will then wait a specified time before crawling it again. Is this\n&gt; correct?\n&gt; How does it check if the page needs updating? I&#39;m using Heritrix to\n&gt; insert pages into a TeraText database (http://www.teratext.com.au) and\n&gt; I&#39;ve written a custom Writer/Processor module to insert the pages into\n&gt; the database (as opposed to the default ARCWriter module).\n&gt; \n&gt; Will this frontier still work with my setup?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks very much for you help. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
