Sometimes they are then used by Javascript \nin the page (which we cannot execute) to send the browser somewhere when \nthe user selects/clicks; other times they are returned to the server \nwhich then redirects to the named URI.\n\nSo, when those values &#39;look like URIs&#39; to us -- chiefly, by having \ninternal &#39;.&#39; or &#39;/&#39; characters without internal spaces -- we try them as \nURIs. As Stack noted, we usually will risk 404s to avoid missing content \nthat we couldn&#39;t discover otherwise.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
