See the &quot;dev-crawl&quot; directory for an example.\n\nOther example/testing configurations and the web crawler admin UI have NOT\nyet been updated for the new-style order file and processor chain.\n\nThere are many other changes -- fixing some bugs, surely introducing others.\nA more detailed note about the changes is coming soon, after a chance for\nsome discussion and cleanup work here.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
