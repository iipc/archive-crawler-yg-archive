At least one of these is required for the DNS \nfetches, prerequisites for getting anything else from a named host, to \nbe allowed. Add at least the Prerequisite rule to the end of your rules.\n\nBy not having the TransclusionDecideRule, you might miss iframes and \nredirects to other-host URIs that (as far as users arc concerned) seem \nto be &quot;on&quot; your target host. Perhaps this is OK for your purposes, but \nit&#39;s something to be aware of.\n\nLeaving off the PathologicalPath and TooManyPathSegments rules means a \nfew kinds of URI patterns that are usually indicative of crawler traps \n(endless URI spaces of negligible value) won&#39;t be eliminated. This might \nnot be an issue for your crawl, but it&#39;s another thing to consider.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\ndisappearedng@... wrote:\n&gt; Hey everyone,\n&gt; I am experimenting with Heritrix to try out some simple search algorithms that I have designed. Unfortunately, my bandwidth sucks hence I will only crawl my neighbourhood&#39;s inner LAN domains.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are the critirieas that I want:\n&gt; 1) exclude these rubbish for now: REGEX: .*(?i)&#92;.(doc|xls|pdf|gif|jpe?g|mpe?g|tiff?|ps|png|swf|wmv|mp3|wma|ico|bmp|rm|rmvb|avi|zip|rar)$\n&gt; 2) Ignore [&#92;S]*lwakaka.com[&#92;S]*\n&gt; 3) ignore [&#92;S]*59.77.131.[&#92;S]*\n&gt; 4) Only crawl from those domains of the seeds\n&gt; \n&gt; I have tried the whole day experimenting with a deciding rule filter, and I have set the following (which makes the most logical sense but still fails):\n&gt; \n&gt; Base org.archive.crawler.deciderules.AcceptDecideRule ?\n&gt; AcceptRule: always gives ACCEPT decision.\n&gt; \n&gt; Crap  org.archive.crawler.deciderules.MatchesRegExpDecideRule ?\n&gt; Decision: Reject\n&gt; regexp: .*(?i)&#92;.(doc|xls|pdf|gif|jpe?g|mpe?g|tiff?|ps|png|swf|wmv|mp3|wma|ico|bmp|rm|rmvb|avi|zip|rar)$\n&gt; \n&gt; lib   org.archive.crawler.deciderules.MatchesRegExpDecideRule ?\n&gt; Decision: Reject\n&gt; [&#92;S]*lwakaka.com[&#92;S]*\n&gt; \n&gt; lib2   org.archive.crawler.deciderules.MatchesRegExpDecideRule ?\n&gt; Decision: Reject\n&gt; [&#92;S]*59.77.131.[&#92;S]*\n&gt; \n&gt; LAN org.archive.crawler.deciderules.NotOnHostsDecideRule ?\n&gt; DECISION REJECT\n&gt; \n&gt; When I submit this job,\n&gt; I am getting the following error:\n&gt; Heritrix(-63)-Prerequisite unschedulable failure \n&gt; Failed to crawl seed \thttp://lanaddress1.ca\n&gt;  Heritrix(-63)-Prerequisite unschedulable failure \n&gt; Failed to crawl seed \thttp://lanaddress2.ca\n&gt;  Heritrix(-63)-Prerequisite unschedulable failure \n&gt; Failed to crawl seed \thttp://lanaddress3.ca\n&gt;  Heritrix(-63)-Prerequisite unschedulable failure \n&gt; Failed to crawl seed \thttp://lanaddress4.ca\n&gt;  Heritrix(-63)-Prerequisite unschedulable failure \n&gt; Failed to crawl seed \thttp://lanaddress5.ca\n&gt;  Heritrix(-63)-Prerequisite unschedulable failure \n&gt; Failed to crawl seed \thttp://lanaddress6.ca\n&gt; \n&gt; can someone explain WHY?
