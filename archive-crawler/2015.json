By trial and error I\n&gt; have found that jboss-jmx.jar causes the problem. After removing this\n&gt; JAR Heritrix works fine. Further testing revealed that this problem\n&gt; still exists in 3.2.7 but is gone in 4.0.1 (at least I tested on those\n&gt; two). ...why that error happens, I don&#39;t know since I have not looked\n&gt; at the source of that JAR.\n\nProbably because we include the JMX reference implementation in Heritrix \nand its clashing with the jboss JMX implementation.  What happens if you \nleave in place the jboss-jmx jar and instead remove from under Heritrix \njmxri*.jar and the jmxtools*.jars?\n\nDoes your bundling reveal the Heritrix UI or is it your apps UI that \nshows -- with your UI revealing the current state of the underlying crawl?\n\nOn and off I&#39;ve been experimenting trying to bundle Heritrix as an EAR \n(I&#39;m having a classpath ordering issue where commons-httpclient can&#39;t \nfind the overlays that are in the heritrix jar. Anyone have any \nsuggestions?).  The intent would be to have it so you could just drop \nHeritrix into a J2EE container and have both its UI and JMX interface \nauto-deploy.  Heritrix would then be available as a &#39;service&#39; useable by \nother container &#39;services&#39;, and in turn, it&#39;d be possible for Heritrix \nto make use of container services such as clustering, messaging, etc.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Bye,\n&gt; Holger\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stackarchiveorg&quot; &lt;stack@a...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Holger Stenzhorn&quot; &lt;holger@x&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have embedded Heritrix into an information sytsem I wrote and there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I call its API directly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Until recently I have used Heritrix 1.2 under JDK 1.4. Now I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; updated to Heritrix 1.4 (with JDK 1.4) and get the following error\n&gt; &gt; &gt; message: &quot;name is not a valid java type (or is a reserved word):\n&gt; &gt; &gt; settings-directory&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If I use JDK 1.5 everything works fine - but for a costumer I need to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use JDK 1.4.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I took a look at the MANIFEST in the JAR file of Heritrix I saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it was compiled with JDK 1.5. So I rebuild Heritrix from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sources with JDK 1.4.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But still the above described error happens as before.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You get this message trying to compile the application that integrates\n&gt; &gt; Heritrix? Are you setting the javac &#39;-target&#39; to be 1.4? See here for\n&gt; &gt; discussion of &#39;-target&#39; on javac:\n&gt; &gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javac.html\n&gt; &gt; (Search for &#39;target&#39;).

That&#39;s our own target JVM version.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
