I notice\n&gt; this usually always works correctly.  It seems as though sometimes a\n&gt; crawl will last over the timelimit by an large amount, up to hours.  I\n&gt; was wondering does setting the timelimit cause an abrupt stop or does\n&gt; it wait until things that it may be currently downloading to finish. \n&gt; For example if it hit the timeout but was downloading a large ISO\n&gt; would it try to finish it before ending?  Thanks,\n&gt; ~chris\n&gt;\nEach thread goes to the frontier to ask it for the next URI to crawl.  \nInside in the Frontier#next is the check if the max-time-to-crawl value \nhas been exceeded.\n\nThis means that if a thread is currently struggling w/ a download, it \nwill only notice that max-time-to-crawl has been exceeded after the \ncurrent awkward download has completed when it goes to ask the frontier \nwhats next. \n\nThere is no abrupt abort of downloads.\n\n&quot;Up to hours&quot; seems odd though.  Can you watch the frontier report to \nsee threads quieting down?  Can you attribute the &#39;hours&#39; to a \nparticular download -- perhaps doing a parallel fetch of the problematic \nURL to confirm its taking hours to download?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
