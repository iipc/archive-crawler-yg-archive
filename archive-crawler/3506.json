The software has=\r\n\nproven very stable and has been used in production crawls both here in\nIce=\r\nland and in Denmark (Netarkivet.dk) for large crawls. \n\nFuture work will be=\r\n primarily related to compatibility with the WARC\nfile format currently bei=\r\nng developed. \n\nBest,\nKris\n\n\n\n"}}
