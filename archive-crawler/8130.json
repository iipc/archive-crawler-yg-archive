In &quot;packages.html&quot; inside the main package where\n&gt; Heritrix.java is located it talks about a couple things like &quot;admin&quot;\n&gt; which should be located at: {@link org.archive.crawler.admin\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.admin}, which is nowhere to be found, as well as\n&gt; the datamodel which is located at:{@link\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.datamodel org.archive.crawler.datamodel}. I have\n&gt; the datamodel package, but it only contains one java file for\n&gt; UriUniqFilter.java, when the documentation says it is also supposed\n&gt; to contain files such as CandidateURI and CrawlURI, which are both\n&gt; essential. The crawler works, so assume they are at least somewhere.\n&gt; Is this just bad documentation? Or are some of these files gone?\n&gt;\n&gt; On a different note, I would also like to find the files for the Web\n&gt; UI itself. I assume they are JSP files or Servlets. Could someone\n&gt; point me to what package, or folder they might be located in?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks! Keith\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
