(Or perhaps: can\n&gt;     only do a small number of internal/approved domain lookups.) This\n&gt;     will need to be resolved in the machine&#39;s configuration for Heritrix\n&gt;     to work.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Heritrix can direct HTTP requests through a configured proxy -- but\n&gt;     expects to be able to do DNS lookups itself. It would take a code\n&gt;     change to enable skipping DNS lookups when an HTTP proxy is to be\n&gt;     used, and it would mean there would be no record of the actual IP\n&gt;     address contacted (which would be a problem for our usual\n&gt;     archival-record use, though would make sense in other applications).\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     On 11/23/10 1:08 AM, Allen Sim wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Dear Gordon,\n&gt;         I am so glad to hear from you!\n&gt;         Wow, Indeed you are very Sharp and you understood my problem!\n&gt;         I tried to type the following in my terminal and i got the\n&gt;         following:\n&gt;         [root@localhost ~]# wget http://www.swinburne.edu.my\n&gt;         &lt;http://www.swinburne.edu.my/&gt;\n&gt;         --2010-11-23 17:04:43-- http://www.swinburne.edu.my/\n&gt;         Resolving www.swinburne.edu.my... failed: Temporary failure in name\n&gt;         resolution.\n&gt;         wget: unable to resolve host address `www.swinburne.edu.my\n&gt;         &lt;http://www.swinburne.edu.my/&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;http://www.swinburne.edu.my &lt;http://www.swinburne.edu.my/&gt;&gt;&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt;         But the strange thing is that i can browse successfully\n&gt;         www.swinburne.edu.my &lt;http://www.swinburne.edu.my/&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;http://www.swinburne.edu.my &lt;http://www.swinburne.edu.my/&gt;&gt; at\n&gt;         the machine&#39;s\n&gt;\n&gt;         graphical browser.\n&gt;         What&#39;s wrong with it?
