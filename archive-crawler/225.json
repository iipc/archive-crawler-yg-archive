I don&#39;t see any point in our having 3 labels for one repository state. Lets only use the heritrix-?.?.? label in the repository when making releases (whether dev or stable).  The updating (and committing) of our software version as maintained in config. files (project.xml) should be sufficent for making the &#39;pedigree&#39; of what it is that external users are running clear (I&#39;d also suggest no need of the &#39;cvs&#39; suffix for version numbers -- the &#39;odd&#39; numbering scheme should be signifier enough that current state is &#39;development&#39;).\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n\nI can see dropping the 0_1_x, but the 0_3_0 serves a valuable purpose.\n\nNamely, as soon as the release version 0_2_0 is done, but before\nanother dev version number is assigned, there will be code changes,\nperhaps significant ones. Builds from that development would\nidentify, misleadingly, as 0_2_0 until a dev version number is\nassigned.\n\nSo I&#39;d like to assign that dev number immediately after a stable\nrelease, making it nearly impossible for anything fetched from\nCVS to give confusing version info.\n\nSound OK?\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
