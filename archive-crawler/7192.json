(In H3, this is the \n&#39;seedsRedirectNewSeeds&#39; setting on CandidatesProcessor.)\n\nIf it is treated as a new seed, it is announced in a way that scope \nrules that depend on seeds to determine what they accept may update \nthemselves, so from that point on a new set of URIs will be accepted. An \nattempt will also be made to append the new seed to the \nseeds-source-text, if it is a writable file on disk.\n\nThat seed redirect is treated like other redirects in terms of \nqueue-scheduling. In fact, the default &#39;preferenceEmbedHops&#39; setting \nvalue in FrontierPreparer, &quot;1&quot;, means that single runs of all \nnon-navlink (&#39;L&#39;) hop-types get a boost in queueing that usually puts \nthem in front of other URIs, meaning they will be crawled faster. And, \nif the redirect is to an all-new site, the target URI will be the first \nURI crawled from that queue.\n\nSo there shouldn&#39;t be any big delay in crawling the redirects. If you \nare seeing a delay � perhaps you might if using a very large seed list, \nbecause all of the initially-seeded queues would need to have their \nchance to run before the all-new queue becoems &#39;ready&#39; � there are other \nadjustments you can make to cycle through all the queues more rapidly \nthat might help.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 6/21/11 8:42 PM, mickey.guoyun wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; HI,Gordon,\n&gt; why Heritrix make redirection url as a seed url,and put it into the\n&gt; crawl queue&#39;s tail position?\n&gt; we can make redirection url as a common url,why make it as a seed\n&gt; url?only let it can write the redirection record into seeds.txt?\n&gt; and why put it into the crawl queue&#39;s end?because it will delay so much\n&gt; time to crawl.\n&gt; 2011-06-22\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; mickey.guoyun\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
