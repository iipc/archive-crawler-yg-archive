Many HTTP \nclient utilities have an SSL option.\n\nWe considered, but ultimately did not include in H3, a command-line \nswitch to listen for plain HTTP rather than HTTPS.\n\nYou could use some combination of other netcat/openssl programs to set \nup a proxy that accepts normal HTTP and forwards to HTTPS. For example, \nusing the &#39;ncat&#39; program that&#39;s part of &#39;nmap&#39;, this one-liner on the \nsame machine as the crawler sets up such a proxy on port 8008:\n\n% ncat -l 8008 -c &quot;ncat --ssl localhost 8443&quot;\n\nBe sure to review and understand the &#39;Security Considerations&#39; of the \nHeritrix administrative interface:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Security+Considerations\n\nNote especially that if your crawler operator credentials are \ncompromised by any mechanism (observed in transit over unencrypted link; \nfailure to verify that SSL connect was with intended server-certificate; \nchoice of weak login/password; etc.), then resulting unauthorized access \nto the crawler interface allows an attacker to change files, and run \narbitrary code, on the crawler machine with the privileges of the user \naccount used to the launch the Java VM.\n\nThat&#39;s why we recommend:\n\n  - pick strong credentials\n  - only connect via HTTPS, and verify the expected server certificate\n  - use additional redundant mechanisms (listening only for local \nconnections; firewall policies) to prevent connections from unexpected \nplaces\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
