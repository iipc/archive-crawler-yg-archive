I have tried using\nfilter =\r\nrules and surt scope.\n\nBut my difficulty is how can I get the final pdf lin=\r\nks in a single txt\nfile. Currently, I can see all types of links in the cra=\r\nwl.log file\nand the only solution I see is to parse this log file to get th=\r\ne pdf\nlinks.\n\nPlease someone suggest a way to get only the pdf links in a f=\r\nile as\nthe crawler output. I need only the links, not the actual files.\n\nTh=\r\nanks.\n\n-Sanket Jain\n\n\n"}}
