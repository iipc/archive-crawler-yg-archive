Makes logs ~30% bigger than \n&gt; then need to be.\n\nThe fields up to the URI are justified with extra spaces for easier\nhuman readability: all lengths, statuses, and URIs line up for\nat-a-glance comparisons. Fields after the URI are ragged, delimited\nby a single space.\n\nThe size boost should be much less than 30% per line, and if\nlog size ever became critical we coulg GZIP them on the fly,\nmaking the marginal cost of runs of spaces negligible...\n\n&gt; You make the result codes negative to distingush from the HTTP status \n&gt; code returned?  Otherwise I&#39;d suggest reusing them (E.g: 408 Request \n&gt; Timeout  instead of  &quot;-4 E_SoTime Socket Timeout&quot;).  Otherwise,  +1.\n\nNegative has been the existing convention; that should become an\nexternal detail once symbolic statuses in logs are implemented.\n\nAs they currently appear in the same log field, reuse of similar\ncodes would make it ambiguous as to whether the error came over\nthe net or was generated by a local condition.\n\n&gt; All sounds good.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do we have any reporting tools to go against our logs?\n\nNot yet, but we could start collecting Igor&#39;s most useful\npostprocessing/reporting scripts into CVS somewhere.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
