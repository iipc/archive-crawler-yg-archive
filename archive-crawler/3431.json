Our HTTP lib, \ncommons httpclient, support this: See \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/authentication.html#Proxy_Authentication.   \n\n\nOne approach would duplicate the section for filling in credentials so \nit also sits under the proxy settings in our FetchHTTP processor.\n\nIf you&#39;d like to make a patch, we&#39;ll apply it.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\ntintangsg wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; Thanks Laurence and Gordon, I&#39;ve changed the proxy to IP address and\n&gt; don&#39;t get the connection refused error anymore. However, there is a\n&gt; new error as follows:\n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector AuthenticationNeeded\n&gt; INFO: Authentication requested but doAuthentication is disabled\n&gt;\n&gt; There must be somewhere in the order.xml where I can set the\n&gt; authentication name and password or something similar. Can anyone\n&gt; please tell me the use of the following in the HTTP header and how\n&gt; to use them?\n&gt; - WWW-Authenticate\n&gt; - Proxy-Authenticate\n&gt; - Proxy-Authorization\n&gt;\n&gt; Best of all, how to get Heritrix to pass proxy authentication given\n&gt; that the proxy host IP and port is already specified?\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Tim\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:archive-crawler%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; tintangsg wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please read on and give me some suggestions!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My crawler seems to be able to crawl webpages on my local\n&gt; machine but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not go out to the Internet.

I&#39;ve tried to encode the string =\n&gt; &gt; &gt; username:password using base 64 and put it in the &quot;Proxy-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Authorization&quot; field in the HTTP header in the order.xml file as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; follows:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;map name=&quot;http-headers&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;string name=&quot;Proxy-\n&gt; Authorization&quot;&gt;dGYhhtdDp0bGGGGGwM==&lt;/string&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but it still doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not familiar with proxy-authorization practices, so I don&#39;t\n&gt; know if\n&gt; &gt; this could be your problem or your added header could possibly\n&gt; help.
