Each\n&gt;   of these non-default formats reports one queue per line, and does\n&gt;   not truncate the lists after a few thousand, like the default\n&gt;   report does. Thus, in a large crawl, they can take a while to dump.\n&gt;   As the names suggest, &#39;all&#39; shows all queues -- even those that\n&gt;   have been exhausted -- and &#39;nonempty&#39; only those with items remaining.\n&gt;   A legend explaining each field of the single-line display will\n&gt;   appear at top.\n&gt;* the &#39;dumpFile&#39; parameter may give the name of file, relative to the\n&gt;   crawler working directory, to which to dump the report rather than\n&gt;   to the browser.\n&gt;\n&gt;So for example, the following URL...\n&gt;\n&gt;   http://localhost:8080/reports/frontier.jsp?name=all&dumpFile=frontier-all.report\n&gt;\n&gt;...would dump the queue-per-line all-queues Frontier report to the\n&gt;file &#39;frontier-all.report&#39; in the working directory in which\n&gt;the crawler was launched.\n&gt;\n&gt;Someday, UI controls to reach these options will be added.\n&gt;\n&gt;Keep in mind that a queue can be temporarily exhausted -- with more\n&gt;URLs to be discovered from offsite inlinks right around the corner.\n&gt;This might even be quite common early in crawls, if a few lone\n&gt;resources are referenced from a site before reaching its own\n&gt;interlinked content.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hope this helps,\n&gt;\n&gt;- Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
