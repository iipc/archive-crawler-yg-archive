Most settings and components \nfrom 1.x versions remain, though the on-disk settings format and job \ndirectory layout has changed somewhat. We are especially interested in \nwhether people are able to use the web UI to duplicate and successfully \nlaunch crawl configurations equivalent to what they relied upon in 1.x.\n\nQuestions and discussion are as always welcome on the project discussion \nlist:\n\n   archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n   http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/\n\nBugs and enhancement requests may be entered in the JIRA project issue \ntracker:\n\n   http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER\n\nPlease, also feel free to expand the Heritrix wiki with tips, \nuser-supplied-documentation, and ideas.
