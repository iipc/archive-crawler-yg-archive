Currently\n&gt;I keep n copies of the entire distro around, and invoke each one with\n&gt;a customized start script that sets the appropriate port and\n&gt;authentication credentials.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Looking at the code, it looks like I could have a single installation\n&gt;and multiple properties files, which specify by setting\n&gt;heritrix.properties on the command-line. So I have one copy of\n&gt;Heritrix that I start with different ports and different credentials.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWe&#39;ve not played with running mutliple crawls concurrently within the \none JVM instance. Hardest thing would be making the UI work with other \nthan one job at a time.  If UI wasn&#39;t needed, there&#39;d be some wrestling \ninitially to make sure each crawl had its own config. and didn&#39;t share \nresources, but thereafter, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to get it going.\n\nThere&#39;s been little call for such a runtime configuration.  Do people \nthink it important?\n\n&gt;And this raises another question, actually:\n&gt;\n&gt;Would it be possible, or is it already, to specify the port and\n&gt;login/password in the properties file?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;ll add this to HEAD later today.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;TIA,\n&gt;\n&gt;    -tree\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
