The notion would be that there \nwould be an overarching &#39;archive-access&#39; master project that had under \nit multiple subprojects.  Example subprojects might include the tools \ndescribed here: http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?AccessTools.  \nWe&#39;d also try moving ARC core java reading and writing here as has been \ndiscussed previously on this list so others don&#39;t have to include all of \nthe crawler when they just want to read/writer ARCs.\n\nComments?
