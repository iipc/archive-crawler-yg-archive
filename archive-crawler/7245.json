If we see more users clamoring for it then we&#39;ll be more likely to get to it sooner. Of course, supplying a patch always helps bump it up too. :)\n\nI&#39;m not sure I understand your example. Could you elaborate a bit, on the jira or here?\n\nNoah\n\n\nOn 2011-07-28 05:31 , Tom Zeithaml wrote:\n&gt; hm, i think it is a important feature.\n&gt;\n&gt; Example:\n&gt; There is a Domain with 100 Sites.

That\n&gt;&gt; technique can&#39;t work today because the scope rule has no way of knowing\n&gt;&gt; that the link came from a a[@rel=&#39;nofollow&#39;]/@href, as far as I can see\n&gt;&gt; after a quick look. CrawlURI.linkContext would seem to be a logical\n&gt;&gt; place for that information, and HTMLLinkContext could be enhanced to\n&gt;&gt; that effect.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Noah\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 07/24/2011 11:38 AM, Tom Zeithaml wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it possible to skip&lt;a ... rel=nofollow Links ?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe a workaround in org.archive.crawler.extractor\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Class ExtractorHTML is possible ?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; best regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Tom\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
