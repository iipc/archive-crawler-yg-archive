You can put all sorts of\nfilters in=\r\n to try and catch it. Simple enough for any particular\ninstance, harder to =\r\ndo generically. \n\nIf you are doing somewhat focused crawling (i.e. few site=\r\ns) the best\noption is to simply handle this on a case by case basis using R=\r\negExpr\nfilters to either ignore the calendar altogether or to limit the\ncra=\r\nwling to current year +/- some number.\n\nIf you&#39;re doing large scale crawlin=\r\ng you may simply want &#39;take the\nhit&#39;. You&#39;ll never &#39;finish&#39; anyway so you j=\r\nust accept it, perhaps\ndealing with them when you see a specific calendar b=\r\neing used by many\nwebsites.\n\n- Kris\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, robert laing &lt;r.laing@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0 Hi,\n&gt; i&#39;m running an harvest=\r\ning on a public site, where is available\n&gt; a php calendar, with url like th=\r\nis\n&gt; http://..../calendar/index.php?Calendar&Y=3D2015&m=3D4&d=3D27\n&gt; \n&gt; i g=\r\nuess that this urls are generated endless \n&gt; (every page month links next m=\r\nonth and so on)\n&gt; \n&gt; what is the behaviour of heritrix in such cases?\n&gt; wha=\r\nt is the right manner to proceed?\n&gt; \n&gt; greets\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       ______=\r\n____________________________________________________\n&gt; Sent from Yahoo!
