As such it\ngave=\r\n us\n&gt; certain insights into the general problem and ultimately showed that\n=\r\nit was\n&gt; much more difficult than we had hoped.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, absent accu=\r\nrate change detection the adaptive part is\nextremely\n&gt; hard to achieve. As =\r\nmy paper discusses, this is a problem without a\nviable\n&gt; solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\nre were also issues with limiting the scope of crawls. Truly\nincremental\n&gt; =\r\ncrawls require that the scope be finite (i.e. no crawler traps).\nPossible\n&gt;=\r\n for small crawls, this becomes increasingly difficult as the scope\nexpands=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; The above led me to rethink the whole approach. If we couldn&#39;t use\n=\r\nadaptive\n&gt; techniques, then the likely value of a truly incremental crawlin=\r\ng\nstyle was\n&gt; greatly diminished. The, much simplified, alternative (which =\r\nhas\nproven a\n&gt; great success) is described in this article: \n&gt;\nhttp://vefso=\r\nfnun.bok.hi.is/upload/3/ManagingDuplicatesAcrossSequentialCrawls\n&gt; .pdf\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Basically, it is a simple filter to eliminate duplicate documents in a\n&gt; =\r\nseries of crawls.\n&gt; \n&gt; This has proven extremely successful and has been us=\r\ned by the national\n&gt; libraries of Iceland and Denmark (and possibly others =\r\nI don&#39;t know\nabout)\n&gt; for the last year or so.\n&gt; \n&gt; See further: http://ded=\r\nuplicator.sourceforge.net\n&gt; \n&gt; The Internet Archive added a similar ability=\r\n directly to the crawler\nas of\n&gt; version 1.12.0. I haven&#39;t tested it myself=\r\n, but I&#39;ve heard that it\nperforms\n&gt; quite well. There are plans at the IA t=\r\no address the notion of\nincremental\n&gt; crawling again but this will not happ=\r\nen until later this year and it is\n&gt; unclear exactly how that will happen.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The ARFrontier has received no attention of late and currently we are\n=\r\n&gt; considering dropping it from the upcoming 2.0.0 release, although\nthis is=\r\n\n&gt; still undecided. As far as I know nobody is using it. It seems\nunlikely =\r\nthat\n&gt; it will be developed further barring 3rd party contributions to the\n=\r\nproject.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that answers your questions. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Orig=\r\ninal Message-----\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com on behalf of lore=\r\nngordon\n&gt; Sent: Wed 6/13/2007 3:42 PM\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com=\r\n\n&gt; Subject: [archive-crawler] Incremental Crawlling and the\n&gt; AdaptiveRevis=\r\nitingFrontier\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;m interesting in the incremental crawling presented i=\r\nn this document:\n&gt; http://www.iwaw.net/05/papers/iwaw05-sigurdsson.pdf\n&gt; &lt;h=\r\nttp://www.iwaw.net/05/papers/iwaw05-sigurdsson.pdf&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Is anyone using t=\r\nhe AdaptiveRevisitingFrontier that was developed as a\n&gt; result of that stud=\r\ny?
