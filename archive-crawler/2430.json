I could do this in the event queue, but if \n&gt; y=\r\nou make it \n&gt; &gt; so that the CrawlController is easily overridable then this=\r\n should \n&gt; &gt; suffice as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; This would probably be better done in yo=\r\nur own CrawlJobHandler in the \n&gt; crawlEnded. This is how the selftest works=\r\n It notices end of \n&gt; crawl then \n&gt; goes off to do its examination of what =\r\nwas crawled. Or you could \n&gt; register with CrawlController an implementatio=\r\nn of the \n&gt; CrawlStatusListener (Or I could add notifications of checkpoint=\r\ning to \n&gt; JMX notifications).\n\nI probably will use the CrawlStatusListener =\r\nfor this.\n\n&gt; Adding a constructor to Heritrix that allows you add your own =\r\n\n&gt; CJH would \n&gt; be cleaner than the way it currently works where we have th=\r\ne \n&gt; setJobHandler method (Would likely avoid the race condition \n&gt; you tal=\r\nked \n&gt; of in an earlier mail).  \n\nI agree with this, much nicer implementat=\r\nion.\n\n&gt; I could add this but you are using \n&gt; Heritrix#main to setup the cr=\r\nawler.  You are not using Heritrix \n&gt; constructors directly. Thats why I wa=\r\ns asking about why you were not \n&gt; doing &#39;new Heritrix(...)&#39;.  Was it not w=\r\norking for you?\n\nI couldn&#39;t get it to work, but I didn&#39;t try that hard eith=\r\ner, and main seems\nto do some nice configuration things. :) I could give it=\r\n an attempt, was\nmore worried with getting it running for a local project.\n=\r\n\n&gt; Registering a CrawlStatusListener should be easy enough.  \n&gt; You&#39;d proba=\r\nbly \n&gt; miss out on the first few crawlStarting messages but you \n&gt; probably=\r\n don&#39;t \n&gt; care.\n\n\n\n"}}
