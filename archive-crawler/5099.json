We will not use other indexing\nthan our own.\n\nSome particular questions:\n\n- Which crawler will handle crawling for images best?\n- Which crawler will best adapt to a distributed crawling system, in which we\n  use many servers conducting crawling together?\n- Which crawler is/will be under most active development?\n\n\nAny views on this?\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSvein Willassen\n\n"}}
