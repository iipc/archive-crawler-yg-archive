To do this, you must parse the HTML, PDF, etc.\n&gt; on the fly.  (I have code examples if you want to see how; maybe \n&gt; this should be a section in the user manual for Heritrix).  bergmark_d\n\nThis is what I want to do.  Let&#39;s say I find an image archive of\n10,000 pages, or an article archive with 50,000 articles.  It would be\neasy to triage this to just a few hundred pages by simple search\ncriteria.  I would rather just download those few hundred to begin\nwith rather than grab zillions of pages and post process them.\n\nIf I could see how you wrote such a module -- particularly how you get\nit to work with heretrix, that would be wonderful.  I can write a\nparser.  I don&#39;t have a clue as to how to make it work with heretrix.\n\nIt would be extraordinarily useful to have a short tutorial on how to\nwrite modules/filters/whatever for heretrix (I&#39;m still not sure\nwhether this would be a &quot;filter&quot; or &quot;module&quot; or what).\n\nThanks!\n\nbillo\n\n\n\n\n"}}
