Which means that 1.12 was compiled with JDK 1.5\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In order for it to run under JDK 1.4 they class files would have to be version 48.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I can&#39;t find anything one their website that tells which version of the JDK is recommended for 1.12?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I do know that I have problems compile Heritrix under JDK 1.5, and this confuses me, but my own modules compiled under JDK 1.5 work just fine.\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;\n&gt; Hi.\n&gt;\n&gt; (I’m not entirely sure who I’m responding to here; the quoting is all\n&gt; messed up.)\n&gt;\n&gt; First, don’t use gcj. It never works with Java code that hasn’t been\n&gt; made to work with it. If you need to use a GPL Java just wait a little\n&gt; bit, or see if some of the new openjava stuff works. Otherwise\n&gt; download & use Sun’s JDK 1.6.\n&gt;\n&gt; Second, don’t use Fedora/Ubuntu/Debian packaged Java. Generally it’s\n&gt; going to be more trouble than it is worth. Download JDK 1.6 from Sun’s\n&gt; site, unpack it, & install in /opt. Make sure you set JAVA_HOME to be\n&gt; equal to /opt/jdk (or wherever your JDK is installed).\n&gt;\n&gt; Third, don’t compile Heritrix. There is no benefit to this (unless you\n&gt; are modifying the Heritrix source).\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope that helps.
