I&#39;ve been away from Heritrix for a couple years but just got a=\r\nsked to run it again against our web. I launched it with just over 51,000 s=\r\needs, all of them using http (not https). It ran fine for a few days but no=\r\nw it is freezing for long periods of time before it starts going again. (Mi=\r\nnutes or hours... it has currently been stuck for an hour. There isn&#39;t anyt=\r\nhing specific I&#39;ve done to restart it before... it just mysteriously comes =\r\nback to life.) I&#39;m hoping for some ideas how to debug / improve this.\n\nI se=\r\ne the heritrix version 2 line seems to have been dropped (is this why?) and=\r\n versions 1 and 3 are being maintained. 3 seems still experimental / in pro=\r\ngress? Do I need to redo my configs so I can switch to version 1?\n\nTech det=\r\nails (ask me what else you need)\n\nLinux 2.6.18-128.1.16.el5.xs5.5.0.54xen r=\r\nunning as a Virtual Machine\n\nHeritrix started with JAVA_OPTS=3D&quot;-Xmx3584M&quot; =\r\n(the most memory I could request before getting errors)\n\nJAVA_HOME=3D/usr/l=\r\nocal/data/msimkin/java/jre1.6.0_20/\n\n$ cat /proc/swaps\nFilename\t\t\t\tType\t\tSi=\r\nze\tUsed\tPriority\n/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol01         partition\t4161528\t=\r\n2754248\t-1\n\n$ df -h .\nFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted o=\r\nn\n192.168.70.100:/vol/infosec\n                      2.0T  842G  1.1T  44% /=\r\nusr/local/data\n\nThe &quot;top&quot; command reports (partial output)\n\ntop - 09:16:21 =\r\nup 143 days,  9:05,  5 users,  load average: 1.00, 1.03, 1.21\nTasks:  98 to=\r\ntal,   2 running,  95 sleeping,   0 stopped,   1 zombie\nCpu(s):  0.0%us,  0=\r\n.2%sy,  0.0%ni, 50.2%id, 49.6%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st\nMem:   2097152k=\r\n total,  2088640k used,     8512k free,      336k buffers\nSwap:  4161528k t=\r\notal,  2561512k used,  1600016k free,    10120k cached\n\n  PID USER      PR =\r\n NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND                          =\r\n                                                                           =\r\n                          \n 8150 msimkin   15   0 3860m 1.6g 4752 S  0.0 78=\r\n.8   1235:01 java                                                \n\nI interp=\r\nret this to mean there is (virtual) memory available, and heritrix is not t=\r\nrying to do anything that would use CPU. So what does it want?\n\nWhen frozen=\r\n, crawl.log shows no new entries, nor does heritrix_out.log or any other lo=\r\ngfiles, not even progress-statistics.log. They all stop at about the same m=\r\ninute and second. The web interface is also unresponsive, limiting diagnosi=\r\ns there.\n\nruntime-errors.log shows mostly complaints about character sets, =\r\nand has no entries since 4 days ago.\n\nAbout 3 minutes before the latest fre=\r\neze, nonfatal-errors.log shows the following burst of timeouts. (I am runni=\r\nng with 20 threads.)\n\n2012-12-28T15:28:19.419Z    -2          - http://seam=\r\nonkey.ed.asu.edu/swa/discussion/message117.html LLLLL http://wings.buffalo.=\r\nedu/anthropology/Documents/lootbib.shtml unknown #016 - - - \n java.net.Sock=\r\netTimeoutException: connect timed out: timeout set at 20000ms.\n2012-12-28T1=\r\n5:28:19.588Z    -2          - http://robots.asu.edu/index.php/Special:WhatL=\r\ninksHere/MediaWiki_talk:Print.css ELL http://robots.asu.edu/index.php?title=\r\n=3DMediaWiki_talk:Print.css&action=3Dedit&redlink=3D1 unknown #014 - - - \n =\r\njava.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect timed out: timeout set at 20000ms.=\r\n\n2012-12-28T15:28:44.575Z    -2          - http://asusrl.eas.asu.edu/srlab/=\r\nResearch/roboticscamp/2009/mazevideo/mazevideo.html LLLLL http://venus.eas.=\r\nasu.edu/roboticscamp/2009/Closing/index.html unknown #009 - - - \n java.net.=\r\nSocketTimeoutException: connect timed out: timeout set at 20000ms.\n2012-12-=\r\n28T15:28:44.733Z    -2          - http://shumway.physics.asu.edu/codes/doc/=\r\npi/SimulationInfo_8cc.html LLLLLL http://shumway.physics.asu.edu/codes/doc/=\r\npi/files.html unknown #004 - - - \n java.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect=\r\n timed out: timeout set at 20000ms.\n2012-12-28T15:28:44.937Z    -2         =\r\n - http://engineering.asu.edu/printpdf/people/967169 RRLRLLLLLL http://sear=\r\nch.asu.edu/search?q=3Dcache:u8ZQ3tgsqaYJ:engineering.asu.edu/people/967169%=\r\n20psp&output=3Dxml_no_dtd&ie=3DUTF-8&client=3Dasu_frontend&proxystylesheet=\r\n=3Dasu_frontend&access=3Dp&oe=3DISO-8859-1 unknown #003 - - - \n java.net.So=\r\ncketTimeoutException: connect timed out: timeout set at 20000ms.\n\nI have co=\r\nnfigured some sites to be crawled more slowly because of complaints about l=\r\noad.
