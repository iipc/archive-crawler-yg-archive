You are great!\n&gt; I still facing some problem when I am using heritrix:\n&gt; 1.Why is it take me a very long time to archive a website even though I already set the depth and hosts to vry minimun:1 or 2 level.\n&gt; 2. Why is it sometimes the archived progress reach till 99% and it will hang there then it take long hours to finished.\n\nReviewing and understanding the &#39;threads&#39; and &#39;frontier&#39; reports can \nhelp explain why a crawler is progressing as expected, or not. Also, you \nmay find the FAQ helpful:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/crawl+rate+considerations\n\n&gt; 3. Can we avoid to fill in the http-header-user agent and provide the email address... or can we preset it instead of every time when I archived, I need to fill it in.\n\nNo; each job must be configured with acceptable values here. By starting \nyour new configurations with a copy of a prior configuration, you won&#39;t \nhave to reenter the values every time.\n\n&gt; 4.Can I categorized my archived work? Say,\n&gt; Education website: www.abc.com, www.bcd.com, www.efg.com\n&gt; Goverment website: www.xyz.com, www.hij.com, www.klm.com\n&gt; Music website: www.lmn.com, www.opq.com\n\nThere is no built-in feature for this; you would have to code it yourself.\n\n&gt; 5. Can heritrix perform scheduling task? This is beacuase every 2 months I need to re-archive the same websites, IS it possible to automate it, so that every 2 month it will auto acrchive the websites.\n\nAdvanced users can manage this in a few ways. The only info is on the \nwiki and in the source code, about repeating a crawl with certain \nhistory date from the earlier crawls used to avoid refetching or \nrestoring duplicate content. (Look for &quot;Duplication Reduction&quot; info.)\n\nAre you on the same project as &#39;Allen Wilson&#39;/&#39;Allen Sim&#39;? Your \nquestions are very similar in rapid succession, and even similarly \nworded. It&#39;s always good to review recent mail list traffic and search \nthe archives to see if your questions have already been asked/answered.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr&lt;gojomo@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 8/4/10 7:30 PM, HyuuGaBaDita wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Gordon! It&#39;s glad to hear from you! thanks for your reply!U&#39;re\n&gt;&gt;&gt; indeed vry helpful!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.Now that I can remember my login credentials. But can I remove the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; login page and directly go into the heritrix mainpage?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you are visiting from the same browser without having quit and\n&gt;&gt; relaunched the browser, you won&#39;t be prompted again. In most browsers,\n&gt;&gt; even with a quit and relaunch, the values can be saved so you won&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt; to re-type.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Why do you need to eliminate even that step? (Is there something else\n&gt;&gt; you&#39;re trying to achieve?)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You should also review this page about why it is important to limit\n&gt;&gt; access to the administrative interface:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Security+Considerations\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.Thanks for the depthe level setting advice ! It works!!!! and I am\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gald abt it! Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. I still don&#39;t understand how to download more than a website at\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the same time. Is it I just type in all the url addresses in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; seeds textbox, line by line then add in once again all the url\n&gt;&gt;&gt; addresss in the http-header-user agent text box by adding &quot;+&quot; sign.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For example: seeds text box: http://www.abc.com http://www.def.com\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http-header-user agent text box: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; heritrix/1.14.3 +http://www.abc.com +http://www.def.com)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You should not be putting the URLs of the sites you&#39;re crawling into the\n&gt;&gt; &#39;http-user-agent&#39; value!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The HTTP &#39;User-Agent&#39; header is to identify *you* to sites, allowing\n&gt;&gt; them to contact you if anything goes wrong. The URL should be an URL\n&gt;&gt; that describes your purpose in crawling and includes contact information\n&gt;&gt; such as an email address or phone number.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is covered in the H1 User Manual, among other places:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/config.html#httpheaders\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 4.Why is it after we key in the url in the seed box then we need to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; re-keyin the url once agin into the http-header-user agent text box\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and somemore we need to provide our email add in the &quot;from&quot; texbox?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems like doing double work. Can we simplify this? Is there any\n&gt;&gt;&gt; easier way on this?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; See above.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 5.I facing the remote access problem. I installed my heritrix in a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; PC, then when I using my laptop to remote access it to the PC, the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; heritrix show blank page.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; See the User Manual, especially the &#39;Note&#39; under here:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/install.html#N1008F\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Please help me and guide me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You should do a front-to-back read of the User Manual, review the\n&gt;&gt; project wiki, and follow/search others&#39; questions in this discussion\n&gt;&gt; list -- as these questions already have written answers in many places.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance, HyuuGaBaDita\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr&lt;gojomo@&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On 8/3/10 9:23 PM, HyuuGaBaDita wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.
