My firewall seemed to be blocking images.  It&#39;s working now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, at the risk of blocking images again, if I want to crawl only *pages* on the hosts in the seeds file, but to download any embedded images that are hosted on other sites.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, if I were to crawl www.cnn.com, I would want all the images from cdn.turner.com, but I wouldn&#39;t want to crawl any pages on cdn.turner.com (only www.cnn.com).\n\nThere&#39;s no neat, bright-line definition of &#39;pages&#39; to use. For example, \nwhat if HTML on cnn.com pulls in, from other hosts, embedded Javascript \nor CSS required to render that HTML? Usually, people who want embedded \nimages want these files too -- the pages look mangled without them -- so \nvia the &#39;TransclusionDecideRule&#39; in the standard scope, these are also \nretrieved.\n\nHow about embedded frames of HTML from another host? Are they part of \nthe cnn.com &#39;page&#39; or are they a separate &#39;page&#39; on the other host?\n\nAgain, the defaults assume you want these, if they are embedded on your \nmain host of interest, because otherwise you can&#39;t browse an accurate \nrepresentation of the content on the main host. (Similarly, embedded \nimages inside these frames are transitively included as well, even if \nthey are on yet a third host.)\n\nIn general the defaults try to err on the side of collecting too much, \nbecause storage is cheap and a little extra unwanted material can be \nignored in later indexing/viewing, but if a URI is not retrieved and \nthen disappears from the web, it&#39;s gone forever.\n\n&gt; I was thinking about rejecting in a NotOnHostsDecideRule, but accepting if the content type matches &quot;image/.*&quot;, but maybe there&#39;s a better way?\n\nYou don&#39;t even know the content-type of a URI until after it is fetched, \nso content-type can&#39;t help in the scoping rules. (It can be used to \nknock URIs out later -- such as early-aborting the fetch or skipping \nlink-extraction or ARC-storage.)\n\nFor whatever unique definition of &#39;page&#39; or desired inclusion/exclusion \npolicy you have, there&#39;s sure to be a way to implement it. (If it goes \nbeyond what&#39;s possible with the existing rules, you can even add your \nown in Beanshell or Java code.)\n\nBut, tinkering with the rules is likely to have surprising results, \nperhaps missing desired material, until you become experienced in \ncrafting the rule choices and ordering. So I would recommend against it \nunless you&#39;ve tried the default scope, seen exactly what it retrieved \nthat you don&#39;t want, and developed a precise idea of how to exclude \nthose URIs without collateral damage.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;steve@...&quot; &lt;steve@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; hi Scott,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you can inspect the crawl log directly to see if images\n&gt;&gt; are being downloaded. and if you&#39;re using the web UI,\n&gt;&gt; you can look at the log reports.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a colleague just crawled 100 URLs from &quot;www.cnn.com&quot; with\n&gt;&gt; Heritrix 1.14.3 and found 230 GIFs and 174 JPGs in the\n&gt;&gt; logs, most of which came from &quot;cdn.turner.com&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; have you changed your scope to remove the default\n&gt;&gt; *transclusion* of offsite inline images?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; /steve@...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
