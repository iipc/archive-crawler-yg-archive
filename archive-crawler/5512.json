I read the documents, the mailing list(this ML), and\ntried heritrix with ARFrontier, deduplicator; to find,\n1) ARFrontier repeatedly revisit the sites with respect to the Last-Modified header, however,\n   cannot make checkpoints, so I cannot reboot the computer during the crawling,\n2) deduplicator can store download information among crawls, so I can reboot the computer,\n   however it does not store ETag or Last-Modified header, so it always download whole files\n   and check SHA-1 checksums to check the identity.\n\nHere, what I want to do is to crawl repeatedly a large site whose contents change little\nby little continuously, like news sites. (Imagine that there are huge number of articles,\nand articles are added continuously day by day.) \nI want to crawl such a site for years, once a week for example, while\n1) sometimes stop (or suspend) the job for maintenance including reboot the computer, and\n2) resume the job without recrawling the whole site by either\n   2-a) checking only the HTTP headers like ETag or Last-Modified, or\n   2-b) checking even only the URI name.\n(If News sites has unique URI for each article, 2-b may be enough.)\n\nTo store different version of the same URI may be a problem, so it is enought to just keep the\nlatest version of the same URI.\n\nIs this possible with current version of heritrix, or if not, is there any plan?\nThank you in advance.\n\n---\n\tTakeshi Kobayakawa\n\n\n"}}
