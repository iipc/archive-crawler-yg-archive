Make the index concurrent to the writing \nof ARC itself -- you&#39;d need to subclass the ARC Writer to accomplish \nthis probably -- or make the index post-crawl.  If you run \n./bin/arcreader, it dumps out a line per record.  You could start with \nthis.  Later you could sort them, etc.  Or, just use an instance of \nwayback and ask it which ARC the URL resides in.\nSt.Ack\n\nJean-NoÃ«l Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; My task is the following one: I need to search for a specific URL in\n&gt; the ARC file. From reading the Javadocs it seems there is no facility\n&gt; for doing this, other than iterating through ALL records and manually\n&gt; checking the URL all the time. Obviously this is not very nice from a\n&gt; performance point of view.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any alternative way of doing this? Does someone know of\n&gt; reasonably modern and maintained tool to do this, or am I just on my\n&gt; own? If I am, I would appreciate help/hints for implementing this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jean-Noel\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
