Those java tools are quite grand for such task\nand I managed to write a couple of Perl lines to count\nfile offsets =&gt; I can now read html, images etc. from \nuncompressed arc files. \n\nAll well, but one has to be very careful when reading\nbinary data from arcs. Reading one blank or linefeed\ntoo much corrupts an image, although does really nothing\nto html or text file. \n\nEven a program which retrieves data from arcs may\nadd a linefeed to a wrong place. I supppose that \nthe Danish tools are so tested that you\ncan fetch images from arcs and look at them\n\n?kaisa?\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Andrew Boyko&quot; &lt;aboy@l...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve successfully used a patched version of\n&gt; dk.netarkivet.ArcTools.ExtractCDX \n&gt; to generate Wayback-compliant CDX files from an Alexa-style DAT \nfile. \n&gt; My\n&gt; patch is attached, should it be useful to anyone.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Andy Boyko    aboy@l...\n&gt; Library of Congress - Office of Strategic Initiatives\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; lc@s... 5/3/2004 9:38:05 AM &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 2004-04-07 at 12:57, kaisa_kaunonen wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I collected a nice test archive of about 100000 docs with \n&gt; &gt; heritrix 0.6.0\n&gt; &gt; I think it went well (I didn&#39;t yet try out very baaad web sites;)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Now I try to index the archive with nwatoolset. \n&gt; &gt; At this point it seems that cdx files are needed.\n&gt; &gt; How do I generate them? \n&gt; \n&gt; To get away from the Alexa tools, which can be quite difficult to\n&gt; compile, we have developed some Java tools that are available at\n&gt; www.netarchive.dk.  They can make (unsorted) cdx files from\n&gt; (uncompressed) arc files[1], do binary searches and get entries out \nof\n&gt; arc files, and write new arc files.  They&#39;re not optimized for huge\n&gt; collections like the Alexa tools are, for instance can&#39;t handle\n&gt; multi-file cdx files yet, but we use them internally with success. \n&gt; They&#39;re all under GPL, and improvements are welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Lars\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] Actually, they do support compressed arc files, except they \ncan&#39;t\n&gt; figure out the length of the compressed entry, so they can&#39;t scan\n&gt; through them.  There&#39;s ways to do that, but I at least prefer to \njust\n&gt; not compress the files.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
