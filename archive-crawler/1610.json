First of all, the page noted to be Tom Emerson&#39;s\n&gt; solution (http://www.dreamersrealm.net/tree/blog/) doesn&#39;t seem to\n&gt; work any more. Do you have a copy of that page?\n\nUnfortunately no.  Did you see this mail sent yesterday?\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1598.\n\n&gt;   You also mentioned to add some filters in HTTP-Fetcher and\nARCWriter processors. How can I read the http header and/or the\ncontent in the\n&gt; ARCWriterProcessor?\n\nAre you trying to exclude certain mimetypes from being fetched and\nfrom being written to disk or are you trying to do something else.  If\nthe former, see the email cited above.  Else, to get at headers, you\nneed to go via the CrawlURI:\n\n((HttpMethod)curi.getObject(A_HTTP_TRANSACTION)).getResponseHeader(HEADER_NAME);\n\n... where curi is the instance of CrawlURI, A_HTTP_TRANSACTION is a\ndefine found in org.archive.crawler.datamodel.CoreAttributeConstants\nand where HEADER_NAME is name of header you are interested in: e.g.\n&quot;Server&quot;.\n\nTo get at the content, again, you&#39;d go via the CrawlURI:\n\ncuri.getHttpRecorder().getRecordedInput().getReplayInputStream()\n\n\n&gt;   In this section of the FAQ you refer to the site\n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manaul.html#midfetch .\n&gt; I would replace the string &#39;manaul&#39; to &#39;manual&#39; :)\n\nThank you for pointing this out.  Fixed.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; Bye:\n&gt; Tamas\n\n\n\n\n"}}
