It doesn&#39;t seem that the Heritrix &quot;container&quot; is\n&gt; being bound in JNDI.  I start up JBoss, then heritrix, and I can see\n&gt; +- org.archive.crawler (class: org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContext) in\n&gt; the JNDIView list method from JBoss, but there&#39;s nothing listed under\n&gt; it.  Looking into the JBoss trace logs I find only &quot;TRACE\n&gt; [org.jnp.server.NamingServer] No binding for: org.archive.crawler in\n&gt; context , bindings: ...&quot; with a list of all the root-level bindings,\n&gt; org.archive.crawler not included.  Does this have something to do with\n&gt; the javadoc for Context &quot;Binds a name to an object. All intermediate\n&gt; contexts and the target context (that named by all but terminal atomic\n&gt; component of the name) must already exist.&quot;?  Doesn&#39;t that imply we\n&gt; must do something to create the target context &quot;org.archive.crawler&quot;\n&gt; before trying to bind our &quot;container&quot; object into it?\n&gt;\n&gt; not terribly familiar with JNDI,\n&gt; eric\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Sep 11, 2006 at 02:04:11PM -0700, Michael Stack wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Hey Eric:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; hcc is all we have at the moment.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Its used at the core of our archiveit.org service coordinating a cluster \n&gt;&gt; of heterogeneous heritrix clusters.  It hasn&#39;t been getting updates of \n&gt;&gt; late because for archiveits&#39; purposes, as is, its sufficent (Launching \n&gt;&gt; and stopping of jobs, basic monitoring).  Also, the fella who was \n&gt;&gt; working on it, Danny, is gone (is going) on sabbatical.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; hcc will likely get a dusting-off one of these days.  Any controller \n&gt;&gt; application for an Heritrix cluster will likely start with this code base.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I do not see any issues with using it to launch multiple Heritrix \n&gt;&gt; instances per JVM.  As far as hcc is concerned, its all the same if its \n&gt;&gt; a Heritrix per JVM or multiple Heritrice per JVM.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; St.Ack\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Eric wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; HCC would be very useful to me, but it appears it hasn&#39;t been updated\n&gt;&gt;&gt; for a while.  What&#39;s its status, is it still the preferred way of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; launching a cluster of heritrix instances?  Is anybody using it w/ the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; latest version of heritrix?  Would it work for launching a mix of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple heritrix instances within single jvms on multiple machines?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; eric\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
