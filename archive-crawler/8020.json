Now, my thought\n&gt;&gt; was that this would restrict the crawl to URLs which have are prefixed\n&gt;&gt; with one of the seeds that I have declared earlier.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, the crawl does check outgoing links also. Again, from the\n&gt;&gt; documentation, it seemed to me that this should only happen if\n&gt;&gt; alsoCheckVia was true, in which case URLs directly referenced would be\n&gt;&gt; from a URL prefixed with a seed would also be crawled.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Have I misuderstood?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am running heritrix 3.1.1.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any of the rules that appear after the early SurtPrefixedDecideRule \n&gt; could also set the scoping decision to ACCEPT.\n&gt;\n&gt; The main other reason such extra ACCEPTs are done, in our default case \n&gt; for usual archival collection, is *transclusion*. That is, another URI \n&gt; is referred to in a way that makes the crawler believe this other URI is \n&gt; (or is likely) needed to accurately redisplay the page later.\n&gt;\n&gt; Most commonly, this is as the SRC attribute of an IMG, IFRAME, SCRIPT, \n&gt; or LINK element (but also includes URIs inferred from inside Javascript, \n&gt; where it is hard to tell if they are used for in-page updates or as \n&gt; separate navigation targets).\n&gt;\n&gt; If you don&#39;t need to fetch such resources, you can discard the \n&gt; TransclusionDecideRule, or (equivalently) set its various \n&gt; hops-to-respect-such-inclusion settings to &#39;0&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is also addresses somewhat at:\n&gt;\n&gt; https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/unexpected+offsite+content\n\nAh, of course, thank you, that helps very much indeed!\n\nPhil\n\n"}}
