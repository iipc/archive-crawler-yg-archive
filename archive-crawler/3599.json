If you are\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\ndding to the index after each crawl then, yes, it would make sense to\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nffer that option.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m doing very frequent crawls of the same sites and=\r\n have automated\n&gt; updating the deduplicator index after every crawl.

Feel free t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; send me a patch and I&#39;ll look into integrating it into the module.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; find my patch attached (the patch is against CVS Head where\nparseLinde i=\r\ns\n&gt; not static yet).\n&gt; The change in CrawlLogIterator could be more elegant=\r\n, but I didn&#39;t\nwant to\n&gt; interfere too much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings from Stockholm =\r\n& have a nice weekend,\n&gt; \n&gt; Max\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
