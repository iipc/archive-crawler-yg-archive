Wh=\r\nen I use the default settings, everything went well. However, I found that =\r\nthe local drive is not big enough so I mounted an external drive in NFS typ=\r\ne and change the &quot;heritrix.jobsdir&quot; to a directory in the NFS mounted drive=\r\n. This causes a problem as the crawler does not crawl. In &quot;state.job&quot; file,=\r\n it reports that \n\n&quot;A fatal InitializationException occured when loading jo=\r\nb:\nOn crawl: crawltest Unable to setup bdb environment.&quot;\n\nI read some posts=\r\n before and kind of get an impression that this error may be caused by usin=\r\ng an NFS mounted drive. But how to get around it? Please help.\n\n\n\n"}}
