In the FetchHTTP context you&#39;ll figure whether the \nserver has actually sent gzipped content going by its response -- see \naround line 397 -- and then, the tricky part, you&#39;ll need to gunzip \nwhats been recorded to disk after the download has completed just before \nyou leave the innerProcess method around line 485 (See HttpRecord -- \nit&#39;ll give you access to the download).\n\nLet us know if we can help,\nThanks,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
