If I already have the jar files and want to\nuse my local=\r\n copies, can I just add their location to the\nproject.properties, or do I a=\r\nlso need to add them to the project.xml file?\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; See the dependencies secti=\r\non in the project.xml.  If the xmlrpc lib is \n&gt; available up in the maven1 =\r\nibiblio repository, maven should just fetch \n&gt; it for you (You may need to =\r\nadd the following to your\nproject.properties \n&gt; file because Heritrix is st=\r\nill stuck on maven 1.0.x: \n&gt; maven.repo.remote=3Dhttp://repo1.maven.org/mav=\r\nen).\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is some more info on Heritrix and lib jars in case the above=\r\n\nproves \n&gt; insufficent.  Heritrix goes out of its way to defeat mavens depe=\r\nndency \n&gt; fetching mechanism.  It does this by setting &#39;maven.jar.override =\r\n=3D on&#39; \n&gt; in project.properties and then  mapping project.xml dependency \n=\r\n&gt; references to actual locations under the lib directory (again in \n&gt; proje=\r\nct.properties).  The thinking at the time was that the Heritrix \n&gt; checkout=\r\n contained all needed to run in the likes of eclipse.  Maven\nwas \n&gt; not req=\r\nuired (This will probably change when we move to m2).\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, for=\r\n the libidn jar, in project.xml, it looks like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt;         &lt;de=\r\npendency&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;id&gt;libidn&lt;/id&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;version&gt;0.5.9&lt;/versi=\r\non&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;url&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/&lt;/url&gt;\n&gt;         =\r\n    &lt;properties&gt;\n&gt;                 &lt;war.bundle&gt;true&lt;/war.bundle&gt;\n&gt;         =\r\n        &lt;ear.bundle&gt;true&lt;/ear.bundle&gt;\n&gt;                 &lt;ear.bundle.dir&gt;APP=\r\n-INF/lib&lt;/ear.bundle.dir&gt;\n&gt;                 &lt;description&gt;GNU Libidn is an i=\r\nmplementation of the \n&gt; Stringprep,\n&gt;                 Punycode and IDNA spe=\r\ncifications defined by the IETF\n&gt;                 Internationalized Domain =\r\nNames (IDN) working group,\nused for\n&gt;                 internationalized dom=\r\nain names.\n&gt;                 &lt;/description&gt;\n&gt;                 &lt;license&gt;GNU =\r\nLesser General Public License\n&gt;                 http://www.gnu.org/licenses=\r\n/lgpl.txt&lt;/license&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;/properties&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;/dependency&gt;\n&gt; .=\r\n..\n&gt; \n&gt; The &#39;id&#39; libidn from above is then mapped in project properties to =\r\nthe \n&gt; libidn-0.5.9.jar with the following project.properties line:\n&gt; \n&gt; ma=\r\nven.jar.libidn =3D ${basedir}/lib/libidn-0.5.9.jar\n&gt; \n&gt; You might also want=\r\n to edit .classpath so your new jar shows in eclipse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,=\r\n\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kaleb wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I need to add the Apache XMLRPC jars=\r\n to the Heritrix build, but I have\n&gt; &gt; no idea how to add these to Maven.
