Its a little dated but tells a good \nstory -- with pictures! -- about how processors work.  (Extractors are a \nspecialization of Processor).   Next study current Extractors.  There \nare a bunch to choose from: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/extractor/package-summary.html.  \nStart with the more basic -- such as \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/extractor/ExtractorXML.html \n-- and work your way up to the most awkward, HTMLExtractor.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n"}}
