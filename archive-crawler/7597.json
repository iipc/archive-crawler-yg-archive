It gets reported via the \nmethod nonseedLine() to any SurtPrefixedDecideRule that is listening to \nseed-source events for guidance. And the &#39;+&#39; means it will only be \nnoticed by such rules that are also set to ACCEPT. From previous \nmessages, I don&#39;t think your broad crawl has any such rule.\n\nWith the leading &#39;+&#39;, that URL will *not* be added as a seed and \nfetched. To add it as a seed, just have the naked URL with no &#39;+&#39;.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 1/31/12 5:19 PM, travis@... wrote:\n&gt; On Tue, January 31, 2012 4:10 pm, David Pane wrote:\n&gt;&gt; We are considering a separate crawler to crawl these seeds.
