What would be \n&gt;a good thing to do?\n&gt;\n&gt;I thought about starting by writing some junit tests, and additional \n&gt;javadoc for some low-level utility code, such as the org.archive.util \n&gt;and org.archive.crawler.util packages.  This would let me get to know \n&gt;the code a bit better. Would this be a good/useful thing to do.\n&gt;\n&gt;For you information, I&#39;m a java developer with a lot of experience of \n&gt;build systems, and testing frameworks.  (and I worked on some web \n&gt;crawler stuff a long time ago (it was in Perl in 1994 !) and have had \n&gt;interests in the area ever since.)\n&gt;\n&gt;Cheers,\n&gt;\n&gt;james.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
