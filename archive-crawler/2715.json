The \n&gt; petition may have been premature.  Since its basically working -- you \n&gt; can&#39;t add/remove/reorder filters/processors or add overrides but you can \n&gt; effect most other attributes of a running crawl, etc. -- thought is that \n&gt; requests for enhancements to JMX API should now just get filed as you \n&gt; would any other request, as an RFE against Heritrix.  A few minor ones \n&gt; are all that currently exist. \n&gt; \n&gt; You thinking something substantial John?\n\nDunno yet, but if there is the RFE route should be very helpful.\nThanks also for the background pointers!\n\n-John\n\n\n&gt; The ultimate goal is that all control goes via the one interface whether \n&gt; the local web UI or a remote cluster controller passing the config.to \n&gt; all members of a Heritrix crawling cluster.\n\n"}}
