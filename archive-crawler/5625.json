That target value is clipped \nto within the &#39;min-delay-ms&#39; and &#39;max-delay-ms&#39; range. Finally, a \n&#39;Crawl-Delay&#39;, if specified by the site&#39;s robots.txt, is applied as an \nadditional floor, up to some maximum value. It&#39;s all configurable, but \nany changes should be made with sensitivity to target sites.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nCagdas Tatlici wrote:\n&gt; Hi all, can someone please tell me the approximate delay values I\n&gt; should set to be considered polite?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; -Cagdas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
