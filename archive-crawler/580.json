Didn&#39;t look into it much because it\n&gt; wasn&#39;t urgent being able to build it on my laptop - any ideas?\n&gt; \n&gt; The other one was I tried giving heritrix lots of memory with \n&gt; JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-Xmx5120m&quot; (its an 8GB machine). It did \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Starting heritrix...&quot; add a dot every second or so - I stopped it \n&gt; after an hour or so.
