The ori=\r\nginal rationale for putting tests beside the\nclasses\ntested was to avoid ha=\r\nving to look in two places for code and as a\nconstant in-the-developers&#39;-fa=\r\nce reminder that tests need to be\nwritten.\n\nRecently Christian Kohlsch=FCtt=\r\ner proposed Heritrix do as other\nprojects\ndo and move unit tests to their o=\r\nwn directory.  In the main Christian\nargues a src tree polluted by tests is=\r\n tough to grok and that as tests\nproliferate and become more involved -- if=\r\n we start adding mock\nobjects\nand test data -- apprehension of Heritrix wor=\r\nkings will get harder\nwith\ntime.  His argument in full can be viewed here:\n=\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=3Ddeta\nil&aid=3D1187976&group=\r\n_id=3D73833&atid=3D539102.\n\nWhat do others think?\n\n(How about an apache-lik=\r\ne +1 if you agree that tests should be moved,\n-1\nif you disagree, and 0 if =\r\nneutral.  Let majority carry the motion,\nunless a minority puts up a good f=\r\night).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
