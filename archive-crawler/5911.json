For example, each record is ended with &#92;n&#92;n \n&gt; rather then &#92;r&#92;n&#92;r&#92;n.\n\ninteresting. is this really necessary?\n\n&gt; I found that the field &quot;Content-Length&quot; is always causing \n&gt; some problem. \n\nwhat is the problem exactly? do you have an error message?\n\nif the error came from a WARCReader class, it&#39;s likely from\nHeritrix common classes, which is included in NutchWAX. please\npost your question to the Heritrix &quot;archive-crawler&quot; list for\nmore help. :)\n\n&gt; I want to know how should content-Length be calcuated? I calculated it \n&gt; as the number of chracters starting from the next line of \n&gt; &quot;Conent-Length&quot; to the end of the record which is &#92;r&#92;n&#92;r&#92;n. \n\nContent-length is defined in the WARC spec as &quot;the number of\noctets in the block, similar to [RFC2616]&quot;, and the block\nis defined as part of the WARC record as follows:\n\n   warc-file    = 1*warc-record\n   warc-record  = header CRLF\n                  block CRLF CRLF\n   header       = version warc-fields\n   version      = &quot;WARC/0.1718&quot; CRLF\n   warc-fields  = *named-field CRLF\n   block        = *OCTET\n\nso i think you want to _exclude_ the CRLFs after the block.\n\nthe WARCRecord class is designed to comply with the WARC spec\nhttp://archive-access.sourceforge.net/warc/\n\nand to be compatible with WARC Tools\nhttp://code.google.com/p/warc-tools/\n\nhope that helps.\n\n\n/steve@...\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
