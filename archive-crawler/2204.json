I&#39;d guess one issue is that\nthey&#39;re usually all kept in memory as some form of Set.  The Set\nshouldn&#39;t be that big but here is where I&#39;d look first.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just hoping to get some feedback from the Heritrix pros about\nwhether\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m taking the right approach to solving my problem.  My first\ngoal is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to spider all 7 million seeds.  The second goal would be to do some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spidering of on-domain pages linked to by those seeds (to discover\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible new seeds).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your approach sounds fine to me (Gordon and Igor might have further\n&gt; &gt; suggestions). You might keep the list up to date with your crawls&#39;\nprogress.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can get to around 650k seeds before even the machine with 4G of RAM\n&gt; runs out.  Also, the speed isn&#39;t great as more seeds are added (that\n&gt; could be any number of factors).\n&gt;\nIn general, the numbers of queues and downloads are way too low for\nyou to be running out of memory.  Are you using a 64-bit JVM to get\nthe 4G of RAM?  We&#39;ve not had much success with 64-bit JVMs (Crash or\npremature run out of memory -- though SUSE with 142 is looks promising\naccording).  If a 64-bit, can you try with a 32-bit OS/JVM?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
