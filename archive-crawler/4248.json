(You could do this with your own DecideRule subclass, or \nleverage the BeanshellDecideRule to run a small script testing for the \nmalware AList attribute.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; badswalu\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I am confused by meanings of &quot;document&quot; and &quot;just a url&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; Could you please clarify what those two mean?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; badswalu wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all, I need some advice on how to have heritrix use two writers\n&gt;&gt;&gt; depending on whether a document is found.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Meaning if heritrix found a document then I want to use writer1 and if\n&gt;&gt;&gt; its just a url then I want to use writer2.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I was thinking maybe something like this:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; public DeciderWriter {\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; if document found\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     writer1.innerProcess();\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; else its a url\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     writer2.innerProcess();\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; }\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks to whomever can help,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; badswalu\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
