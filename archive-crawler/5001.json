(There are now direct help links from individual web UI \nsettings to actual or potential wiki pages.)\n\nQuestions and discussion are as always welcome on the project discussion\nlist:\n\narchive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/\n\nBugs and enhancement requests may be entered in the JIRA project issue\ntracker:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
