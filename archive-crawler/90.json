However, there was a bug in the robots.txt \nfile rather than the Heritrix crawler code.  Thus, the Heritrix crawler \nseems to be operating correctly.  \n\nHeritrix Got Mercator Did Not\n-----------------------------\nMercator did not find a page where there were spaces in the \nfilename.  It seems to have chopped off the rest of the filename after the \nspace, and when Mercator tried to find that file, it resulted in a 404:\nMercator\ncrawl08.archive.org/links/spaces\nHeritrix\ncrawl08.archive.org/links/spaces%20in%20path.html\nThis page was the only valid page that Heritrix got that Mercator did not.  \n\nOther Pages\n---------------\nThe remaining pages that Heritrix got that Mercator and HTTrack did not, \nall returned 404 response codes.  Furthermore, the one page difference \nbetween Mercator and HTTrack was that HTTrack got the robots.txt file and Mercator did not.\n\nOverall, Heritrix seems to be doing well in terms of coverage of the \nEasyGarden. \n\n\nJudy\n\n\n"}}
