Packaging has also \nbeen improved. See the Release Notes for more detail on changes (and \ncurrent known limitations) at \nhttp://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wera/articles/releasenotes.html. \nAlso, with release 0.4.0, WERA has migrated from its old home in the \nNWAToolset at nwa.nb.no to a subproject of \narchive-access.sourceforge.net.  The WERA home page is at: \nhttp://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wera/.\n\nRelease 0.4.0 of NutchWAX includes lots of bug fixes and has been built \nagainst release 0.7 of nutch. Again see the release notes for details:\nhttp://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/nutch/articles/releasenotes.html.   \nFor the NutchWAX home page, see: \nhttp://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/nutch/.\n\nA demo of WERA+NutchWAX in operation can be found at \nhttp://nwa.nb.no/wera/.\n\nYours,\nSverre Bang and Michael Stack\n\n"}}
