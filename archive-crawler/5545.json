(In particular, KeyWordUriPrecedencePolicy \njust lets any non-zero pre-set URI precedence stand, and only resets an \nunset 0 precedence to the base value... so you could use it with way #2 \nabove.)\n\nSorry that the precedence documentation remains thin; I presume you&#39;ve \nalready found the high-level notes at:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Precedence+Feature+Notes\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nnfoscarini wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I really need some help, because I think I&#39;m stuck in Heritrix 2.0.1.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to crawl a list of seeds, and any URI that contains a keyword I\n&gt; want to rank it&#39;s queue-precedence value to 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my global sheet I added a BaseQueuePrecedencePolicy, and set the\n&gt; base-precedence value to &quot;5&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I then created a new sheet called &quot;contacts only&quot;, and I changed the\n&gt; base-precedence value to &quot;1&quot;. I want to apply a rule for URIs that\n&gt; have the keyword &quot;contact&quot; to this new base-precedence value. So that\n&gt; they are crawled first.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s where I&#39;m kind of stuck? How do I apply a filter rule to the\n&gt; &quot;contacts only&quot; sheet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible to add a regular expression to the SURTs list for a sheet?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can I add a filter or scope rule that is applied to the sheet?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
