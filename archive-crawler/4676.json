Is is supposed to display\n&gt;  &gt; &#39;Heritrix(-1)-Domain unresolvable&#39; if the &#39;Seed has not been processed\n&gt;  &gt; yet&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Unless this is happening repeatedly, it could just be a transient or\n&gt;  local DNS problem at the time of the initial try.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If this is so is the reason that it still states the above due to the\n&gt;  &gt; large queue (1106246 queued) that needs to be processed first before\n&gt;  &gt; addressing the new seed items?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Unlikely. Each host gets its own queue, and DNS entries are placed in\n&gt;  front of everything else on that queue. If many other hosts are in\n&gt;  progress (monopolizing all the worker threads), the new seeds might not\n&gt;  be tried at all for a while -- but also would not show as any error.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Looking at the code, I can&#39;t see a path that could result in both\n&gt;  &#39;Heritrix(-1)-Domain unresolvable&#39; and &#39;Seed has not been processed yet&#39;\n&gt;  displaying for the same seed, nor can I reproduce by trying to crawl a\n&gt;  made-up unregistered domain.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Are both these messages appearing for the same seed? Have you changed\n&gt;  anything in your crawler, especially with regard to the\n&gt;  PreconditionEnforcer or FetchDNS processor modules?\n&gt;\n&gt;  - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;  \n\n"}}
