Can we get the latest Heritrix running in jdk1.4.2? What changes \n&gt; are needed? If that is not possible, pls go to question 2.\n\nWe started using JDK1.5 features after the Heritrix 1.8.0 release.\n\nGetting the latest release (1.10.1) or CVS HEAD to work in JDK 1.4.2 \nshould be possible but it would take some significant effort, and you&#39;d \nbe off the mainline for fixes and features.\n\n&gt; 2. What is the latest version of Heritrix that can be run in jdk1.4.2? \n&gt; Does that version have a lot of bugs?\n\nAs noted above, 1.8.0.\n\nLots of big and successful crawls were done with 1.8.0 and earlier \nversions, but it had bugs and other limitations since fixed. See the \nissue tracking at Sourceforge or release notes (at \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/releasenotes/ ) for details.\n\nIt would depend a lot on your aims. You could also consider keeping the \ncrawling functionality in a separate JVM, remote-controlled by the other \napplication, if that application is forced to stay in JDK1.4.2.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Thanks a lot,\n&gt; Tim\n\n"}}
