The very latest H3 development\n&gt;&gt; builds are available from the new Jenkins-based build box, accessible\n&gt;&gt; for now at:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; https://ia410225.us.archive.org:1443/\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Generally if you would have been comfortable with the 3.1.0-beta a\n&gt;&gt; 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT would be appropriate too (and we always appreciate the\n&gt;&gt; help testing the latest code in preparation for an official release).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this the last version available? With subversion I downloaded heritrix3, is it older than heritrix 1.14.4?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Why are two numbering sequences being used? I mean &quot;heritrix 1, 2, 3&quot; and then also &quot;heritrix 1.14.3, 1.14.4....&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Roughly changes to the leading digit (eg &quot;1.&quot;, &quot;2.&quot;, &quot;3.&quot; aka &quot;major\n&gt;&gt; version&quot;) mean there are big, backward incompatible changes that users\n&gt;&gt; of previous editions will want to understand before upgrading. Changes\n&gt;&gt; to the second digit (eg &quot;1.12&quot;, &quot;1.14&quot;, &quot;3.0&quot;, &quot;3.1&quot; aka &quot;minor\n&gt;&gt; version&quot;) indicate some new functionality but generally painless\n&gt;&gt; transitions forward if you familiarize yourself with the Release Notes\n&gt;&gt; for the releases between what you&#39;re using and what you&#39;re moving to.\n&gt;&gt; Changes to the third digit (eg &quot;1.14.1&quot;, &quot;1.14.2&quot;, &quot;1.14.3&quot; aka &quot;micro&quot;\n&gt;&gt; or &quot;patch&quot; or &quot;point release&quot;) mean mostly fixes and small changes, and\n&gt;&gt; often (but unfortunately not always) configurations can be brought\n&gt;&gt; forward with no conscious effort.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even as later major versions are developed, some people can&#39;t move right\n&gt;&gt; away, so small fix point releases will continue on the earlier major\n&gt;&gt; version. (Heritrix 2 went through a second major configuration change\n&gt;&gt; after its first release, but before any widespread adoption, so\n&gt;&gt; essentially everyone using Heritrix should be on either 1.14.x or 3.0+\n&gt;&gt; and no other H2 point releases are expected.) Our expected next few\n&gt;&gt; official releases are:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 3.1.0 final\n&gt;&gt; 1.14.5\n&gt;&gt; 3.1.1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There will probably eventually be a 1.14.6 if institutions keep using it\n&gt;&gt; and there are necessary fixes that accumulate, but there probably won&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; be a 1.16.0.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At this point, people starting fresh who can handle XML-based\n&gt;&gt; configuration editing, or people doing their own code customizations in\n&gt;&gt; Java, are urged to start with a Heritrix 3 release. People on projects\n&gt;&gt; that already have experience with Heritrix 1 and are used-to or more\n&gt;&gt; comfortable with its form-fields-based configuration can wait until they\n&gt;&gt; feel they need something in H3.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am going crazy with the gzip problem: I cannot get nutchwax to import any arc produced by heritrix. Is this gzip problem solved in 3.1.0? I am using jdk1.6.0_25\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The latest dev builds (including 3.1.0-beta and the 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\n&gt;&gt; builds on the new build machine referenced above) have a workaround for\n&gt;&gt; the GZIP-reading issues introduced by JDK6u23-and-above. If you can get\n&gt;&gt; your nutchwax version to use the latest (W)ARC-reading code, which may\n&gt;&gt; take a little work, it should resolve your issues. Or, you could go back\n&gt;&gt; to JDK6u22 or earlier.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanx in advance to anyone who might help.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Nacho\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
