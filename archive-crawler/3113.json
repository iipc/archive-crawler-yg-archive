So anyone having any ideas? I can&#39;t add filters for the\nE=\r\nxtractorHTML so the only option I&#39;d see so far is changing its code\nto not =\r\nextract stuff from a robots.txt. If anyone has a better idea\nI&#39;d be interes=\r\nted to hear.\n\nThanks in advance\n  Olaf Freyer\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
