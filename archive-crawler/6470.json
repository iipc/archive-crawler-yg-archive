Luckily extended by &quot;msgtype&quot;. Nevertheless the\n &gt; ArchiveRecordHeader says nothing about its &quot;payload&quot; and if only feeding\n &gt; say &quot;text/html&quot; I have to also analyze the content of the record.\n &gt;\n &gt; 1) why this change?\n\nthe ARC format contains only HTTP responses. the WARC format contains\na richer set of metadata, including HTTP request records. original\nHTTP Content-Type fields are included in the payload of &quot;WARC-Type:\nresponse&quot; records.\n\n &gt; 2) why not naming the &quot;Content-Type&quot; of the header &quot;WARC-Content-Type&quot;\n &gt; and also for &quot;WARC-Content-Length&quot;?\n\ni&#39;m not sure, but perhaps it is intended to be apparent that the\nContent-Type found in the WARC header applies to the WARC record,\nwhile the content type in the payload (if extant) applies to the\npayload, and likewise for Content-Length. also, there may be some\ndesire to be name-consistent with the referenced RFCs.\n\nperhaps Heritrix could make it easier to get at the underlying\ncontent type of a response record in WARCs by adding a\npayload-content-type accessor to ArchiveRecordHeader, which\nis not defined for ARCs. however, this might be a slippery slope.\nwhat other payload fields might we want accessors for? is this\nproblem better solved by just peeking into the payload?\n\n &gt; 3) while having a &quot;WARC-Payload-Digest&quot;, why not having a\n &gt; &quot;WARC-Payload-Content-Type&quot;?\n\nthis might be considered redundant with Content-Type found in HTTP\nresponse headers when extant, and fulfilled by the Content-Type of the\nWARC header when not.\n\nplease feel free to also post your questions about the WARC\nspecification to the &quot;WARC Tools&quot; group as well.\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/warc-tools\n\nhope that helps.\n\n\n/steve@...\n\n\n &gt; Best regards\n &gt; Bernd\n\n"}}
