Is there any garantee that the two seeds w=\r\nill be crawled &#39;efficiently&#39;? (i.e. that the quota will not be only used fo=\r\nr one of them.)\n\nFrom what I understand Heritrix could crawl the first seed=\r\n, go over quota and then try the next one but it would be too late. (Assumi=\r\nng that force retire is set to false.)\n\nAs a practical example, the two see=\r\nds could be\nhttp://yahoo.com/business/\nhttp://yahoo.com/mobile/\nIn that fic=\r\ntional case, we would want to crawl only the business and mobile parts of t=\r\nhe yaho.com site but not the whole domain (which could be very huge).\n\nIs t=\r\nhat a scenario that is likely to happens? What would be the best way(s) to =\r\nprevent it?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nBertrand Dechoux\n\n\n"}}
