(Hi, everyone at the workshop!)  In \nthat vein, I&#39;ve got a few questions about the default configuration \nvalues, towards making the crawler most useful right out of the box.\n\n- Invocation: it seems pretty clear that crawls are safest with some \nmemory headroom.  Can the bin/heritrix script default JAVA_OPTS to \n&quot;-Xmx256m&quot; if it&#39;s not otherwise set?\n\n- Extractors: how experimental are the non-enabled variants?  I recall \nthat in February, we were encouraged to use HTML2 and CSS, but that some \nleaked memory (PDF?  DOC?  SWF?).  Is it safe to change the defaults to, \nat the least, include CSS?  Of the potentially leaky ones, SWF seems the \nmost compelling for enabling by default.\n\n- Filters: If I understand the &quot;recheck-scope&quot; setting on the \npreselector, it needs to be set for scope changes during the crawl to be \ndetected and honored.  Assuming it doesn&#39;t affect performance too much, \ncan it default to on?\n\nIs it worthwhile to enable by default either PathDepth or \nPathologicalPath filters, presumably with generous but non-infinite values?\n\n- Politeness: I know per-host bandwidth usage got moved to the &quot;expert&quot; \nsection, but it might be good to default the per-host cap to something \nmaybe T1-like (thus, perhaps 150KBps or so) to avoid pummelling sites \nwith large files, when crawling from a large pipe.  (Is the per-host cap \nlike the total-bandwidth cap, in that it doesn&#39;t actually constrain \ninstantaneous traffic, only the average?)\n\nAt any rate, it&#39;s clear there&#39;s not a lot between here and 1.0 (but \nplease see the bug I submitted today :) Thanks for the great work and \nbreakneck pace, Heritrix-meisters!\n\nRegards,\nAndy Boyko   aboy@...\nLibrary of Congress\n\n"}}
