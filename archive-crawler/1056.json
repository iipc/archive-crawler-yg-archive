The log \n&gt;files where full of too many files open errors. I had \n&gt;hit about 12000 unique domains ( I was gathering URLS to\n&gt;test a consistent hash algorithm). \n&gt;\n&gt;I seem to be able to reproduce this consistently - is this \n&gt;a know bug or is there a setting I can change to help it?\n&gt;\n&gt;cheers \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHeyup Mark.\n\nOn the too many open files, checkout the FAQ.  You&#39;ll have to boost your\n\nlimit if you&#39;re doing broad crawls:  \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/faq.html#toomanyopenfiles.  You might want to\n\nalso check the Known Limitations doc. if you haven&#39;t already since \nyou&#39;re trying broad crawls:  \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/limitations.html.\n\nHope that helps some.\nGood on you  Mark,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;mark \n&gt;\n&gt;***********************************************************************\n***\n&gt;\n&gt;Experience the British Library online at www.bl.uk \n&gt;\n&gt;Help the British Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
