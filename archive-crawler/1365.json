Thus\nyou could not only make the crawl uri pass information from one\nprocessor to the next, but a parent URI could pass information to\nchild URIs.\n\nFor adaptive focused crawling, it is very helpful to be able to pass\nmiscellaneous information from parent pages to children.\n\nIn Heritrix, I can see where attributes could be copied into child\nURIs -- in the handleLinkCollection method of the Postselector class, \nfor example, when the CandidateURI is formed.  So I would like to\nextend Postselector and over-ride just this one method, but it is\nprivate.\n\nHow do you all decide which methods to make protected and which\nprivate?  Maybe it would be nice to allow the application programmer\nto add attributes to the CandidateURI before it goes onto the\nfrontier, perhaps by some call-back or by factoring out a protected\nand over-ridable method that decorates the CandidateURI.\n\nOr perhaps there is some better way to add historical information to\ncandidate URIs before the parent CrawlURI is lost forever and before\nthe child CandidateURIs are added to the frontier?\n\nThanks for any thoughts/info before I go copying humongous swatches of\ncode out of the Postselector into my own custom Postselector.\n\nD.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
