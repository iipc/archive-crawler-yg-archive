Its got holes in it.  We \ncan add to it as we get more practise releasing.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\nMAKING A HERITRIX RELEASE\n              \nBefore making a release, its assumed that the current HEAD version has \nbeen run through the (as yet non-existent) test suite to ensure HEAD is \nrelease worthy.\n\n1. Send a mail to the list to stop commits until the all-clear is \ngiven.                                                              \n2. Change the project.xml &#39;currentVersion&#39; element (See &quot;Version and \nRelease Numbering&quot; for guidance on what version number to use).\n3. Get maven to generate a new build.xml file:\n                                                                                \n\n    % $MAVEN_HOME/bin/maven ant\n                                                                                \n\n4. Compare the newly generated build.xml to the one in cvs.  Patch the \nnew file so it picks up the required modifications that are in CVS such \nas the adding of &#39;source=&quot;1.4&quot;&#39; to jar and javac producer targets, etc.\n5. Make the maven distributions:\n                                                                                \n\n   % $MAVEN_HOME/bin/maven dist\n                                                                                \n\n6. Build the src version using both maven and ant.\n7. Run both the binary and src-built product through the (as yet \nnon-existent) test suite.\n8. Update changes.xml.\n9. Update the README.txt (Perhaps we should be copying the changes in \nhere so they are available in the base of the heritrix bundle).\n10. Tag the CVS repository:\n   \n    % cvs -q tag heritrix-?_?_?\n\n11. Update the project.xml &#39;currentVersion&#39; incrementing the version \nnumber beyond that of the release currently being made (If we&#39;re \nreleasing 0.2.0, then increment to 0.3.0).\n12. Login and upload the maven &#39;dist&#39; product to sourceforge into the \nadmin-&gt;File releases section.\n13. Update news on website, send announcement to mailinglist -- and an \nall-clear that commits may resume -- and update our release state on \nfreshmeat site (Here is the URL I used creating our freshmeat project: \nhttp://freshmeat.net/add-project/all-done/43820/46804/).\n\n\n\n"}}
