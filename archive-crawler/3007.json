However, I want to\n&gt; be able to crawl all the pages discovered from a seed before moving on\n&gt; to the next seed.  How can I make those discovered pages move up the\n&gt; queue in front of the seeds?\n\nIn general &#39;embeds&#39; (things necessary to render a page) are \nfetched ASAP after their containing page, before other \nalready-waiting pages. But, this would not include other linked \npages, which go to the back of the queue.\n\nI can&#39;t think of a way to achieve exactly what you want with \nstandard Heritrix options/settings. I think it would take some \nhacking at the code.\n\n(A possible approach would be to give all discovered URIs the same \n&#39;scheduling directive&#39; that currently only embeds get. Embeds get \ntheir escalation in AbstractFrontier.applySpecialHandling(); a \nsimilar esclation is done in LinksScoper.handlePrerequisite(), and \nLinksScoper might be the best place to do blanket \nscheduled-in-front directives.)\n\nSeparately, Heritrix does not yet handle very large seed lists \ngracefully -- over a certain size, you can&#39;t enter (or view) them \nthrough the web UI. But, you can still launch jobs with \nmulti-hundred-thousand seed lists via the command line.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
