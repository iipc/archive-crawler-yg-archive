So I need it\na) =\r\nto detect cross-domain-hops\nb) no to apply on root-level redirects\n\nYou mig=\r\nht wonder about the purpose of such a rule? This rule should\nmake sure, tha=\r\nt I crawl each domain only from the base seed I provide\n(and thus can guara=\r\nntee a given hop-depth). Otherwise a link might\nredirect me deep into a sit=\r\ne to a place I&#39;m not interested in.\n\nI would be happy if anyone could give =\r\nme some hints about how to\nimplement something alike\n\nRegards\n  Olaf Freyer=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
