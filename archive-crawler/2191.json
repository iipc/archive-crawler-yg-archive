I just started the job and I&#39;ll keep=\r\n y&#39;all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; apprised of the memory situation as it runs.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Before ru=\r\nnning out of memory, the final statiscal count was 151889\n&gt; &gt; downloads out=\r\n of 4473197 potential (the bar graph on the summary\n&gt; &gt; page).\n&gt; \n&gt; That is=\r\n a small number of downloads.  I&#39;m guessing whats killing you is\n&gt; the numb=\r\ner of queues.  Whats the frontier report say about queues?\n\nSorry.  I neede=\r\nd to do other work on the machine in the meantime and I\nran some other jobs=\r\n, so I don&#39;t believe I have access to the frontier\nqueue anymore (am I wron=\r\ng?).\n\n&gt; Did you use the suggested alternate queue policy so there isn&#39;t a q=\r\nueue\n&gt; per host?\n\nI did, in fact.\n\n&gt; You could also set the hold-queues to =\r\nbe true so that heritrix focuses\n&gt; on a server giving it a chance to crawl =\r\na queue to completion.\n\nIn the new run, its setup this way.\n\n&gt; &gt; The proble=\r\nm, as I see it, is that the 4.4M number should never\n&gt; &gt; have been that hig=\r\nh.  After I loaded the 1.1M seeds, the number of\n&gt; &gt; potential pages was ar=\r\nound twice that (I&#39;m guessing because of DNS?).\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah.  And robots.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Because the attempt was to configure Heritrix to not download any\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nages but the seeds, clearly something has gone wrong.  The extra\n&gt; &gt; pages =\r\nbeing scheduled is what is driving the memory needs up.\n&gt; \n&gt; See above.\n\nI =\r\njust re-ran the job and noticed that my &quot;rejecthops&quot; rule is not\nworking co=\r\nrrectly.  While it is PASS&#39;ing on some URL&#39;s that were not\npart of the orig=\r\ninal file (incorrect), it is REJECT&#39;ing others\n(correct).  The only reason =\r\nI can think that it should be PASS&#39;ing\nsome (besides a bug in either my con=\r\nfiguration or Heritrix) is because\nof a redirection which might be consider=\r\ned analogous to the original\nurl passed in through importUris.  Does that m=\r\nake sense?\n\nWhat&#39;s the PrerequisiteAcceptRule do?  My TooManyHopsDecideRule=\r\n is set\nat 1.  Should it be set at 0?\n\nThanks for your continued help.\n\n-ma=\r\ntt\n\n"}}
