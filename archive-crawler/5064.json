I intended to log the links not harvested because \n&gt; of reaching the maximum set distance from seed.\n\nFollowing nfoscarini&#39;s message, I went looking for places this status \ncode would be set -- and couldn&#39;t find any. I believe it is left over \nfrom older versions of Heritrix and is no longer used.\n\nTo achieve your stated goal, I would look mostly at LinksScoper. It will \nlog at &#39;INFO&#39; level any scope-rejected URIs that are not also rejected \nby the optional set of additional DecideRules.\n\nYou can use Java properties to set the LinksScoper class logging level \nto INFO, and even to redirect its logging to a separate log file -- \nusing standard Java logging control (nothing special to Heritrix).\n\nWith a typical scopes, many URIs would be rejected for reasons other \nthan too-many-hops, and these would show up in the log as well. With \nsome custom DecideRules, you could fix this.\n\nPerhaps you would only log those which exceed your hops-count (creating \na DecideRule in the LinksScoper &#39;rejectlog-decide-rules&#39; that is the \nexact opposite of the one in your scope). This would still log some URIs \nthat were REJECTed for other reasons (like off-focus or \nbad-URI-patterns) in addition to too-many hops.\n\nTo log exactly those that were REJECTed for too-many-hops, and nothing \nelse, would require your scope rule to be a special version of \ntoo-many-hops, that marks up the CrawlURI when it is REJECTed. Then your \nlater logging-limiting DecideRule could only log those so marked.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
