After \nthat point, the file is not consulted.\n\nSo, when wanting to change a running crawl, you have a few options:\n\n� for simple values that are consulted constantly during the crawl, you \ncan use the web UI&#39;s &#39;bean browse&#39; function to browse to the relevant \ncomponent, and edit the value. It&#39;s best to pause the crawl (though many \nvalues are safe to edit in a running crawl)). Note that some values may \nonly take effect during steps at the beginning of a crawl; in general \nyou need to try-and-observe-results or consult the source code. If you \nwant to be sure future relaunches reflect the change, change the \ncrawler-beans.cxml as well.\n\n� for both simple values and the installation/replacement of more \ncomplicated components, you can use the &#39;scripting console&#39; to run short \nbits of Beanshell/Groovy/Javascript (or even JRuby or Jython code if \nyou&#39;ve arranged for that to be available). The same caveats as above \napply and then some: if you don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re doing you could \neasily corrupt things.\n\n� Pause, checkpoint, discard the crawl; modify the crawler-beans.cxml; \nthen resume-from-checkpoint. You&#39;re then certain the resumed crawl&#39;s \nconfiguration is reflected in the crawler-beans.cxml. (At the cost of \nthe extra overhead/output-artifacts and slight downtime, you get a \nbetter audit-trail/reproducibility.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon\n\n\nOn 2/11/13 3:05 AM, Elverton wrote:\n&gt; Hello everybody,\n&gt;\n&gt; My doubt is about editing a job that is already running.\n&gt; It&#39;s only &quot;pause&quot; and edit the crawler-beans manually or have I\n&gt; do something else?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve search in H3&#39;s page and I don&#39;t get it right.
