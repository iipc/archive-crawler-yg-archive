Bloom \nbecomes =\r\n\n&gt; saturated at 125million so thats about the upperbound per machine at \nth=\r\ne \n&gt; moment unless you up the bloom filter size  (but its already big and \n=\r\n&gt; you&#39;ll start eating into heap the crawler is using going about its \nother=\r\n \n&gt; business).  Thereafter the rate of false positives -- reports that \nwe&#39;=\r\nve \n&gt; seen an URL when in fact we haven&#39;t -- starts to increase (Read the \n=\r\n&gt; BloomFilter javadoc for more on its workings).\n&gt; \n\nHow confident do you g=\r\nuys feel that if I use broad-scope I can go \nabove 50M links (or even 100M =\r\nlinks) without OOME on a single machine? \nThat to me that seems to be the d=\r\neciding factor on whether we should \nstart with 5 beefy machines and hope e=\r\nach one can go up to 100M links, \nor with 10 less beefy machines and each o=\r\nne can go up to 50M links \nwithout OOME.\n\nI know I&#39;m shooting darts in the =\r\ndark now...I have to start the \nproject planning soon so I&#39;d like to take m=\r\ny best guess with all the \nadvices I can get.\n\ncheers,\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
