The results of the DNS lookup would be\nlogged into the same archival files as HTTP results. \n\nThis would also challenge us early-on to make the main worker-thread\nloop capable of handling non-HTTP URIs in a sensible way. We\nmight find the same retry policies can apply across different\nprotocols, or that custom retry policies are necessary.\n\nReddy, I&#39;d like you to update your &quot;DNS Revisit&quot; plans to take\ninto account this approach. We can discuss in the call tonight.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
