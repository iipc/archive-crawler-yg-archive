I am having trouble deciding whe=\r\nre the best place to do this is.  Also, is \nit possible to modify the uri o=\r\nnce it has been created?  \n\nThe other question I have is if the bdbfrontier=\r\n keeps a record of all crawluris that could be \nused after the crawl has be=\r\nen completed.  I would like to generate a final report after the \ncrawl has=\r\n finished and I wanted to avoid having to read back in the logs I already g=\r\nenerated.\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n-Sam\n\n\n"}}
