I can&#39;t connect via =\r\neither the\n&gt; &gt; JConsole application nor the command line also.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nprocess is that I have 10 heritrix instances up (within the one\n&gt; &gt; jvm) an=\r\nd I look for an available crawler mbean (via a jmx query) when\n&gt; &gt; a job ne=\r\neds to be submitted.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of any issues like this?
