Can you first give me \nfeedback on the below?\n\n+ &quot;Error: Invalid Crawler Supplied&quot; whenever I tried &#39;creating test set&#39; \n(Selected &#39;heritrix&#39;, then filled out next screen variously -- if I left \nit empty or filled in a bunch of text it still gave me the error \nmessage).  This stops me being able to use the tool (Yesterday it seemed \nto work -- it at least generated a seed url for me).\n+ Title is also misspelled on home page.\n+ I added a crawler.  Its named heritrix too but had a different \nversion.  In drop down it only shows the crawler name, not version, so \nits hard for me to distingush between the two.\n+ I see on disk and in your commit of last night that tests on the \nfilesystem are named &#39;test1&#39;, &#39;test3&#39; etc.  Do they have to be named \nso?  Could they have more meaningful names so the &#39;background image \nextraction&#39; test (test1) was  contained in a directory named \n&#39;bkgrd_image_extraction&#39; or some such.\n+ Whats &#39;webroot&#39; in the &#39;Add Test&#39; page?\n\nThanks Parker,\nSt.Ack\n\n\nParker Thompson wrote:\n\n&gt;Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m (I think) ready to get that crawler testing stuff into CVS.  I wanted \n&gt;to send out that link I promised (long ago) to the existing version, and \n&gt;ask you to look it over:\n&gt;\n&gt;  http://parkert.com/crawlertest/\n&gt;\n&gt;I still haven&#39;t got the htaccess tests implemented, but didn&#39;t want this\n&gt;to stall any longer, and everything else should (in theory) be fine.  But \n&gt;I suspect if you bang on this there&#39;s still a bug or two to be found.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt;pt.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
