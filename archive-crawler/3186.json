Intent is to refactor Heritrix code base into smaller, more \ncoherent pieces.  We&#39;ve been talking about it for a while now.\n\nCurrently, the archive-commons jar is made from the heritrix.jar using \nautojar (Seen the $HERITRIX_HOME/maven.xml for the autojar goal for how \nthis is done).  Its done as part of the continuous build process.  \narchive-commons.jar has in it the ARC reading and writing classes, our \nsubclasses of the apache commons-httpclient URI class, and general \nutility from Heritrix all out of the org.archive package (nothing from \norg.archive.crawler package).  The archive-commons jar is then included \nin projects that juggle ARC files such as nutchwax and open source wayback.\n\nAhead of the breakup of the monolithic Heritrix jar, we should probably \nmove from Maven 1.0.2 to Maven 2.0.  Maven 2.0 seems to like aggregating \nlots of small coherent jars to make up a big package, much more so than \n1.0.2.  We&#39;ll have to move source directories around inside the Heritrix \nsource tree to make dedicated subprojects to build the likes of an \narchive-commons.jar and then a smaller Heritrix jar that has dependency \non the former.  So we can have a history of the source code moves, and \nhopefully, so we can keep our CVS commit history, we&#39;ll preceed all by a \nmove to subversion.\n\nThe above changes are large enough.  They should probably be done to \ncoincide with release of Heritrix 2.0.  We need to work it into our plan \n(http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?HeritrixRoadmapFor2006).  \nWill update the list when we&#39;ve figured more on the above.\n\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; S�ren Vejrup Carlsen, Digital Bevaring, Det Kongelige Bibliotek\n&gt; tlf: (+45) 33 47 48 41\n&gt; email: svc@... &lt;mailto:svc%40kb.dk&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Non omnia possumus omnes\n&gt; --- Macrobius, Saturnalia, VI, 1, 35 -------\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
