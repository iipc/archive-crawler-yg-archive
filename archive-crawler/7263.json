(The easiest way to get at it is to \ncreate a new job.) The other one that used to be in there was merely a \nredundant copy. See https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1856\n\nThanks for reporting that obsolete setting commented out in the default \nconfig. It&#39;s gone now - \nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/source/changelog/HER/?cs=7233\n\nNormally we update the default cxml whenever we make settings changes in \nthe code. This one was an oversight.\n\nNoah\n\nOn 08/08/2011 08:35 AM, kristsi25 wrote:\n&gt; I ran our latest .is domain crawl using 3.1-RC1 and can say that it is definitely an improvement on 3.0 in terms of stability.\n&gt;\n&gt; I found no regressions, except that there doesn&#39;t seem to be a sample profile included anymore. Given that profiles from 3.0 need to be updated in several areas, this is an issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; I did find a sample profile in the source code, but even that is (somewhat) incorrect as it still shows &quot;holdQueues&quot; to be a valid setting for BdbFrontier (is present but commented out, implying that you can uncomment if you want non-default behavior). This setting has however been removed (perhaps moved elsewhere?).\n&gt;\n&gt; Other, commented out, features should probably be reviewed to ensure they are still valid.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Kristinn\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Noah Levitt&lt;nlevitt@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt; A new test release of Heritrix before our final 3.1.0 release is now\n&gt;&gt; available.
