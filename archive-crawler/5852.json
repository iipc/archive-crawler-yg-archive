My seed list contains a single domain like:\n\nhttp://www.targetdomain.tld\n\nAccording to the docs, the crawl scope &quot;DomainScope&quot; is deprecated and \n&quot;DecidingScope&quot; should be used instead. My decide-rules are, in order:\n\nRejectDecideRule\nOnDomainsDecideRule\nMatchesFilePatternDecideRule\nPrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule\n\nAs I understand it, RejectDecideRule sets the decision to REJECT, which \nbeing first on list serves as a default action. OnDomains returns ACCEPT \nif a sub-domain of the domains in the seed list, else PASS. My Matches \nfile patterns is:\n\n*(?i)(&#92;.(doc|pdf|ppt|swf|js|css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif))$\n\nand returns REJECT on a match.\n\nI believe the prerequisite rule is required for DNS, robots.txt (the job \ndoesn&#39;t seem to run without it). I am writing out using \nMirrorWriterProcessor.\n\nNow the crawl seems to work _reasonably_ well - e.g no images, pdfs, or \ncontent from other domains etc. However, I still get a .css or two and \nalso a number of javascript files (particularly scriptaculous stuff)\n\nCould it be that these stray css, js are somehow &quot;Prerequisites&quot; - and \nso are being ACCEPTED? If so why is that and what can I do to eliminate \nthem? Or is there some other possible explanation?\n\nThanks very much,\n\nRichard.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
