After this time heritrix unexpectedly crash with this message in heritrix_out.log\n&gt; \n&gt; #\n&gt; # An unexpected error has been detected by Java Runtime Environment:\n&gt; #\n&gt; #  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00002aaaab4c4200, pid=18147, tid=1087596896\n&gt; #\n&gt; # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (11.0-b15 mixed mode linux-amd64)\n&gt; # Problematic frame:\n&gt; # v  ~BufferBlob::jni_fast_GetIntField\n&gt; #\n&gt; # An error report file with more information is saved as:\n&gt; # /mnt/pole-b/heritrix/hs_err_pid18147.log\n&gt; #\n&gt; # If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit:\n&gt; #   http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport/crash.jsp\n&gt; # The crash happened outside the Java Virtual Machine in native code.\n&gt; # See problematic frame for where to report the bug.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using\n&gt; heritrix 1.14.2\n&gt; java 64b - 1.6.0_10\n&gt; debian\n&gt; \n&gt; How can I avoid this type of error? This one wasn&#39;t so critical as it can be in large crawl because I intend to end this crawl soon.\n\nThis looks like the same issue as discussed in this previous message:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/5859\n\nIncreasing the &#39;ulimit -n&#39; open-file limit *may* help, but also getting \nto the JVM versioned 1.6.0_14 should address the underlying Java bug.\n\n&gt; Second thing I have on my mind. Can I just rename arc.gz.open files to arc.gz and use it for indexing?\n\nFor the most part, yes. However, because the crash may have occurred \nmidway through writing a record, the last record may be incomplete \n(either as a record or a gzip compression envelope). Usually later \nindexing steps are robust against such corruption, but the best practice \nis probably to validate the ARC and truncate-away any incomplete final \nrecord before &#39;sealing&#39;/ingesting the ARC.\n\nWe have a legacy tool (not part of the open-source packages) that does \nthis for ARCs but not WARCs, but it should be easy to make a tool, \neither from the ARCReading functionality (such as by using a CDX \nindex-of-records to identify the last good record, and discarding areas \nafterward) or even from gzip tools (to find and discard the \nlast/incomplete gzip envelope).\n\nI&#39;ve made an issue to track the idea such a tool should be part of the \ncrawler, HER-1647. We&#39;d welcome a contribution, if anyone has working \nshell/Java code for doing this.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
