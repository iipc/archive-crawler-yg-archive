(Is ACCEPT\n&gt;&gt; like &#39;true&#39; or REJECT like &#39;true&#39;? I think depends on whether you&#39;re\n&gt;&gt; ruling things in or out at that point.)\n&gt; \n&gt; My thought process was as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Decide rules have two functions: first, rule in/out (a.k.a. match),\n&gt;    where rule out=PASS (=NONE in H3, right?); and second, decide\n&gt;    - REJECT/ACCEPT.\n\nGenerally, yes. But I&#39;d usually only say &quot;rule in/out&quot; for the final \ndecision ruling a URI into the crawl or out of the crawl. Also, although \nmost of the existing rules are (a) applied on the basis of a test; and \n(b) &quot;one-way&quot;, if the test succeed, one decision is applied, but express \nno opinion if the test fails -- this test-and-one-decision approach is \nnot required of all rules. A single rule could give all of ACCEPT, \nREJECT, and NONE decisions.\n\n&gt; 2. Rules contained in a boolean rule would be queried solely for their\n&gt;    match function - whether they rule a URI in or out.\n&gt; 3. Boolean rule containers could supply the REJECT/ACCEPT decision for\n&gt;    all contained rules based on a poll of these rules&#39; match function:\n&gt; \n&gt;    - operation=OR: return configured boolean-container decision if any\n&gt;      contained rule matches (rules in); otherwise, return NONE (PASS).\n&gt; \n&gt;    - operation=AND: return configured boolean-container decision if\n&gt;      all contained rules match (rule in); otherwise, return NONE (PASS).\n&gt; \n&gt; I think my #2 idea above has two problems: a) matching and deciding\n&gt; are not separate functions on decide rules as currently implemented\n&gt; - this could likely be addressed through refactoring, though; and \n&gt; b) this proposal would cause configured decisions on rules \n&gt; in a boolean container to be ignored.  I don&#39;t know how to address\n&gt; the latter problem, which may be a fatal flaw.\n\nI think the risk here is that AND and OR have well-defined meanings in \nboolean logic, but since ACCEPT and REJECT are not the same as &#39;true&#39; \nand &#39;false&#39;, and there&#39;s the added layer of &#39;apply the configured \ndecision&#39;, the meanings brought in from boolean logic are just as likely \nto confuse as clarify. Hence, my preference for wordy descriptions like \n&quot;IfAllAccept&quot;/&quot;IfAllReject&quot; rather than &quot;AND&quot;.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve consciously gone in the direction of *more* rules, descriptively\n&gt;&gt; named, rather than fewer rules with internal settings (except with\n&gt;&gt; regard to the applied decision). So we have &#39;MatchesRegexDecideRule&#39; and\n&gt;&gt; &#39;NotMatchesRegexDecideRule&#39;, rather than a single &#39;RegexDecideRule&#39;\n&gt;&gt; which either has a &#39;not&#39; toggle or has to be wrapped in a &#39;not&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thinking of &#39;AND&#39;- and &#39;OR&#39;-like situations, this would suggest\n&gt;&gt; composite rules like &#39;IfAllAcceptDecideRule&#39;/&#39;IfAllRejectDecideRule&#39;,\n&gt;&gt; and &#39;IfAnyAcceptDecideRule&#39;/&#39;IfAnyRejectDecideRule&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again, this may seem a little strange but is based on experience where\n&gt;&gt; deep boolean combinations caused difficulty keeping track of whether, at\n&gt;&gt; a certain nesting, &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39; implied &#39;in&#39;, &#39;out&#39;, or &#39;no\n&gt;&gt; opinion&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the info, I&#39;ll think more about this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steve\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
