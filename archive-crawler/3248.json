There\nis a dirty fix to it by editing the Processors.options file and having\nseveral entries for the writer under different &#39;names&#39;. Basically each\nprocessor (just like the filters) needs a unique name. For the filters the\nuser provides the name. For the processors the name is provided in the\nProcessor.options file and must be unique within each processing chain. The\nfact that it need only be unique within each processing chain does actually\nlead to another possible dirty fix if you only need 2 instances. You could\nset it up like so:\n\nExtractor Chain\n&lt;Extractor Processors&gt;\n&lt;1st Writer Processor&gt;\n\nWriting Chain\n&lt;2nd Writer Processor&gt;\n\nYou could even do something like (although there may be &#39;gotcha&#39;s&#39; to this\nthat I&#39;m not seeing):\n\nFetch Chain\n&lt;Fetch Processors&gt;\n&lt;Extractor Processors&gt;\n&lt;1st Writer Processor&gt;\n\nExtractor Chain\n&lt;2nd Writer Processor&gt;\n\nWriting Chain\n&lt;3rd Writer Processor&gt;\n\nThe third possible fix (and perhaps the easiest if it works) would be to\nhand craft the order.xml. Just copy the WriterProcessor entry and make sure\nto change its name. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;ll work, it may be that the\nProcessor.options file is used to verify the processor names, but I don&#39;t\nthink so.\n\n- Kris \n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of pandae667\n&gt; Sent: 7. september 2006 07:29\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Filters vs. DecideRules Re: [archive-crawler] Re: \n&gt; Release 1.10.0 pending\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Michael,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One thing that came to my mind while testing - is there a \n&gt; way to add \n&gt; &gt;&gt; multiple ARCWriters to Heritrix, each with a seperate set of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; DecideRules/Filters so I can pre-categorize my data easily?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Should be no problem adding multiple writers, each with its own rule\n&gt; set.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think there is a problem about doing it - the webUI simply \n&gt; doesn&#39;t allow me to do it. It just allows me to add one \n&gt; writer of each type, adding multiple writers of the same type \n&gt; is not possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is why I happened to ask. I were unsure if this \n&gt; limitation is intentional - or just a shortcoming of the webUI.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;ll try if it breaks anything if I add them manually to \n&gt; the order.xml (and it would be nice for sure if a post 1.10 \n&gt; version of Heritrix would allow me to do it via the webUI, too)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
