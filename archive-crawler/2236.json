CVS HEAD often has problems, even occasionally\nfatal problems, but they are also regularly fixed. Your version from\nCVS of months ago could have serious problems... but only if they\npersist in current code would they warrant careful investigation.\n\n(2) At a time when all but 1 of the URLs have succeeded, call\nup a &#39;Frontier Report&#39;. What is the status of the queue holding\nthe problem URL? If it&#39;s in a multi-minute &#39;snooze&#39;, the topmost\nURL (which may be one of your URL&#39;s prerequisites) was tried and\nfailed and is awaiting retry. The default settings take many\nhours to finally give up on an URL, since transient network\nproblems are common, and once an URL is makred as &#39;failed&#39;,\nit is no longer retried.\n\n(3) Look in the &#39;local-errors.log&#39;. Many transient errors which\ndo not mark a URI as &#39;failed for good&#39; appear here. Many resolve\nwith a later retry, but seeing what sort of error is affecting\nthe URL(s) which remain unprocessed could help determine what&#39;s\nhappening.\n\nSimilarly, you could run a test crawl with very small\nFrontier &#39;max-retries&#39; and &#39;retry-delay-seconds&#39; settings --\nperhaps &#39;4&#39; and &#39;30&#39;. Then, unless the problem is some sort\nof long network hang, all URLs should either succeed or fail\nwithin a few minutes -- at least getting you error information\nin the &#39;crawl.log&#39; about everything.\n\n(4) Check to see if a substantially similar URL has been crawled.\nFor example, if you are having problems with &#39;http://example.com&#39;\nshowing as never-crawled, see if &#39;http://www.example.com&#39; has been\ncrawled. Our default canonicalization rules will consider these\nthe same URL in most situations, and until recently (and perhaps\nstill) certain combinations of URL seed/discovery ordering,\nredirections, and scope configuration can inadvertently keep the\n&#39;right&#39; variant from being crawled, once the &#39;wrong&#39; variant\nhas already marked the URL as done.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nJay wrote:\n&gt; I have been getting this message in the seeds report while the job is\n&gt; running.  Like I am crawling only 3 seeds and one of the seeds has\n&gt; this message and never got crawled even the job is finished (after 48\n&gt; hrs or so).  If I run the job again, sometimes it got crawled\n&gt; successfully all three.  And the URL, I am getting is not consistent.\n&gt;  I am getting this error on different urls from different job on\n&gt; different crawler.  At that same time, if I go to the URL in the\n&gt; browser, I have no problem. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am still using the version from CVS head like 3 months ago.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I am getting out of clues to debug this since the url who got error\n&gt; didn&#39;t show up in any log files even crawl.log.  Just only in the\n&gt; seeds report.  Can someone pointed me where to go to debug this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
