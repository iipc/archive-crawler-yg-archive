Now, when I create a job\nusing that profile it works fine. I just =\r\nran a crawl on a website, and\nall the URL&#39;s are resolving their DNS IP addr=\r\nesses.\n\nWhen I look at the default profile. I realize I don&#39;t know much abo=\r\nut\nconfiguring a crawl job on Heritrix. Could use some more documentation\no=\r\nn what all the modules do, and when to use them.\n\nWhat software do you guys=\r\n use to read the ARC files generated by a crawl?\n\nThanks for you help.\n\nI&#39;m=\r\n think this thing is complex to setup, and I&#39;ll be back to question\nsome mo=\r\nre questions.\n\n\n&gt; Have you customized the crawl configuration at all -- esp=\r\necially with \n&gt; regard to the PreconditionEnforcer, FetchDNS, or Scope comp=\r\nonents?\n&gt; \n&gt; What happens if you try using a bundled profile, with only the=\r\n minimal \n&gt; changes necessary to run -- a valid &#39;user-agent&#39; and &#39;from&#39; -- =\r\non a \n&gt; representative seed?\n&gt; \n&gt; On what OS are you running Heritrix?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n FYI, most of the core team uses Eclipse; Heritrix 1.x should build and \n&gt; =\r\nrun in Eclipse without requiring Maven at all.\n\n\n\n"}}
