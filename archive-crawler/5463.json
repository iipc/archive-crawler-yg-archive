(That&#39;s the current label of what&#39;s in \nSVN.) No official release will have such an odd middle number, though \nyou can grab the auto-builds off our build box, or build yourself from \nsource locally, if you&#39;re adventurous.\n\n1.14.1 is the most recent official release on the 1.X codeline.\n\nThere haven&#39;t been any substantive changes to the 1.X codeline since \nthat release, which was less than a month ago. All updates to robots \nhandling were in 1.14.1, as you can see from the changelog:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel\n\nI suggest sticking with the official release unless you&#39;re sure you&#39;ve \nseen something you need get committed to SVN.\n\nJavadocs on the website are rebuilt and uploaded on each auto-build, so \nreflect the SVN version number.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nMatt Kent wrote:\n&gt; It seems that Heritrix 1.14.1 is the most recent release. The Javadoc\n&gt; claims it represents version 1.15.2, but I can find no evidence of said\n&gt; version in SVN or Jira. Does a tag of Heritrix 1.15.2 exist anywhere?\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in the updates to the robots.txt stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
