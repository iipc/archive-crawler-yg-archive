In \n&gt; classic Slashdot style, they got a key detail wrong (Heritrix != \n&gt; Wayback).  But that leads to the question: is there any intent to \n&gt; release the Wayback Machine code as well, or are you guys cooking up a \n&gt; revised Wayback too?\n\nThanks! Slashdot attention often comes a little earlier than ideal,\nbut we&#39;ll take it. :)\n\nThw WM is older code of a different pedigree (Perl & C and Alexa\nauthorship) that probably won&#39;t be open-sourced anytime soon. We\nmight get around to a Java-based updating of that functionality\nat some point, which would probably be open source.\n\nIn the meantime, the NWA (Nordic Web Archive) has the first\nversion of their toolset available for download under the GPL:\n\n   http://nwa.nb.no/\n\nIt&#39;s better than the WM in several respects: full-text search and\na top-of-window &quot;timeline&quot; showing ticks where each page capture\noccurred.\n\nThere&#39;s no existing tool to coerce Heritrix ARCs into the NWA Toolset\nimport format -- but we&#39;d love to host such a tool in our project, if\nanyone writes it.\n\n- Gordon @ IArchive\n\n\n"}}
