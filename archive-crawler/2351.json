Everytime Heritrix trips over \na new host, we first get a dns record for the newly discovered. We treat \nthese dns URLs as we do any other adding them to the Frontier.  When \ncomes time to fetch dns, the FetchHTTP skips the URL because it only \ndoes &#39;http?&#39; whereas the FetchDNS fetcher, triggered by the &#39;dns&#39; scheme \non URL, &#39;fetches&#39; dns by asking dnsjava to fetch the &#39;dns&#39; URL.  dnsjava \n-- see dnsjava.org -- returns a dns A record from which Heritrix \nextracts IP of newly-discovered host which is used doing subsequent \nfetches of documents from the newly found host. We also write the dns to \nthe ARC file. Below is an example of whats written:\n\ndns:tcl.apache.org 192.168.1.254 20051103003416 text/dns 58\n20051103003416\ntcl.apache.org.         1800    IN      A       209.237.227.195\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
