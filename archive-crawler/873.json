Do you want the crawler to do it? Or\ndo you want to post-process the documents in an ARC file? Or is this\nunrelated to Heritrix at all?\n\nIf you are doing it inside of Heritrix then you can use the Java\ntranscoders. Again, you need to know that the documenting you are\nconverting is actually in Shift JIS though.\n\n&gt; I used nkf(network kanji filter).\n\nI&#39;ve never used it.\n\nWhat operating system are you on? On Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X you\ncan use the &#39;iconv&#39; command to do the conversion for you:\n\n% iconv -f shift_jis -t euc-jp infile &gt; outfile\n\nI don&#39;t know if there is a command-line transcoder publically\navailable on Windows. Certainly iconv can be built under cygwin.\n\n&gt; Bat becomes an error.(maybe gif/jpeg code)\n\nOr it could be an extension to Shift JIS, like Microsoft&#39;s CP932. Or\nit could be Chinese text. Or it could be Korean text... do you even\nknow that the document you are converting is in Shift JIS?\n\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
