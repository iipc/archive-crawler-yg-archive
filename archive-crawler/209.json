(Previously, subscription-requests were held for admin approval.)\n&gt;\n&gt;If there are any concerns about this transition -- for example, concern\n&gt;that project info that should not be made public is in the message or\n&gt;file archives -- please let me know.\n&gt;\n&gt;We are also considering moving project development discussion to a\n&gt;different listserver, perhaps at Sourceforge. Possible benefits\n&gt;would include:\n&gt;\n&gt;   (1) More familiar/open to walk-up open-source contributors\n&gt;   (2) Lower delays before messages are propagated to list\n&gt;       (We&#39;ve seen delays of several hours.)\n&gt;   (3) Less advertising\n&gt;\n&gt;However, the Sourceforge list service itself is currently going through\n&gt;growing pains, with the last couple of weeks of archives offline\n&gt;after a hardware migration, so any move on our part will wait until their\n&gt;services stabilize.\n&gt;\n&gt;Comments on this potential move welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Gordon @ IArchive\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
