One of our goals is to keep the cloud\n&gt; &gt; updated with the state of the project (e.g. by analyzing the nightly\n&gt; &gt; build). This is especially useful if you mark a warning as &quot;Not-A-Bug&quot;,\n&gt; &gt; so it can be suppressed, and this information is remembered.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perhaps the best short-term solution would be for you to point me to \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; build-artifacts produced after each nightly build. I can set up the\n&gt; &gt; cloud to download, analyze, and update the cloud after each build.\n&gt; &gt; Eventually can have the continuous build update the cloud directly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have more specific answers to some of your queries below:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; we&#39;ll need to learn\n&gt; &gt;&gt; how to tell FindBugs how to find &quot;missing classes needed for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; analysis&quot;, and how to exclude &quot;bugs&quot; which we want ignored.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I ran the analysis on H3. My approach was to download\n&gt; &gt; heritrix-3.0.0-dist.tar.gz, bundle all the jars, and separate out the\n&gt; &gt; ones that contain analysis classes and auxillary classes. From the\n&gt; &gt; command line, I use the following commands (assumes FindBugs is on the\n&gt; &gt; path):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; find heritrix-3.0.0 -name &quot;*.jar&quot; &gt; analysis.txt\n&gt; &gt; rejarForAnalysis -inputFileList analysis.txt -auxFileList analysis.txt\n&gt; &gt; -prefix org.archive\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This creates two jars &#39;analyze.jar&#39; and &#39;auxilary.jar&#39; that I use as my\n&gt; &gt; analysis target and auxilary class path respectively. There may be some\n&gt; &gt; classes missing -- FindBugs does a &quot;best-effort&quot; analysis and the\n&gt; &gt; missing classes don&#39;t necessarily lead to lots of missing warnings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To exclude entire bug patterns, I would use a FindBugs filter file\n&gt; &gt; described at: http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/filter.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; i really like the FindBugs Eclipse plugin, but don&#39;t see a way\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to get &quot;-emacs&quot;-like output from it, and it doesn&#39;t look like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; annotations (in the Bug User Annotations view) can be uploaded\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to the cloud from the plugin.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Eclipse plugin is currently being updated to support the new cloud\n&gt; &gt; features.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; when i open the Web Start client, it says &quot;not signed in&quot;, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Comunity Review page says a seperate browser window will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; open to login with OpenId. is there another way to login to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; review?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; We recently changed the workflow so you do not need to sign in unless\n&gt; &gt; you want to review a warning. When you try to do this, a message\n&gt; &gt; prompting you to sign in comes up. I&#39;ve updated the Community Review\n&gt; &gt; page &lt;http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/cloud/&gt; to reflect this.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which version of Heritrix was analyzed to produce the bugs in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the FindBugs Cloud? is there a way to see the options that were\n&gt; &gt;&gt; used to produce the cloud report for a particular project?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I analyzed heritrix-3.0.0. The warnings were filtered to only include\n&gt; &gt; warnings with bug ranks 1-14 and with associated source files. The \n&gt; exact\n&gt; &gt; commands were:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; findbugs -textui -xml *-output db.xml* -auxclasspath auxilary.jar\n&gt; &gt; analyze.jar\n&gt; &gt; setBugDatabaseInfo -resetProject -purgeStats -findSource [srcdir]\n&gt; &gt; *db.xml updated-db.xml*\n&gt; &gt; filterBugs -withSource -maxRank 14 -priority M -dontUpdateStats\n&gt; &gt; *updated-db.xml updated-db.xml*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it would be nice to reconcile the cloud bugs with the bugs i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find with a local client, so we can track them together.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; otherwise, i&#39;ll need to open a seperate issue simply to provide\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feedback to the cloud for Community Review. do you have another\n&gt; &gt;&gt; recommendation?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; We recently added features to FindBugs HEAD\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://code.google.com/p/findbugs/source/browse/#svn/trunk/findbugs&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that allow you to connect your local analysis to the cloud. This is\n&gt; &gt; still under development, but I can show you this if you are interested.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Nat\n\n"}}
