In simplest form, just\nan auxiliary textarea, similar to the seed entry box, would do.\n \nA next step might be to augment the seed entry box so that, if you&#39;re\nconverting seeds-as-surt-prefixes, to be able to flag certain supplied\nseed URLs to be used only as SURT filters rather than as seeds.  For\nexample, borrowing syntax I think I&#39;ve seen IA use, a seed list:\n    http://a.com/\n    +http://b.com/images/\nwould crawl starting from a.com, and include the b.com path as an\nadditional allowed scope. Functionally, no different than putting\nhttp://a.com/ in the seeds and putting a SURT-ified\nhttp://(com,b,)/images/ in the surts-source-file, but obviously simpler\nto configure.\n\nThat leads to the idea of an analogous &quot;-&quot; prefix, but then you start\ngetting into precedence and all the other stuff that the NewScopingModel\nis for...\n\n-Andy\naboy@...\n\n"}}
