(The &quot;Fix Version/s&quot; field\n&gt; suggests it will be fixed in 1.x, the tracker entry is allready marked\n&gt; as fixed - but nothing happened in 1.x regarding this issue so far.)\n&gt;\n&gt; A similar question is: are there any chances &quot;[HER-1311] Prioritzation\n&gt; refactoring: implement single privileged Frontier manager thread;\n&gt; mediation queues&quot; will be backported to 1.x? Or is it even possible?\n&gt; (I might give it a try myself if you say it could be done within a\n&gt; reasonable timeframe.)\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;   Olaf Freyer\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
