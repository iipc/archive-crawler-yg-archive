Then, it will ACCEPT URIs which are directly \nmatched, or whose &#39;via&#39; (1-hop-ago) URI matches.\n\nNote that if you have other rules (transclusion) for getting embedded \nresources, these still work and so in practice with such rules you may \ngo more than 1-hop-off.\n\n(To do N-hops-off would require some custom coding.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
