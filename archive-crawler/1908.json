Grab the file named\n&gt; &quot;metacombine_focusedCrawl_module1.0.tar.gz&quot;.  There is a\n&gt; README for brief install instructions, and a .pdf for more complete\n&gt; documentation.

The doc. is really great \ntoo: i.e. Overview.pdf (I like the suggestion of the classifier being \nused to censor whats downloaded, as well as for adaptive focused \ncrawling).  I&#39;ve added a link to our FAQ that points at the above \nannoucement (I&#39;ve also sent some feedback privately to Saurabh).\nGood stuff!\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
