I waited for a\n&gt; few minutes and it remains the same.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once I shutdown heritrix. It all comes back to normal. No more busy IO.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve had -Xmx1500m on 1.0.4 before. It never gives me this kind of IO\n&gt; rates. In fact the most I got from 1.0.4 was around 10-20% IO.\n\nJoe:\n\nI took a look at i/o in a rabid crawl.  I see some of the phenomeon you \ndescribe (My machine is in no danger of swapping so the i/o phenonmeon \nin my case was not as acute as for you).  Even after pausing the crawl, \nthere remains an i/o load.  Watching the bdb state directory, I see bdb \ncontinue to write logs -- lots of its 10Mb log files -- for quite a \nwhile after the pause.  Eventually, after quite a long time, all damps \ndown to near zero reads and writes.\n\nWe&#39;ll take a look. Maybe there&#39;s a tuning we can do in here to make the \ni/o loading less onerous (It does take a long time for the i/o to quite \ndown).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any one out there seeing heavy IO when running 1.4?\n&gt;\n1.0.4 kept alot of the important data structures in memory (Because of \nthis, the size of the crawl was bound by the amount of memory allocated \nto Heritrix). The  main change with 1.4.0 is that it now keeps these on \ndisk.  I&#39;d expect there to be a big difference in the i/o between versions.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; -joe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
