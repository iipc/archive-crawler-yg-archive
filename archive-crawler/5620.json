Thus unless you have thousands of target sites \nwith pending URIs, you are unlikely to see 100 threads all busy at once.\n\nI suspect you are crawling just a handful of large sites, in which case \ncrawling politely is the main factor controlling pace.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\npandya.bhavin@... wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am new to heritrix and trying to run one sample job but facing \n&gt; problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have configured &quot;max-toe-thread&quot; to 100 but still it never starts \n&gt; all threads.
