My top reportage on mem. usage and whats showing \n&gt;&gt;in the UI seem to correlate.  Are you sure its the heritrix app that \n&gt;&gt;showing using 28.8% of the heap?  The PIDs line up?  Which linux?  \n&gt;&gt;Kernel?  VM?\n&gt;&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;St.Ack\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am using bin/heritrix and still getting  65088 KB max heap size in\n&gt;the console. Started a crawl job and top shows 16.1 in %MEM column.\n&gt;All java pids line up. There are 50 of those java running I guess! 1\n&gt;for each toe thread? before starting the heritrix I did a ps -aef |\n&gt;grep java to see if there is any java running, there was none. I am\n&gt;running Gentoo linux, 2.6.7 kernel, sun-jdk-1.4.2.04. Any clue? \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, on linux pre-NPTL, each java thread shows as its own process \n(Config. out of the box has 50 threads start).  The way java heap works \nis that it will start at a minimum size and grow to an upper bound as it \nneeds the extra space.  Out of the box, heritrix specifies an upper \nbound of 256megs with no specification of initial heap size; it&#39;ll be \nJVM dependent (64megs on linux with SUN JVM is what I seem to remember, \nbut I could be wrong).\n\nYou didn&#39;t doctor the bin/heritrix script or override JAVA_OPTS?  If \nnot, you should be seeing max heap size 256megs in web UI for that is \nwhat the bin/heritrix script stipulates, not 64megs.\n\nI can&#39;t explain why your linux is showing such odd numbers for JVM \nusage.  It looks right in mine (Debian 2.4.22).  Maybe someone else can \nsay why.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;-Nachi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
