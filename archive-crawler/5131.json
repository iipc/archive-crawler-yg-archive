If that host \nis not responding, Heritrix (by default) goes into a slow-retry mode, \nretrying every 15 minutes. This will often look like no activity at all.\n\nSee if the Web UI frontier report shows a multi-minute snooze time on \nthat queue. Try the queue&#39;s top URI in a web browser. It may be \nnothing&#39;s wrong, there&#39;s just nothing gettable.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
