Maybe then this class would just read in all of the ARCRecord on \n&gt;&gt;construction?  Then you could do without the readAll.  Instead it&#39;d \n&gt;&gt;become a &#39;byte [] getBytes()&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I think reading the whole record on construction is a bad idea, it\n&gt;prevents you from just reading the metadata quickly.  A getBytes()\n&gt;method could transparently read the required data without it having to\n&gt;happen in the constructor.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Lars\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOk.  Just a suggestion.
