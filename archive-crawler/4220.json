I also used same number of retries, timeou=\r\nt. \n\nFor Heritrix I used the not-on-host decide rule to restrict to URLs\nfr=\r\nom news.bbc.co.uk and replace the ARC writer with Mirror writer.\nThen I ran=\r\n both together to make sure the site does not change a lot.\n\nNow, when I co=\r\nmpare the set of fetched pages, they are VERY different.  \nIn fact, Heritri=\r\nx seems to miss out many pages/URLs that I expected\nit to be able to fetch.=\r\n  So my question is, how do they different in \neach other in terms of the a=\r\nlgorithm used in crawling and fetching \npages. \n\nThanks,\n\nPhilip\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
