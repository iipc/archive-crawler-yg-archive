FindBugs &lt;http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/&gt; is a popular\n&gt; open source static analysis tool that can analyze Java software and\n&gt; identify bugs. We recently analyzed *Heritrix*, and identified about 42\n&gt; warnings that might be of interest to the project. You can launch an\n&gt; instance of FindBugs and evaluate each warning using this link (requires\n&gt; Java): http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/cloud/heritrix.jnlp (You may also\n&gt; comment on any warning by signing into a Google, Yahoo or OpenID account)\n&gt;\n&gt; FindBugs has recently started a community review of several open source\n&gt; projects. This is similar to a recently completed review\n&gt; &lt;http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/&gt; at Google in which almost 300\n&gt; engineers reviewed thousands of issues, fixing many of them. I would\n&gt; like to invite you all to participate in the review for Heritrix, and\n&gt; other open source projects. During the review, you are able to comment\n&gt; on each warning and evaluate it as &quot;Must Fix&quot;, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, &quot;Not a\n&gt; Bug&quot; and other classifications. We are particularly interested in\n&gt; learning if any warnings are causing problems in production.\n&gt;\n&gt; The list of projects currently included in our review is at\n&gt; http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/cloud/\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance for your consideration.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Nat Ayewah\n&gt; PhD candidate, University of Maryland\n&gt; http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ayewah\n&gt; ayewah@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
