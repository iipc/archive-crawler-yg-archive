The last 4 years, I have spent as an activist for peace and human rights (especially refugees and asylum seekers) on the Internet; I&#39;m also books author and ebooks publisher. I have launched many campaigns to improve our situation as refugees in Lebanon and hopefully bring more understanding to our problems worldwide. I helped make many changes and improvements at the UNHCR office in Beirut; I used the Internet as the field for my activities (you can read more about that in my free ebook &#39;MY CAMPAIGNS&#39;). All my ebooks are free and could be download from my sites.\n \nThis is my newest campaign, it&#39;s about the illegal and humiliating actions of the UNHCR, who using photos of refugees as banners and human-buttons to collect money. This is an abuse of the dignity and humanity of the refugees and must stop immediately and a clear public apology present by The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. My friends, I am talking about the pictures you can see here: http://www1.freehostingguru.com/un77\n Where you can read the rest of this message as web page.\n\nAlso you can read my new campaign &#39;Urgent, we need smile&#39; here: http://unhcrlebanon.fateback.comsmile.html\n\n \nFor more info about UNHCR and life of refugees you can read my free ebooks. I invite you as fellow humans and members of the world community to support my campaign by reading my article on my site and see the human-buttons. The campaign is to support and improve the UNHCR http://www.unhcr.ch especially after the last scandals in the UN and UNHCR, just for example: The refugees allege that UNHCR staff is selling most of the food items they are supposed to be supplied.\n&quot;They aren&#39;t supplying sufficient food to us because they sell most of the food items,&quot; they allege: http://allafrica.com/stories/200503140214.html\n\n Here is another example: Burmese Refugees Withdraw Protest Against UNHCR  http://www.mizzima.com/archives/news-in-2005/news-in-april/12-April05-22.htm\n\n&quot;We make demonstration and fast because the UNHCR office in Cairo did nothing for our problem...&quot; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4440730.stm\n\nTogether we will build better world.\n \nYou could reach me fast via this form: http://unhcrlebanon.wtcsites.com/email_me.htm\n and if you like to know more about me, you can google for my name &#39;osam altaee&#39;. \n \nThanks\nTHE TRUTH WARRIOR\nhttp://unhcr.fbhosting.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
