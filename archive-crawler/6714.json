Specifically URLs with .*text.*=\r\ntext.* and .*text.*javascript.* patterns occur a lot.\nOften, these URLs ret=\r\nurn a correct page (http 200 reponse), even when the harvested URL was neve=\r\nr intended to exist by the creator of the site (sometimes even a &quot;404&quot;-page=\r\n that is served with a 200-response). This is often the cause for crawler t=\r\nraps and harvests eating up available resources (for both server and harves=\r\nter).\n\nAs a crawl operator I can minimize these problem. However, it would =\r\nbe helpful if the harvested site never returned an ordinary response page a=\r\nnd response for these unintended URLs. At least the webserver should return=\r\n a 404 response.\n\nI was thinking that perhaps the harvested website should =\r\ngive an other response than 404 but how should a website differentiate betw=\r\neen ordinary (&quot;page not found&quot;) 404&#39;s and special (&quot;completely nonsensical =\r\nURL, stop this!&quot;) 404&#39;s? \n\nHeritrix does know the URL it tried was speculat=\r\nive, so I think Heritrix should deal with these 404&#39;s (or other error repon=\r\nses) differently. Maybe these pages shouldn&#39;t be stored and I guess they sh=\r\nouldn&#39;t be used for URL discovery.\n\nI am much interested to hear from other=\r\ns what you think of this problem. How should websites handle these unintend=\r\ned URLs? How should (or how does - I don know about the current implementat=\r\nion) Heritrix deal with other than 200-response pages after a speculative U=\r\nRL? \n\nThanks,\nRen=E9 Voorburg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"}}
