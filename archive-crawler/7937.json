Browsers these days have a way to view all the requests and responses as they go by (web console/net in firefox, developer tools/network in chrome, etc.) Open your url in wayback and look for 404s or other anomalies. When you see something is missing then you can try to figure out why. If you don&#39;t see anything missing at least you&#39;ve narrowed it down and can continue investigating elsewhere.\n\nNoah\n\n\nOn 2013-01-30 02:14 , Steph wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone!\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new to this group and new to web archiving.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m studying Media Preservation and for a project I try to save a few websites using Heritrix. It generally works really fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; But some websites really give me a headache, because the layout won&#39;t work. The images are all there, the Css files are also saved, but it won&#39;t show the defined frames! The content is just lined up, one below the other, instead of beneath or above each other.\n&gt;\n&gt; I already raised the number of MaxTransHops and SpeculativeHops and it worked for a number of websites, but not for this.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the websites is http://www.landesarchiv-bw.de.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe you can give me some advice?\n&gt; It would be very appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Steph\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
