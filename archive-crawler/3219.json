But that can just\n&gt; add to the number of things you need to keep trac=\r\nk of; even experienced \n&gt; crawl operators at IA often get these backwards.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; DecideRules add a little more complexity but are more explicit in thei=\r\nr\n&gt; intended effects:\n&gt;   - they answer ACCEPT, REJECT, or PASS\n&gt;   - by ch=\r\naining them, with some PASSes, they can achieve most of the\nsame\n&gt;     resu=\r\nlts that would require deep nesting of binary filters (with\n&gt;     logical c=\r\nombiners like AND/OR)\n&gt;   - in chains, the last non-PASS decision &#39;wins&#39;\n&gt; =\r\n  - by convention, pairs of DecideRule implementations are used, instead\n&gt; =\r\n    of a setting that inverts their conditional\n&gt; \n&gt; An illustrative exampl=\r\ne is the difference between URIRegExpFilter, and\n&gt; the pair of DecideRules =\r\nMatchesRegExpDecideRule and\n&gt; NotMatchesRegExpDecideRule.\n&gt; \n&gt; With URIRegE=\r\nxpFilter, you can answer only true or false. You need to\n&gt; consider what an=\r\nswer the context requires, and via the &#39;if-match-return&#39;\n&gt; setting, you can=\r\n control whether a regex match means &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; But it&#39;s quite=\r\n likely that the regex is not the final word -- if it\n&gt; matches, the URI is=\r\n &#39;out&#39;, but if it fails to match, the URI may not\n&gt; necessarily be &#39;in&#39; or =\r\n&#39;out&#39; -- other rules then kick in. So the \n&gt; non-match answer has to be log=\r\nically combined with other filter results.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the MatchesRegExpDecid=\r\neRule or NotMatchesRegExpDecideRule, you can\n&gt; arrange for any of the follo=\r\nwing four possibilities:\n&gt; \n&gt; ACCEPT if matches, PASS otherwise\n&gt; REJECT if=\r\n matches, PASS otherwise\n&gt; ACCEPT if not matches, PASS otherwise\n&gt; REJECT i=\r\nf not matches, PASS otherwise\n&gt; \n&gt; The named return values constrain the us=\r\nage context to interpret the\n&gt; answer in a certain way -- no &quot;does true mea=\r\nn &#39;include&#39; or &#39;exclude&#39;\n&gt; here?&quot; confusion -- and the PASS lets one rule o=\r\nf a group contribute\n&gt; nothing to the final decision, if its condition isn&#39;=\r\nt met. (No need to \n&gt; wrap it in a AND/OR to express operator intent.)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n (By prepending such a rule with an all-ACCEPT or all-REJECT rule, you\n&gt; ca=\r\nn set a &#39;default&#39; answer for PASS.)\n&gt; \n&gt; So that DecideRules can be used an=\r\nywhere Filters were, there is a \n&gt; DecidingFilter class, which lets (chains=\r\n of) DecideRules be used to \n&gt; render a Filter true/false response. But we =\r\ngenerally prefer to use \n&gt; DecideRules in new contexts, and if there&#39;s a ne=\r\nw CrawlURI-test to be \n&gt; implemented, would like it implemented as a Decide=\r\nRule rather than a \n&gt; Filter. Then it can be used in Filter contexts (via D=\r\necidingFilter) and \n&gt; DecideRule contexts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does that make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n- Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; pandae667 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Michael,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I just added 3=\r\n tiny contributions to the &quot;Feature Request&quot; tracker I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; like to see in=\r\n the forthcoming release.
