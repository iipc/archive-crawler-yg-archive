(I don&#39;t think any of the \nproject committers regularly use Windows, and there are no dedicated \ntesting resources for verifying Windows operation.)\n\nWhile usually things hold up on Windows, sometimes things break and we \nonly hear of it -- and receive fixes -- via the community. (When they do \nbreak, it&#39;s most often around \nfilesystem/interprocess/environment-variable issues. Also, I doubt the \nHeritrix 3.X checkpointing will work efficiently or perhaps at all on \nWindows without some extra attention; it may be relying on hard-linking \nbehaviors that are different on NTFSes.)\n\nSo if you have a choice of target system, we recommend a Linux, such as \na recent Ubuntu.\n\nWith regard to the specific problem, I believe the arcreader.cmd and \nheritrix.cmd are doing about the same things to set up the environment \nand Java class-discovery classpath... so if heritrix.cmd is working for \nyou, examining the arcreader.cmd to ensure it is behaving the same might \nhelp. If you discover a fixable problem in the current version of \narcreader.cmd, please let us know.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 9/13/12 11:07 PM, badal301 wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have crawled one simple website, and it created WARC file.
