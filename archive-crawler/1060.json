I could only add a couple of\ngeneral ideas. You mention that you judge a new software version by\ntwo things:\n\n* crawler behaviour \n* reports and log files produced by the crawl\n\nBut it could be worthwhile to look at the stuff that has been\ndownloaded. How well the crawler has downloaded difficult file types,\nlike streaming media or files that were generated from complex script\nurls =&gt; Are the downloaded files complete and usable. I remember some\nnational libraries (Australia?) have written papers about how\ndifferent harvester software manage to download unusual file types.\nYour url list &#39;many_seeds.txt&#39; contains quite strange looking sites \nthat should produce lots of problematic file types. \n\n(But maybe it&#39;s quite difficult at the moment to grab any individual\nfiles out of heritrix archive files for testing purposes)\n\nDo you have estimates on the number of files that your test servers\ncontain = can you say for sure that you can get about 100% from any\narbitrary server&#39;s contents, or 95%, or 80% or some other coverage. \n\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The Archive Web Group had a meeting here this morning and hashed out\nthe \n&gt; following rough release plan.  We thought the list would be\ninterested \n&gt; to hear what was decided.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ll probably make a 1.0.6 with a fix for &quot;[ 1028913 ]\nEnd-of-crawl \n&gt; reports no happen (Stuck StatLogger): \n&gt;\nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=det\nail&aid=1028913&group_id=73833&atid=539099&quot;\n\n&gt; this week or early next week (We&#39;re still trying to figure why no \n&gt; reports at the end-of-crawl).\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;re planning to code-freeze a 1.2 release around October 1st. \nWe&#39;ll \n&gt; then run it through our test cycle which comprises generally of a\nweek \n&gt; of test crawls followed by a week of production crawls (A rough\nTest \n&gt; Plan can be found here: \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CrawlTestPlan).  1.2\nwill \n&gt; have the priority 8 and above features from the RFE list which can\nbe \n&gt; found here: \n&gt; https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102.
