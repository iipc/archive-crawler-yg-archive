Is that right?  Or is it that your classifier \njust looks at links?  If its looking at links only, then you&#39;d override \nthe PostSelector, the processor that schedules links with the Frontier, \nso that you could do a JNI call out to Bow to ask it if a link should be \nscheduled, or you could add a new Processor into the Post-Processing \nChain (http://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual.html#N1012B) \nthat happened before the PostSelector and in here knock out URLs you \ndon&#39;t want crawled.   If you need to feed Bow the page content, you&#39;d \nwrite a new Processor that passed Bow via JNI the file on disk that had \nthe downloaded document (We might need to do a little work in Heritrix \nbecause we usually keep the request in memory only spooling to disk if \nthe request is &#39;large&#39;).    Bow would do its thing and return a score \nback across the JNI bridge.  Your BowProcessor would check the score \nagainst a configurable boundary.  This new BowProcessor could be \ninserted into the Heritrix extractor processing step before all other \nextractors.  If the returned value was above the boundary score, then \nyou&#39;d let the page through to the extractors for links to be found; \notherwise, you&#39;d skip the extractors so no URLs would be pulled from \nthis page.  Or you&#39;d package your processor as a filter for the \nARCWriter step and if the score was below the configured threshold, \nyou&#39;d not write the page into the ARCs.\n\nMaybe you&#39;d combinations of the above?\n\nLet us know how we can help.  Integrating such a classifier would be a \nnice feather in Heritrix&#39;s cap.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\nSaurabh Pathak wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The focusing dials on Heritrix are in synopsis:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Scope (Domain, Host, Path, etc.)\n&gt; &gt; - Filters (Regex on URL, Regex on Content-Type, etc.).\n&gt; &gt; - Size of response, time to complete response.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sounds like you want a &#39;classification dial&#39; of some sort.  Can you\n&gt; &gt; describe what this classifier would do?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your reply Stack. I dont think scope or filter dials are\n&gt; sufficient to meet my purpose.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a brief description of what I want to do,\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to build a crawl collection for a topic and hence I need to\n&gt; run a focused crawl instead of a normal crawl. I have trained the Bow\n&gt; classifier to recognize pages relevant to the topic. Now I want to\n&gt; hook up this trained classifier to  Heritrix in such a manner that\n&gt; Heritrix consults this classifer before following any link. In short I\n&gt; want to add a URL to frontier only if it belongs to the topic (if the\n&gt; score returned by the classifier meets a minimum threshold value) \n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way to accomplish above task?\n&gt; please let me know if anything is still unclear or not properly\n&gt; explained by me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best,\n&gt;\n&gt; Saurabh\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
