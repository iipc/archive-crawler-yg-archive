We\nare currently using He=\r\nritrix 1.12.1.\n\nWe have a home-grown Spring MVC interface to monitor Heritr=\r\nix using\nSpring&#39;s MBeanProxyFactoryBean to control remotely a bunch of\ncraw=\r\nlers.  This is great for pausing, resuming and viewing reports but\nwe would=\r\n like to also have a way to use our interface to add Regex\nstyle rules via =\r\nJMX for times when a crawler hits a trap in mid-crawl.\n Currently we have t=\r\no go to the Heritrix WEB UI to make these changes.\n Specifically it would b=\r\ne useful to be able to remotely add\nRegexDecideRules to the &quot;scope&quot; setting=\r\n of the crawl and\nuri-canonicalization-rules within domain overrides.\n\nThan=\r\nks!\n\nAdam\n\n\n"}}
