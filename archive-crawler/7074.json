So you&#39;d probably want to add that in the \ncode, so that only the &#39;metadata&#39; records with the info you want are \nwritten.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 3/21/11 7:12 PM, cstadler18 wrote:\n&gt; Is there a way to process the HTML that is written to the ARC file BEFORE its written to minimize size of ARC files.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example :\n&gt; 1.
