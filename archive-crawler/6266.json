With beta, I could see \n&gt; millions of URIs discovered and crawl with exactly the same settings.\n&gt; I am not a heritrix developer. People who worked on the beta and the \n&gt; final release: any clue what (modules) underwent changes that possibly \n&gt; could affect the uri discovery?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Pranay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
