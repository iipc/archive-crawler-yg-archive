It \nwould be good if the page wasn&#39;t posted to the remote process at each \nmention of the DR down-along the processing chain.\n\nYou might give yourself more options if you write the \nquerying-of-another-process as a distinct processor rather than as a \nDecideRule.  This processor could run after the fetcher step and mark \nthe CrawlURI with the result of analysis: a flag to accept or reject or \nprobably better, a score or a series of scores for the case where the \nremote side is running more than just a single analysis.  You could then \nwrite a DecideRule that looked for the presence of these scores, \nrejecting or accepting the page based off its findings in CrawlURI.   \nInstances of these DRs could be inserted at various points on the \nprocessing-chain.\n\nWould be sweet if you could use the old-faithful, HTTP, for your RPC&#39;ing \nbut perhaps it is too heavyweight. \n\nDo you think the posting writer necessary?  (I suppose it is if \npreviously-fetched pages will influence the scoring of subsequently \nfetched pages.)\n\nYou could host it all and just keep the list up-to-date with new \nreleases as is done with the zvents HDFS Writer Processor, or if \nsufficently generic, we could add the page-posting processor to Heritrix \nand you could host the page-analysis code again keeping the list \nup-to-date on releases.
