However you call them, they have t=\r\nhe \nadvantage that you do not have to evaluate all the rules in the chain. =\r\nThis \nshould considerably speed up crawling.\n\nImagine the following setup:\n=\r\n\nDecideRuleSequence:\n1.

With a RejectIfAnyDecideRuleSequence \n(y=\r\nour suggested name is ok), it would look like the following:\n\nDecideRuleSeq=\r\nuence:\n1. AcceptDecideRule\n2. RejectIfAnyDecideRuleSequence:\n  a.
