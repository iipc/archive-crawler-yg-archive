Thus\n&gt; you could not only make the crawl uri pass information from one\n&gt; processor to the next, but a parent URI could pass information to\n&gt; child URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; For adaptive focused crawling, it is very helpful to be able to pass\n&gt; miscellaneous information from parent pages to children.\n\nYes.  Makes sense.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In Heritrix, I can see where attributes could be copied into child\n&gt; URIs -- in the handleLinkCollection method of the Postselector class, \n&gt; for example, when the CandidateURI is formed.  So I would like to\n&gt; extend Postselector and over-ride just this one method, but it is\n&gt; private.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do you all decide which methods to make protected and which\n&gt; private?  Maybe it would be nice to allow the application programmer\n&gt; to add attributes to the CandidateURI before it goes onto the\n&gt; frontier, perhaps by some call-back or by factoring out a protected\n&gt; and over-ridable method that decorates the CandidateURI.\n\nI made the Postselector#schedule method protected so you can override\nit in HEAD.  Is this sufficent?\n\n(We try to follow general rules keeping the API as narrow as possible,\nmaking as few methods as possible public, with all others protected\nand all data members private, but we aren&#39;t always consistent).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Or perhaps there is some better way to add historical information to\n&gt; candidate URIs before the parent CrawlURI is lost forever and before\n&gt; the child CandidateURIs are added to the frontier?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any thoughts/info before I go copying humongous swatches of\n&gt; code out of the Postselector into my own custom Postselector.\n&gt; \n&gt; D.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
