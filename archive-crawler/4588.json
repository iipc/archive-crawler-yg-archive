If I use http://www.my=\r\njones.com/code/signup.php as the seed and set\nthe crawler to only the seed.=\r\n This URL will get an HTTP response\nstatus 302 and be redirected to\nhttp://=\r\nwww.myjones.com/code/signup.php?cook=3Dt, because there is no\ncookie setted=\r\n.\n\n2. Same thing happens for http://www.myjones.com/code/. It will get\n302 =\r\nand be redirected to http://www.myjones.com/code/?cook=3Dt\n\n3. If I use bot=\r\nh http://www.myjones.com/code/ and\nhttp://www.myjones.com/code/signup.php a=\r\ns the seeds and set the\ncrawler to save and load cookie from file,\nhttp://w=\r\nww.myjones.com/code/ still get 302 and be redirected to\nhttp://www.myjones.=\r\ncom/code/?cook=3Dt, but\nhttp://www.myjones.com/code/signup.php will be craw=\r\nled successfully\n(200 OK). \n\nCan anybody tell me how to retry http://www.my=\r\njones.com/code/ ?\n\nSaid in another way. Now the situation is\n\nURL #1 and #2=\r\n are in the seeds list.\n\nURL #1 (with no cookie) got 302 and be redirected =\r\nto URL #3 (set cookie)\n\nURL #2 (load cookie) got 200 OK\n\nCan I retry URL #1=\r\n with the cookie, so it can be correctly crawled?\n\nthanks\n\n\n"}}
