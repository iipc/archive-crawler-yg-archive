When I criate a simple\n&gt; &gt; job, consisting with =\r\none or more seeds from the same domain (eg:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.zzz.com.br/ and =\r\nhttp://www.zzz.com.br/aaa), and create an\n&gt; &gt; exclude filter with the URIRe=\r\ngExpFilter, the URI&#39;s that are covered by\n&gt; &gt; the regular expression has no=\r\nt been crawled... It&#39;s perfect! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, when I create a job (or a pr=\r\nofile), with an override for the\n&gt; &gt; domain of the seed (http://www.zzz.com=\r\n.br, in my example), and use the\n&gt; &gt; same filter of the single job, it has =\r\nnot been applied. The URI&#39;s that\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t want, are beeing captured. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anybody has an idea of what is happening?\n&gt; \n&gt; One idea of something=\r\n to check: is the override set up as intended?\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe stray space/d=\r\not characters can lead to confusion, as can\n&gt; the way overrides are hierarc=\r\nhically organized in reverse-order of\n&gt; hostname parts. That is, inside the=\r\n (possibly empty) &#39;br&#39; override,\n&gt; is a (possibly empty) &#39;com.br&#39; override,=\r\n which has inside it a\n&gt; (possibly empty) &#39;zzz.com.br&#39; override, which has =\r\ninside it the\n&gt; &#39;www.zzz.com.br&#39; override.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gor=\r\ndon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\nHi Gordon, \n\nIn fact what you said it&#39;s happening. Only the lo=\r\nwer level of the\nhierarchy (that corresponds to http://www.zzz.com.br) cont=\r\nains any\nconfiguration. Others levels are empty. \n\nBut I want to apply thes=\r\ne filters on the URI&#39;s from a specific domain.\nFor example:\n* http://www.zz=\r\nz.com.br/page.php?id=3D### (this URI is desired)\n* http://www.zzz.com.br/se=\r\nction/page.php (this URI is desired too)\n* http://www.zzz.com.br/print.php?=\r\nid=3D### (this URI is not desired,\nbecause the content was visited before, =\r\nthe id&#39;s are the same and the\nuri has just the content on a good format for=\r\n printing)\n* http://www.zzz.com.br/sectionNotDesired/page.php (this URI is =\r\nnot\ndesired, because it&#39;s section does not matter)\n\nTo apply 2 URIRegExpFil=\r\nters on these URI&#39;s I created a override from\nthe address http://www.zzz.co=\r\nm.br/. I think that it&#39;s sufficient to\ncover the main content and the secti=\r\nons of the seed. So the filters\nare on the lower level of the hierarchy (co=\r\nrrespondent to\nhttp://www.zzz.com.br). \n\nAm I doing anything wrong? Or mayb=\r\ne is it a bug from Heritrix. \n\nOnce more, thanks very much for the support.=\r\n\n\nAndr=E9 Lanna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
