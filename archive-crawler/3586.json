Do you \n&gt; think its a good idea to add a Canonicalization Rule for the same.\n&gt;\n\nThanks for the paper. I just briefly scanned the section on trailing \nslash normalization and the results of 50% duplication are expected \nwithout any normalization.\nAs I said, most of URLs without trailing slashes are redirects. These \nredirects also have tendency to be same documents. Often empty documents \nwith same footprint, so I am not surprise that half of the requests are \nthe same.\nNow, I was surprise that the lost was not larger when removing the \ntrailing slash. However, that depends of the order of the harvest. If \nyou first crawl pages with trailing slashes and then ignore ones without \nthere is likely to be no lost. Anyhow, I will have to read the paper \nmore carefully; sometime normalization and canonicalization can have \ndifferent meanings and it possible that I misunderstood the figures.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Anmol\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/8/06, *Igor Ranitovic* &lt;igor@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:igor@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Hi Anmol,\n&gt;\n&gt;     In my experience, these two URLs are usually distinct documents where\n&gt;     the first one is redirect to the second one. So, in most cases you\n&gt;     want\n&gt;     to get them both. However, if you are not interested in replaying\n&gt;     harvested documents you can choose not save redirects by using\n&gt;     filters\n&gt;     on ARCWriter (or some other writer). Or you can easily add a new\n&gt;     regular\n&gt;     expression cannon rule to avoid getting both. In this case be sure\n&gt;     that\n&gt;     URLs that you shown below are really duplicates.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I hope this helps.\n&gt;     i.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I am pretty certain there is something I am not doing right, just\n&gt;     that I\n&gt;     &gt; am trying to pin point the issue.\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; I am seeing pages\n&gt;     &gt; http://xyz.com/target\n&gt;     &gt; and\n&gt;     &gt; http://xyz.com/target/\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; both fetched separately.
