The state is the following: Heritrix is not\nrunning with SP2.\n\nWhen i start crawling a job: it discoveres 2 documents\nand queus 4. That&#39;s it! All  the other logs are empty\n(during the crawl).\n\nBut in the Frontier report there was one entry that\nthere was one document in the queue that was snoozing.\nI was waiting till the &quot;Wakes in:&quot;-timer went down to\n0. The result was that the whole crawljob was marked\nas finished and in the crawl.log i got the following\noutput:\n\n20050224174047675    -6          - dns:www.cp.jku.at P\nhttp://www.cp.jku.at/ no-type #001 30024 - 2t\n20050224175547709    -6          -\nhttp://www.cp.jku.at/ - - no-type #001 - - 2t\n\ni read in the manual that the -6 status code is\nreturned, when the dns-lookup fails. So i thought that\nthis might be connected with the dnsjava-dependency.\nLooking into the readme of dnsjava i found the\nfollowing statement:\n\nIf the underlying OS is Windows, winipcfg/ipconfig can\nbe called and the output parsed.  Note that this may\nfail for non-English versions of Windows. \n\nI&#39;m using the english version of windows on my comp\nand on the other computer i tried to run heritrix at\nhome. The prof has the german version of windows xp,\nso i guess that&#39;s what causing all the troubles with\nheritrix.\n\nSo now my question is how can this problem be solved??\n\nRegards,\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nYahoo!
