It was previously needed for o=\r\nne of our \n&gt; default Processors (I think it was FetchHTTP), but is not \n&gt; c=\r\nurrently used by any standard Processors, and thus may not \n&gt; have been rec=\r\nently tested/maintained to work properly.\n\nOk I don&#39;t need this functionali=\r\nty, they are sufficiently thread-safe.\n \n&gt; If you are configuring your craw=\r\nl with many ToeThreads, but \n&gt; only seeing one active, it&#39;s most likely tha=\r\nt&#39;s because the \n&gt; standard politeness behavior -- never opening more than =\r\none \n&gt; connection to a single hostname and never hitting a single \n&gt; hostna=\r\nme too rapidly -- make it so that with your crawl, no \n&gt; more than a single=\r\n (or small\n&gt; number) of threads is ever needed.\n\nHow do we override this po=\r\nliteness functionality and is that possible?  The\nonly option I saw about p=\r\noliteness is IP-Politeness under the Frontier, and\neither setting of False/=\r\nTrue provides the same results.\n\n&gt; How many hosts are you trying to crawl? =\r\nWhat does a &#39;threads \n&gt; report&#39; and &#39;frontier report&#39; show during the crawl=\r\n -- are \n&gt; there an excess of &#39;READY&#39; queues in the frontier while \n&gt; threa=\r\nds sit idle?\n\nI am also only working on one hostname.  \n\n------------------=\r\n--------\nToe Threads Report\n--------------------------\n\nToe threads report =\r\n- 200508152149\n Job being crawled: focusedcrawler\n Number of toe threads in=\r\n pool: 10 (1 active)\n   ToeThread #1\n     #1    [no CrawlURI]\n        WAITI=\r\nNG for 36s657ms\n        Where: ABOUT_TO_GET_URI for 36657ms\n   ToeThread #2=\r\n\n     #2    [no CrawlURI]\n        WAITING for 3s250ms\n        Where: ABOUT_=\r\nTO_GET_URI for 3250ms\n   ToeThread #3\n     #3    [no CrawlURI]\n        WAIT=\r\nING for 17s172ms\n        Where: ABOUT_TO_GET_URI for 17172ms\n   ToeThread #=\r\n4\n     #4    [no CrawlURI]\n        WAITING for 8s969ms\n        Where: ABOUT=\r\n_TO_GET_URI for 8969ms\n   ToeThread #5\n     #5    [no CrawlURI]\n        WAI=\r\nTING for 51s891ms\n        Where: ABOUT_TO_GET_URI for 51860ms\n   ToeThread =\r\n#6\n     #6    [no CrawlURI]\n        WAITING for 51s891ms\n        Where: ABO=\r\nUT_TO_GET_URI for 51860ms\n   ToeThread #7\n     #7    [no CrawlURI]\n        =\r\nWAITING for 51s891ms\n        Where: ABOUT_TO_GET_URI for 51860ms\n   ToeThre=\r\nad #8\n     #8    [no CrawlURI]\n        WAITING for 51s891ms\n        Where: =\r\nABOUT_TO_GET_URI for 51860ms\n   ToeThread #9\n     #9    [no CrawlURI]\n     =\r\n   WAITING for 33s235ms\n        Where: ABOUT_TO_GET_URI for 33235ms\n   ToeT=\r\nhread #10\n     #10\nhttp://www.xsb.com/SP_Weave.html%5B/HTML%5B1%5D/BODY%5B1=\r\n%5D/DIV%5B1%5D/DIV%5\nB3%5D/DIV%5B3%5D/TABLE%5B1%5D/TBODY%5B1%5D/TR%5B1%5D/T=\r\nD%5B1%5D/DIV%5B1%5D/A%\n5B1%5D/text()%5B1%5D%5D (0 attempts)\n        L http:=\r\n//www.xsb.com/SP_Weave.html\n        Current processor: PartitionerExtractor=\r\n\n        ACTIVE for 3s735ms\n        Where: ABOUT_TO_BEGIN_PROCESSOR for 672=\r\nms\n\n--------------------------\nFrontier Report\n--------------------------\n\n=\r\nrontier report - 200508152153\n Job being crawled: focusedcrawler\n\n -----=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D STATS =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----\n Discovered:    612\n Queued:       =\r\n 555\n Finished:      57\n  Successfully: 57\n  Failed:       0\n  Disregarded:=\r\n  0\n\n -----=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D QUEUES =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----\n Already included si=\r\nze:     612\n\n All class queues map size: 1\n             Active queues: 1\n  =\r\n                  In-process: 1\n                         Ready: 0\n         =\r\n              Snoozed: 0\n           Inactive queues: 0\n            Retired =\r\nqueues: 0\n\n -----=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D IN-PROCESS QUEUES =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----\nQue=\r\nue www.xsb.com\n  555 items\n    last enqueued:\nhttp://www.xsb.com/techPlatfo=\r\nrms.html%5B/HTML%5B1%5D/BODY%5B1%5D/DIV%5B1%5D/\nDIV%5B3%5D/DIV%5B4%5D/A%5B1=\r\n%5D/text()%5B1%5D%5D\n      last peeked:\nhttp://www.xsb.com/technology.html%=\r\n5B/HTML%5B1%5D/BODY%5B1%5D/DIV%5B1%5D/DIV\n%5B3%5D/DIV%5B3%5D/TABLE%5B1%5D/T=\r\nBODY%5B1%5D/TR%5B1%5D/TD%5B2%5D/DIV%5B1%5D/\nP%5B1%5D/A%5B6%5D/text()%5B1%5D=\r\n%5D\n   total expended: 0 (total budget: -1)\n   active balance: 3000\n   last=\r\n(avg) cost: 0(0.0)\n\n -----=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D READY QUEUES =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----=\r\n\n\n -----=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D SNOOZED QUEUES =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----\n\n -----=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D INACTIVE QUEUES =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----\n\n -----=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D RETIR=\r\nED QUEUES =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----\n\n\n\n"}}
