We also have a lot of related code, etc.\n&gt; built to create and work with these.  The existing schema for the\n&gt; order.xml works well enough for our needs to be able to validate the\n&gt; order.xml file. With the sheets way of configuration is there a way to\n&gt; serialize the configuration to a file?\n\nWell, sheets are just plain text files. The global.sheet file is  \nbasically the same as order.xml.\n\nWere you including override settings in your preservation repository?  \nOverrides are stored in a BDB in 2.0, so that might cause some  \ndifficulties for you.\n\n&gt; And can we generate the\n&gt; configuration without using the web interface?\n\nYes. The web interface uses JMX to control Heritrix; you can use  \ntools like jconsole to control Heritrix, or write your own Java  \nprograms to control it. Ideally there&#39;d be an easy way to send JMX  \nmessages to Heritrix without needing Java; see my latest message to  \nErik Hetzner for ideas there.\n\nAgain, the sheets are plain text files, so you can also write them by  \nhand or use a script to generate them.\n\n&gt; My other concern with heritrix 2.0 is that hcc is incompatible with\n&gt; it. How incompatible? Is this just in the short-term or is  hcc being\n&gt; phased out?\n\nSee my most recent message to Daniel Clark. In summary: Yes, we  \ndefinitely plan to support hcc or integrate hcc-like features  \ndirectly in the engine; no, we don&#39;t have a timeframe for that yet.\n\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Andrea\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n\n-Paul\n\n"}}
