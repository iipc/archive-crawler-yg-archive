The reason I ask is that I need to know when a seed is done\nso that I can index that url with lucene.  I have successfully writen\na DiskWriterProcessor that does a good job mirroring a site and\nwriting it disk.  Now I need to Index each site separately.  I would\nlike to use the current threads that Heritrix has instead of indexing\nafter a full crawl has been comleted.  If I knew when a seed is\nfinished then, i can spawn my indexer.  Im not sure if I was able to\narticulate this correctly, but I hope you get the jist of it.  \nThanks,\n\n~chris\n\n\n"}}
