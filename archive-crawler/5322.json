It automatically builds a CLASSPATH containing \nevery JAR it finds in the &#39;lib&#39; directory -- you may want to try \ndropping your other JAR there.\n\nBut, it&#39;s impossible to tell for sure what&#39;s happening in your situation \nwithout seeing the errors.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nlpeterus wrote:\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;lpeterus&quot; &lt;lpeterus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lpeterus wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I made a processor for inserting content information into a mysql\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; database. I included the name in processor.options and placed the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .java file into the writer folder in the source. Then built heritrix\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using Maven. The new processor does show up on the webUI but the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; processor doesn&#39;t work correctly when I do a crawl. I get toethread\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; errors, am I doing this wrong? Thanks.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Without knowing the error, it&#39;s impossible to tell. If it&#39;s not \n&gt;&gt;&gt; something like &#39;class not found&#39;, and the crawl launched before the \n&gt;&gt;&gt; error occurred, it&#39;s probably a bug in your code.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I actually modified the code seen in this article. I&#39;m not sure if its\n&gt;&gt; not up to date with heritrix 1.14 or something I changed. For the most\n&gt;&gt; part I just altered it to accept xml rather than html and got rid of\n&gt;&gt; the strip tag function and where it was used. \n&gt;&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/4538\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, I believe its not recognizing the driver. I&#39;m using the mysql\n&gt; supported JDBC driver thats wrapped in a jar file. Its manual says to\n&gt; add the path to jar file into CLASSPATH like this:\n&gt; export set CLASSPATH=/path/mysql-connector-java-[ver]-bin.jar:$CLASSPATH\n&gt; Since I don&#39;t have admin rights on the system, I&#39;m using the Java\n&gt; thats extracted/installed in my home directory. When I run a script to\n&gt; use the driver after exporting, it sees the driver and works. When I\n&gt; use it in heritrix, it doesn&#39;t work because the errors get caught by\n&gt; exceptions. \n&gt; Is it possible that adding it to CLASSPATH doesn&#39;t allow the Java\n&gt; program (which I set JAVA_HOME to when running Heritrix) to see where\n&gt; the driver is?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
