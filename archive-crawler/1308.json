I was very surprised to see\nthat my module&#39;s constructor was called twice!  (This was seen via\ndebugging prints to heritrix_out.log.)  Suspicious, I then reran the\norder file with the -n switch on heritrix.  Without the console, the\nconstructor was called only once, as expected.\n\nWithout looking at the .jsp&#39;s in any detail, it appears that each\ninvocation of my module comes after a slightly different series of\nwebapp events.  In Java-land, both invocations started from\nThreadPool.java line 511 (in PoolThread.run).  The non-console run\nstarts with Heritrix.main which calls doStart which calls\ndoOneCrawl and is then off and running.\n\nHas anyone else observed this problem with the console?  Was it just\noperator error on my part?  \n\nIt can be dangerous to have your constructor called twice, since you\nmight want to do some one-time I/O, for example.  Since the problem\ncan be worked around, it is not too serious, but I was curious.\n\nRegards, D.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
