How can we run 2 simultaneous crawls? We wanted to run 2 or multiple\n&gt; crawls at the same time because we are time constraint and have a lot\n&gt; of web sites to crawl. We also wanted that each website has its own arc\n&gt; file. I tried running a second heritrix at a different port but it\n&gt; would not start up. How can I do it?\n\nI&#39;m guessing you&#39;re asking about running two instances on the same \nhardware and that you got an exception complaining about address already \nin use?\n\nHeritrix on a 1.5 JVM sets up listeners on two ports.  There is one \nlistening port for the web UI and then another listening port for the \nJMX Agent.\n\nYou can stipulate the web UI port from the command line but specifying \nthe JMX port on the command line is a little awkward because we&#39;re using \nthe JVM&#39;s JMX Agent.  The JVM&#39;s JMX Agent takes its configuration as \njava system properties passed on the command-line.  By the time the \nHeritrix command-line processing goes into effect, the JVM&#39;s JMX Agent \nconfiguration has been acted on (Later we&#39;ll put up our own JMX Agent. \nThen it&#39;ll be possible to dictate as a command-line option to Heritrix \nthe port to listen on).\n\nMeantime, you need to use the JMX_PORT environment variable.  Here is \nhow you would run two Heritrix instances on same hardware, one on \ndefault ports of 8080 for UI and 8849 for JMX Agent and the other with a \nUI on port 8081 and its JMX Agent on 8850:\n\n% ${HERITRIX_HOME}/bin/heritrix\n% JMX_PORT=8850 ${HERITRIX_HOME}/bin/heritrix --port=8081\n\nIf you&#39;re problem is other than the above, please paste in the exception \nyou got on crawl fail (Check content of ${HERITRIX_HOME}/heritrix_out.log).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. I also noticed that in the console, only one thread is active most\n&gt; of the time. Is this normal? I am worried because I have allerts like\n&gt; https://guides-online.visitsingapore.com/tgls/loginProcess1.jsp RIS\n&gt; still open. Should have been closed by method release: ToeThread #35:\n&gt; https://guides-online.visitsingapore.com/tgls/loginProcess1.jsp(in \n&gt; &lt;https://guides-online.visitsingapore.com/tgls/loginProcess1.jsp%28in&gt;\n&gt; processor HTTP).\n&gt;\nIf you are using a single crawl to crawl a single site, yes, because the \ncrawler is trying to be &#39;polite&#39;.  See &#39;6.3.3.1. Politeness&#39; in the User \nManual, http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html.  See also \n&#39;7.1.2. Job Status Box&#39; under the &#39;Load&#39; section for discussion of why \nonly a few threads are running and &#39;Politeness&#39; in the glossary.\n\nRegards the &#39;RIS still open&#39;, which version of Heritrix are you using?\n\nThanks,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
