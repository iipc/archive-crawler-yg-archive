So one\npossible approach would be wiping=\r\n the queue when the budget is exceeded.\n\nBut I do see another option that m=\r\night be better:\nWhy enqueue this stuff when we allready do know things will=\r\n never be\nprocessed?\n\nSo my question(s) are: \n - is this 2nd approach reaso=\r\nnable at all?\n - does writing a postProcessor for such a task seem the righ=\r\nt thing\nto do? (which can decided things are out-of-scope if their queues\nb=\r\nudget would be exceeded after their addition)\n\nAny thoughts/comments are we=\r\nlcome.\n\nRegards\n  Olaf Freyer\n\n\n"}}
