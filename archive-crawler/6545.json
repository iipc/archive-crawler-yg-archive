What shows up \nin the logs?\n\n(Oddly enough, some kinds of OOMEs can be made more likely by increasing \nthe heap size, because they&#39;re actually caused by a depletion of some \nresource pool other than the object heap. So it&#39;s important to \nunderstand what kind of OOME is happening; later JVMs give better info.)\n\nThat line of memory consumption indicates over 3GB free; in such a \nsituation there&#39;s no need to be concerned about reported usage unless \nover many successful crawl cycles the &#39;low-water&#39; mark of usage keeps \nincreasing. (If so, it could be useful to analyze what&#39;s sticking around \nwith other heap-analysis tools -- but at this point what you&#39;ve \ndescribed doesn&#39;t yet definitively indicate that anything is.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 5/20/10 11:47 PM, katare_glg wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;      I am running Heritrix 3.1.1 Snapshot release and have allocated around 5 GB memory to it. The reason for allocating this much memory is to avoid out of memory errors since at times I put around 5 heavy sites for spidering. The spidering goes through well but even after the jobs are done, Heritrix consumes a substantial amount of memory with many threads alive.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is what the memory consumption looks like:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1210132 KiB used; 1277056 KiB current heap; 4551168 KiB max heap\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any way I can free up the memory used by Heritrix since the idle time memory consumption is increasing?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Prashant.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
