IMHO,\n&gt;leaving the compression to the underlying layers would lessen the risk\n&gt;of the file itself becoming unreadable.  Hardware compression stays with\n&gt;the hardware, in-format compression can (and does) confuse people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nWe haven&#39;t done any study comparing the two.\n\nInteresting is that there is nothing said about compression in the arc \nformat specification. \n\nSlinging arcs usually means compressed arcs, at least hereabouts at the \narchive, so makes sense for us to both write and read compressed \nversions. I just added a note to the developer manual that talks of the \nparticular way in which gzip; A gzip member per arc record rather than \none gzip member to hold the total arc.\n\nIts possible to disable heritrix&#39;s writing of compressed arcs via \nconfiguration, if its local policy to collect in uncompressed mode.\n\nOn &quot;in-format compression ... confuse people&quot;, I&#39;m with the Tom Emerson \ncomment that its not zlib thats at fault.\n\nThanks Lars,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;-Lars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
