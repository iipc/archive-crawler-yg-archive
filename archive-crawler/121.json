We found two \nmain points to support this:\n\n1.  URLs that are outside of the host that link to the host \nIgor wrote a script that queries google using the &quot;link:www...&quot; \nfeature and finds all the pages that are not reachable through the \nhost.  In other words, it finds those pages that are not linked to \nwithin the host, but are only linked from outside of the host.  For \nhost &quot;www.exploratorium.edu&quot;, we found that this number amounted to \nabout 10% of the pages that google had but heritrix did not.\n\n2.  Outdated google links-database\nFor example, when we \nentered &quot;link:www.exploratorium.edu/pr/candy.html&quot; in the google \nsearch field, we got &quot;www.exploratorium.edu/pr/&quot; as one of the \nresults.  But when we actually searched for &quot;candy.html&quot; on \nthe &quot;www.exploratorium.edu/pr/&quot; page it was no where to be found.  \nEven the cached version of the /pr/ page did not contain the link.  \nThis occurred with other pages we searched for as well, not \nonly &quot;candy.html&quot;.  Finally, by doing a search on the complete cdx \nfiles, we found that &quot;www.exploratorium.edu/pr/&quot; actually did link \nto &quot;candy.html&quot;, but that was back in April.  The google link search \nwas returning outdated results that were relevant to a few months \nago, while the resulting page had already changed.  It seems that \ncandy.html, as well as many other pages from the 1,000 pgs/host \ngoogle search, are unreachable through the host.\n\nTherefore, heritrix is probably doing better than the reports \nindicate, as many of the URLs that heritrix did not find are not \nlinked from the host.\n\n\nJudy\n\n\n"}}
