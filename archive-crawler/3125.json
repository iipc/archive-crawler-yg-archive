I am however\nfavo=\r\nring plain RMI over JMX on RMI connectors, I might even have to\ncut down so=\r\nme more chores to cut down on a node load. \n\nA node heartbeat mechanism is =\r\nmaintained to keep the Hash functions\nsynced across the nodes and to mainta=\r\nin the global noe information,\nhowever, this is a new problem : In dynamic =\r\nsetup when the number of\nagents leave/join, how does one ensure DeDuplicati=\r\non. The Already Seen\nlist from the frontiers is not shared, as a result a n=\r\new node might\nrefetch a URL already fetched by another node. (It is sometim=\r\nes not\neasy to visualize how? I can feed in more details). Any ideas on tha=\r\nt\nfront. \n\nI guess we might have to scale to 4-5 boxes to fetch the billion=\r\n+\nmark, and hence this is an issue of concern.\n\n\nregards,\nAnmol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- I=\r\nn archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sha=\r\nrad Agarwal wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; stack@... &lt;mailto:stack%40archive.org&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Sharad Agarwal wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;+ =\r\nDid you use the ubicrawler ConsistentHashFunction\nimplementation that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nis in Heritrix in the dsi.unimi.it jar or did you use something else?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; yes. the same one.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Be warned=\r\n we recently removed the colt jar from Heritrix.
