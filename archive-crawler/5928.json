Just one of them use ReplayCharSequence by:\nReplayCharSequen=\r\nce cs =3D null;\ntry{\ncs =3D curi.getRecorder().getReplayCharSequence();\n...=\r\n\n}finally{\n if (cs !=3D null) {\n  try {\n   cs.close();\n  } catch (IOExcepti=\r\non ioe) {\n   //log\n  }\n }\n}\n\nSo I guess I properly close it.\nAnd according =\r\nto the lsof, all the &quot;open&quot; files seem to be of .ris extension. I can&#39;t eve=\r\nn find which one of the processors I&#39;m using uses ReplayInputStream:\n\nFetch=\r\nDNS\nFetchHTTP\nMySQLWriter (uses ReplayCharSequence and closes it at the end=\r\n)\nCrawlStateUpdater\nMySQLScheduler (acts almost exactly like FrontierSchedu=\r\nler but schedules some extra links)\n\nI have been using the YourKit Java pro=\r\nfiles, and here I have taken a HPROF snapshot after running the crawler for=\r\n about 80 minutes: http://rapidshare.com/files/256114129/Heritrix-2009-07-1=\r\n5.hprof\nat the moment, the number of open files by lsof is 2867 and keeps g=\r\nrowing..\n\nBesides, there is a little inconvenience in FetchHTTP. As Spring =\r\nrequires for a property to be set, both, the setter and getter, to be of th=\r\ne same type, it was not possible to set timeoutSeconds in the spring-conf f=\r\nile, as it is initialized as follows:\n\n    {\n        setTimeoutSeconds(20*6=\r\n0); // 20 minutes\n    }\n    public int getTimeoutSeconds() {\n        return=\r\n (Integer) kp.get(&quot;timeoutSeconds&quot;);\n    }\n    public void setTimeoutSecond=\r\ns(Integer timeout) {\n        kp.put(&quot;timeoutSeconds&quot;,timeout);\n    }\n\nint i=\r\nn the getter and Integer in the setter.\nI had to edit FetchHTTP manually (p=\r\nublic void setTimeoutSeconds(int timeout)) and recompile the whole project =\r\nfrom sources.\n\nWell, hope to hear any good news about &quot;RIS&quot; and again, appr=\r\neciate the support!\n\nKing regards,\nIkrom\n\n\n"}}
