And I have exprienced a strange behaviour:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When setting send-range to true, Heritrix doesn&#39;t honor the entries\n&gt; &gt; in robots.txt anymore ! When setting send-range back to false, it\n&gt; &gt; works right.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think it could be related to the response code &quot;206&quot; instead of\n&gt; &gt; &quot;200&quot; of the webserver when using the &quot;range&quot; header.\n&gt;\n&gt;I think you are correct.  Here is where we save off the downloaded\n&gt;robots.txt file into the corresponding CrawlServer:\n&gt;http://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/datamodel/CrawlServer.html#133. \n&gt;\n&gt;If the return code is not 200 explicitly, we treat it as equivalent of\n&gt;no robots at all and so act as though we have free rein to download all\n&gt;of the site.\n&gt;\n&gt;Looks like we should act as though we got a 200 for at least 203 and\n&gt;perhaps a 206.  Meantime, I&#39;ve made an issue.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks for debugging what was going on as well as the order and seed to\n&gt;illustrate the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
