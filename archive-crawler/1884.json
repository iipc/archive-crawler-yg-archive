(Heritrix) There is no way to turn off cookie support (would be a\n&gt; quick-fix).\n&gt; 2. (Heritrix/HttpClient) Cookies are kept in memory (instead of bdb etc.)\n&gt; 3. (HttpClient) HttpState access to cookies is sluggish (by \n&gt; implementation and\n&gt; API).\n&gt;\n&gt; I would still regard them not as bugs but RFEs, because breadth-first \n&gt; crawls\n&gt; still are experimental. However, I would assign a high priority.\n\nOn 1., in the above, I just committed an option to disable cookies.  On \n2., in the above, yes, we&#39;ve noticed this doing memory profiling.  On \n3., very interesting.  Stands to reason I suppose given its an ArrayList.\n\nWe should try and figure a patch that we can contribute back to the good \nfolks at apache httpclient.\n\nI&#39;ve made an RFE for 2. and 3: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1208757&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\n&gt;\n&gt; And finally, adding the stacktrace dump to ToeThread.report() would \n&gt; also be a\n&gt; nice enhancement IMHO. To keep Java 1.4 compatibility, I suggest to \n&gt; keep that\n&gt; feature in a special class which is only loaded if Java &gt; 5.0 is \n&gt; present. (I\n&gt; will file an RFE with a patch soon).\n\n\nI committed the above contribution of Christian&#39;s.  I&#39;d recommend list \nmembers go check out this sweet addition (Get latest build and look at \nToeThreads report running Heritrix using a 1.5.0 JVM. Notice the added \nstack traces).\n\nGreat stuff Christian,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Christian\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Christian Kohlschï¿½tter\n&gt; mailto: ck -at- NewsClub.de\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
