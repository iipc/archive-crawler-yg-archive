Can you first give me \n|feedback on the below?\n|\n|+ &quot;Error: Invalid Crawler Supplied&quot; whenever I tried &#39;creating test set&#39; \n|(Selected &#39;heritrix&#39;, then filled out next screen variously -- if I left \n|it empty or filled in a bunch of text it still gave me the error \n|message).  This stops me being able to use the tool (Yesterday it seemed \n|to work -- it at least generated a seed url for me).\n|+ Title is also misspelled on home page.\n|+ I added a crawler.  Its named heritrix too but had a different \n|version.  In drop down it only shows the crawler name, not version, so \n|its hard for me to distingush between the two.\n|+ I see on disk and in your commit of last night that tests on the \n|filesystem are named &#39;test1&#39;, &#39;test3&#39; etc.  Do they have to be named \n|so?  Could they have more meaningful names so the &#39;background image \n|extraction&#39; test (test1) was  contained in a directory named \n|&#39;bkgrd_image_extraction&#39; or some such.\n|+ Whats &#39;webroot&#39; in the &#39;Add Test&#39; page?\n|\n|Thanks Parker,\n|St.Ack\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Parker Thompson &lt;parkert@a...&gt;\n|wrote:\n|&gt; Soren,\n|&gt; \n|&gt; This means that the requisite PHP PEAR DB libraries are not\n|installed.  I\n|&gt; believe this can be fixed by using a newer version of PHP, though\n|you can\n|&gt; as easily fix the problem by grabbing the libraries from crawl08. \n|If you\n|&gt; do that (as I did on crawl08) you&#39;ll need:\n|&gt; \n|&gt; /0/apache/webgarden_docroot/DB/\n|&gt; /0/apache/webgarden_docroot/HTML/\n|&gt; /0/apache/webgarden_docroot/HTML_Common-1.2.1/\n|&gt; /0/apache/webgarden_docroot/HTML_Table-1.5/\n|&gt; \n|&gt; And one other caviat.  To load the database you&#39;ll have to comment\n|out the \n|&gt; line &#39;&#92;connect - parkert&#39; in crawlertesting.sql.  I missed this\n|since it \n|&gt; doesn&#39;t error out on my machine (or grab the working version from \n|&gt; crawl08).
