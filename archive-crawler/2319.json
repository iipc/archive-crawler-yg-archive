I \nremember that there was a thread about a similar problem a few months ago, \nbut I am not able to locate it in the archives -- could somebody kindly \npoint me to the relevant thread, or give me fresh advice if previous advice \nis not relevant?\n\nYour web page says to let you know if your web crawler doesn&#39;t behave\nwell. I thought you would be interested to know that your web crawler\ngenerated 88 error404 messages in one day on one single page (\nhttp://water.usgs.gov/ogw/bgas/forms/course_evaluation.html). To the best\nof my knowledge, the page is fully functional, and the problem is in your\nhow your web bot handled the form.\n\nSecond, this morning I also noticed an out-of-memory error, and the crawler \nwas in pause mode. I sort of expected this, given the warnings re broad \nscope in the documentation, but I am wondering: is there any use in \nresuming the job (I crawled about half as much the data I would like to \ncrawl), or will it get out of memory again soon anyway? Any other solution? \n(e.g., some setting I can change on the fly?)\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarco\n\n\n-- \nMarco Baroni\nSSLMIT, University of Bologna\nhttp://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni\n\n\n\n"}}
