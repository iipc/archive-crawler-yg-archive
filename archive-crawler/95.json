It&#39;ll do Word, as \nwell as several other MS formats, and looks mature.\n\n  http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/\n\nThis is available under the apache liscense.\n\nPDF Documents:\n\nThere are also a number of pdf readers for java and this choice seems to \nbe slightly less obvious.  The most promising choices are as follows.\n\niText - This is a very mature pdf reader/writer and is available under the \nLGPL.  Of note, this is used by the Alexa toolbar.\n\n  http://www.lowagie.com/iText/\n\nPDFBox - This is a fairly young and basic pdf processor, but it proports \nto extract text, and the bare-bones nature may be an asset if we start \nthinking about performance.  This is made available under the BSD license.\n\n  http://pdfbox.org/\n\nThere were several others, but they seemed to be less desirable for a\nnumber of reasons.  Specifically, most had overly restrictive licenses, or\nwere pre-1.0 releases.\n\nFlash:\n\nThere was only one Java package I found that was available for free that \nmay do what we&#39;re looking for here.  It is called javaswf, and can be \nfound here:\n\n  http://www.anotherbigidea.com/javaswf/\n\nIt looks like nothing has happened with the project in about a year, so\nit&#39;s safe to assume we&#39;d be taking this as-is.  Since it&#39;s in alpha that\nmay not be workable, but then again it may beat starting from scratch if\nwe decide this is a must-have.  It&#39;s available under a modified BSD\nlicense that should meet our needs in the even we do want to use it.\n\n\nThat is an initial survey.  If anyone has comments on software I should \ntake a(nother) look at that would be great.  Also, it might be useful to \nexpand this discussion to other popular formats.  Any other formats we \nwant to consider at the moment?  It occurs to me that I did not look at \nrtf, but I imagine there should be some Java classes for that.\n\npt.\n-- \nParker Thompson\nThe Internet Archive\n510.541.0125\n\n\n"}}
