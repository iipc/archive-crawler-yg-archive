For example:\n\nCase 1: Suppose you want to crawl only pages from a particular host, and \nyou want to avoid crawling too many pages of the dynamically generated \ncalendar.  Here&#39;s how you would use the DecidingScope to setup this crawl...\n\nCase 2: Suppose you wanted to only grab 5 pages from each of the 10 the \nseeds...\n\nCase 3: Suppose you only want to crawl URLs that match \nhttp://foo.org/bar/* and you only want to crawl URLs that end with .html...\n\nEach of the use cases could point out how the fetchers, extractors, \ndecide rules, canonicalizer, etc. would effect the crawl.  This would \nhave been really helpful to me when I was a newbie.  :)\n\nFrank\n\n"}}
