I download and install Heritrix into my Linux\n&gt; box. Start the crawler like what the user manual said. Then login to\n&gt; the WUI and created a crawl job using default setting. I put in\n&gt; http://www.testserver.com/ in the seed list.\n&gt; The job start and finised fine. But with very little result return.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my arch/xxxxxx.arc file, after the information section, only 3\n&gt; lines for every seed i used. for example,\n&gt; \n&gt; dns:www.testserver.com 111.111.111.111 200501010101 text/dns 58\n&gt; 200501010202\n&gt; www.testserver.com. 86400 IN A 111.111.111.111\n\nDNS lookups for your seeds are succeeding.\n\n&gt; And the content of my seeds-report.txt is always like\n&gt; [seeds]                   [res-code]  [status]\n&gt; http://www.testserver.com -61         NOTCRAWLED\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is this -61 code returned and why NotCrawled?\n\nYou can look up crawl.log status codes in the manual here:\n\n  http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#statuscodes\n\n&quot;-61&quot; is &quot;Prerequisite robots.txt-fetch failed, precluding a fetch attempt&quot;\n\nThe server(s) may be completely unreachable -- so Heritrix isn&#39;t\neven getting a 404 for /robots.txt. From the same machine on which\nHeritrix is running, can you access the sites with a web browser?\n(Do you need to use a web proxy to do so?)\n\nAlternative, something about the crawl configuration may be preventing\n/robots.txt from being fetched. If you have changed the scope, added\nfilters, or reduced the allowable &#39;max-trans-hops&#39; for your crawl,\nthis might be the case.\n\nDoes the crawl show as &#39;finished&#39; very quickly? If so, your crawl\nconfiguration is probably to blame -- the /robots.txt URLs were never\ntried.\n\nIf the crawl shows as running for a while, but makes no progress, it&#39;s\nretrying the /robots.txt multiple times with pauses between, but failing --\nin which case it&#39;s probably your network. (After it is done with retries,\nthe /robots.txt URLs will show in the crawl.log with whatever error\ncaused their last failure.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
