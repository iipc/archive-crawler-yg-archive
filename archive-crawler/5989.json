If=\r\n heritrix is already heavily loaded, then what would be its behaviour for n=\r\new jobs. Would it run or not, etc .\n\n2) If i have given TOTAL-BANDWIDTH-USA=\r\nGE parameter as &quot;0&quot;, it means no limit (adjusted by heritrix). But, i would=\r\n like to know about heritrix general performance.   What would be bandwidth=\r\n limit for each job, max bandwidth limit provided by heritrix.\n\nApart from =\r\nthese, is there any boundary limit for any settings or configuration option=\r\n in heritrix ?\n\nThanking you.\n\nRegards,\nTarun\n\n\n\n"}}
