Sometimes I would like to put a comment in a rule sequence\n&gt; and this would be a way to do that.\n&gt; \n&gt; * Debug Output.  Instead of editing conf/heritrix.properties to enable\n&gt; verbose logging and then restarting the heritrix daemon, why not have\n&gt; a no-op rule that appends to a file with details about how a\n&gt; particular rule sequence processed a URI (or DNS lookup).  \n&gt; \n&gt; ** by default, it should stop emitting output after the first 100\n&gt; items.  This means it could safely stay in place without causing any\n&gt; problems in production. \n&gt; \n&gt; ** all the pertinent state (URI/DNS operand, fetch state, attributes,\n&gt;  final decision, and the submodule name) that helps in tweaking a rule\n&gt; sequence should be emitted with a timestamp.\n&gt; \n&gt; This would work great for v1.x; I have not used v2.x much yet, so I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure how this kind of thing fits into the &quot;sheet&quot; concept.\n&gt; \n&gt; (I would *not* try to implement this with the normal logging facility\n&gt; because that would complicate usage.  Consider that people unfamiliar\n&gt; with logging properties should be able to use it.  Also, logging is\n&gt; priority-oriented, so separating some output to a special file by kind\n&gt; instead of by priority is not straight forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
