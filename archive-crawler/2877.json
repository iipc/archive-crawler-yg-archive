I can\n&gt; surmise how this behavior might come about - but was this changed in\n&gt; 1.8?  We are currently using 1.5 here.\nWork to ensure we don&#39;t hold memory across jobs was added to 1.6.  You \ncan check to see if your 1.5 has the improvements by looking for the CVS \ncommit message cited in the &#39;2005-11-08 18:34&#39; entry of this issue --  \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1123230&group_id=73833&atid=539099 \n-- in the CVS log for Heritrix.java or CrawlJob.java.  If your 1.5 has \nthe improvements and is still holding memory across jobs, then we should \nmake a new issue.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
