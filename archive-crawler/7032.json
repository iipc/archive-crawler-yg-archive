However, when I run\n&gt; Heritrix 3.0 with my WriterProcessor then it correctly downloads the\n&gt; contents of the seeds I supply and also the robots.txt files. However\n&gt; it does not download the contents for the URLs generated after the\n&gt; seed. The log file gives the following message for all URLs generated\n&gt; after the seeds:\n&gt;\n&gt; 2011-02-21 11:07:44.708 SEVERE thread-14 org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchDNS.storeDNSRecord() Failed store of DNS Record for dns:search.yahoo.com\n&gt; java.io.IOException: RIS already open for ToeThread #15: dns:search.yahoo.com\n&gt;          at org.archive.io.RecordingInputStream.open(RecordingInputStream.java:84)\n&gt;          at org.archive.util.Recorder.inputWrap(Recorder.java:144)\n&gt;          at org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchDNS.recordDNS(FetchDNS.java:271)\n&gt;          at org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchDNS.storeDNSRecord(FetchDNS.java:216)\n&gt;          at org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchDNS.innerProcess(FetchDNS.java:171)\n&gt;          at org.archive.modules.Processor.innerProcessResult(Processor.java:177)\n&gt;          at org.archive.modules.Processor.process(Processor.java:144)\n&gt;          at org.archive.modules.ProcessorChain.process(ProcessorChain.java:131)\n&gt;          at org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.run(ToeThread.java:146)\n&gt;\n&gt; It says that RIS is already open. However in my code I have not made\n&gt; use of the ReplayInputStream at all and am just making use of the\n&gt; CrawlURI and then using the openstream() function to download the\n&gt; contents. I am not quite clear about the tasks that are done in\n&gt; innerprocess() function of the ARCWriterProcessor. So am not able to\n&gt; find the bug in my code.\n\nThere&#39;s no &#39;openstream()&#39; method on CrawlURI; can you be more specific \nabout what you&#39;re doing?\n\n(If you&#39;re getting the data from a fetch for analysis/writing, then you \nare in some way or another opening an InputStream or ReplayCharSequence \nfrom the Recorder data, and it needs to be cleanly closed in any \neventuality.)\n\nIf you remove your writer, and just do a short test crawl without \nwriting anything, do the above errors go away?\n\nAre the errors always on DNS URIs, as in your example above, or all URI \ntypes? Is it exactly your seeds + the robots.txt URIs that succeed, then \nno other URIs? (So, exactly 2 times the number of seeds are shown as \nfetch successes?)\n\nAre you using the Heritrix 3.0 original release as your base, or more \nrecent code from the project SVN/dev-builds?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
