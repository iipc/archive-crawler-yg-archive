Keeping \nthem for at least a little while, up to your available storage, means \nyou&#39;ll have some opportunity to investigate any oddities you notice \nduring crawling by seeing what was actually retrieved\n\n- simply by removing the &#39;writer&#39; processor from the default \nconfiguration, retrieved content won&#39;t be saved -- but you&#39;ll still have \nthe URLs visited and retrieved lengths in the crawl.log\n\n- in addition to removing the &#39;writer&#39; processor, you could early-abort \nmany fetches as soon as you get the headers. Custom &#39;mid-fetch&#39; decide \nrules on the FetchHTTP processor can do this for you. However, you \ndefinitely still want to get content that has outlinks (so you can \ndiscover them), and you&#39;d have to take an extra step to record the \nimplied length (such as the Content-Length header) of material you \nearly-abort. So this last option will take extra customization, but will \nsave some on bandwidth. (For example, you can early-abort all images.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nnukleonrus wrote:\n&gt; I am using Heritrix to determine the size of austrian internet.\n&gt; The problem is that I dont have so big storage to crawl all websites.\n&gt; I need only to know the sizes of files inside domain names.\n&gt; Is in Heritrix a feature that downloads a file, writes up a filesize and removes file immediatly, so the storage is no problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks in advance\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
