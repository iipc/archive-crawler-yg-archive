There is one within the gui, but we do not plan\n&gt; on using the gui. Is there a switch i,e &#39;heritrix --shutdown&#39; that\n&gt; will shut it down from within the shell? And if not, why wasnt there\n&gt; one put in place. I hate to criticize such an excellent product, but\n&gt; doing kill,killall IMO doesnt make sense when you can have a shutdown\n&gt; method via command line parameter. \n&gt; \n&gt; -Ahnu\n\nHas to be done.
