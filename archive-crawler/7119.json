You can find and edit this file directly on the filesystem \nbefore you start your crawl. (When it&#39;s over a certain manageable size, \nthe web UI will no longer show the in-page editable textarea.)\n\nH3 is better at handling millions of seeds, but we&#39;ve done hundreds of \nthousands of seeds in H1 without problems.\n\nRegarding your other questions:\n\n(2)\n\nFor postprocessing analysis that pulls together a bunch of related \nresources (such as a text/html page and all scripts it inlines), you&#39;ll \nwant to create a master index of what&#39;s spread across your files, then \nuse that index to guide you to individual resources. Our &#39;Wayback&#39; \nproject for browser access does this, as part of its operation, so you \nmay want to look at it for ideas and code that&#39;s applicable to your use.\n\n(3)\n\nThere&#39;s no master reference; our general recommendation is to start with \nthe bundled defaults and tinker incrementally.\n\nMany of the major alternative settings and components are discussed in \nthe H1 user-manual \n(&lt;http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/index.html&gt;) or H3 \nwiki user-manual \n(&lt;https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Heritrix+3.0+User+Guide&gt;). \nBut others are discussed in other wiki pages, or old discussion threads, \nand to find and understand all the lesser-used options requires \nreviewing the Javadoc comments and raw source.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 4/20/11 12:14 PM, Muath Alkhalaf wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So is this file a global configuration file for Heritrix and if so where\n&gt; can I find it and what will happen to the configuration from the web\n&gt; interface?

I have a\n&gt;&gt; seeds file with 100K URLs but I do not know how to provide it as input.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; In first you have to comment 2 beans and uncomment only one bean. The 2\n&gt; beans you have to comment them are as follows:\n&gt;\n&gt; The first one\n&gt; ------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;!--&lt;bean id=&quot;longerOverrides&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.beans.factory.config.\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;property name=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;props&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;prop key=&quot;seeds.textSource.value&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; # URLS HERE\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;/prop&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/props&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/bean&gt;  --&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The second one\n&gt; ----------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;!--&lt;bean id=&quot;seeds&quot; class=&quot;org.archive.modules.seeds.TextSeedModule&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;property name=&quot;textSource&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;bean class=&quot;org.archive.spring.ConfigString&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;               &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;                 &lt;value&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; # [see override above]\n&gt;\n&gt;                 &lt;/value&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;               &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;             &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;property name=&#39;sourceTagSeeds&#39; value=&#39;false&#39;/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/bean&gt;--&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; After that you have to uncomment the following bean:\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;bean id=&quot;seeds&quot; class=&quot;org.archive.modules.seeds.TextSeedModule&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;property name=&quot;textSource&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;bean class=&quot;org.archive.spring.ConfigFile&quot;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;property name=&quot;path&quot; value=&quot;seeds.txt&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;property name=&#39;sourceTagSeeds&#39; value=&#39;false&#39;/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Note that: I put seeds.txt in the same directory of Heritrix. You can\n&gt; put it under any directory as you want, but you have to write its path\n&gt; in the value as shown above.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2- Here is the scenarion I want to use Heritrix for and I would like\n&gt;&gt; to know if my assumptions are correct. I want to gather a data set\n&gt;&gt; consisting of webpages that have:\n&gt;&gt; a- HTML forms\n&gt;&gt; b- Javascript processing forms data.\n&gt;&gt; Then I will go offline and iterate over the ARC archive files that\n&gt;&gt; result from my crawl using a java program. While iterating, I can\n&gt;&gt; check each one of the files if it is of type html/text and if so check\n&gt;&gt; if it contains an html form. If it does and the code that processes\n&gt;&gt; the form is in a separate javascript file is there a way to extract\n&gt;&gt; that file from the archives using for example its URL as an index or\n&gt;&gt; do I have to download that file again?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; I can&#39;t give you the correct answer.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 3- Is there a good reference with some example profiles with values\n&gt;&gt; for the different configurations available along with description of\n&gt;&gt; when to use each of these profiles (I mean based on the bandwidth\n&gt;&gt; available to my machine and its processing power I can use these\n&gt;&gt; reference examples to better decide different inputs).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; You can look at this URL\n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/6771. I hope\n&gt; it helps you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for your help\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
