The i=\r\ndea is to harvester \nthis page only a couple of times or once during that y=\r\near.\nWhat if the user asks for page with date 1.1.2005 We have to return a =\r\n\nfront page with date 30.6.2004, or earlier, and explain that \nit&#39;s virtual=\r\nly the same page but was harvested only once?\n \n\nkaisa\n\n\n\n--- In archive-cr=\r\nawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristinn Sigurdsson&quot; \n&lt;kris@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve just finished putting together a (very initial) proposal for \nan =\r\nadd-on\n&gt; to Heritrix that would give it the ability to recrawl websites and=\r\n \nadjust to\n&gt; their change frequncies.\n&gt; \n&gt; The proposal can be found here =\r\nhttp://vefsofnun.bok.hi.is/ar/.\n&gt; \n&gt; All feedback, questions, comments and =\r\ngeneral grumbling is welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Kris\n\n\n\n"}}
