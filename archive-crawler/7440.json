How do you make html into plain text? =\r\n\n&gt; There is software that does that, including java libraries (see \n&gt; discu=\r\nssion here \n&gt; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/240546/removing-html-from-=\r\na-java-string). \n&gt; One thing you could do is code a custom writer that uses=\r\n one of these \n&gt; libraries. Then a question is, where does it write? It cou=\r\nld still write \n&gt; to a warc, but if you do that you&#39;ll want to be careful t=\r\nhat what you \n&gt; write conforms to the warc spec. If not warc, then you will=\r\n have to come \n&gt; up with some other system, which may not be trivial.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIt might make more sense to convert to plain text outside of heritrix, \n&gt; b=\r\ny running some postprocessing on the warcs, although that probably also \n&gt; =\r\nwill not be trivial.\n&gt; \n&gt; Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/07/2011 05:02 AM, karthiksmv wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; I am using heritrix to crawl web pages and it stores information lik=\r\ne response headers and html tags but I need to remove the response headers =\r\nand html tags.
