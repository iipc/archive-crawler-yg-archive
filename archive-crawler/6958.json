(If choosing to be open like that, choosing strong admin \ncredentials and monitoring the _out.log for evidence of attempts at \nunauthorized access is all the more important.)\n\nMore likely, something specific to the machine or EC2 network \nconfiguration is the cause.\n\nI suggest eliminating Heritrix from the diagnosis by running something \nelse to listen on the test port, and verify connectivity. The tool \n&#39;netcat&#39; (aka &#39;nc&#39;) is helpful for this.\n\nFor example, on the ec2 node:\n\nec2hostname$ echo hello | nc -l -p 9443\n\n From remote:\n\n$ nc ec2hostname 9443\n[type something]\n\nIf you see the sent text on each side, TCP connections are working. If \nnot, it&#39;s not a Heritrix issue.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\nOn 1/3/11 11:29 PM, yotpo.official wrote:\n&gt; Hi I am trying to Access my Heritrix from my local computer.\n&gt; I have a problem I can&#39;t run Heritrix to open all IP, so The port I want to connect to is open, but I cant access it.\n&gt; I am running it with the flag &quot;-b/&quot;, what is my problem?\n&gt; Thank you\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
