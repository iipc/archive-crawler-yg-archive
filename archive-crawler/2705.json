These internal APIs are \n&gt; likely to change making your e=\r\nmbedding of Heritrix brittle.  The direct \n&gt; creation of CrawlJobHandler wi=\r\nth calls to #getJob is how our Danish \n&gt; compa=F1eros embed the crawler.  T=\r\nhey did it this way because at the time \n&gt; there was no other means availab=\r\nle to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Since then we&#39;ve added a public &#39;remote control&#39; API avail=\r\nable via JMX. \n&gt; I&#39;d suggest you use the API since it is more immune to cha=\r\nnge (Least, \n&gt; we&#39;ll be more careful making changes on this interface.  Ser=\r\nvices \n&gt; running here at the Archive depend on it being constant so we&#39;re e=\r\nven \n&gt; less likely to change it).\n\nHi Michael,\n\nWe&#39;ve been putting JMX thro=\r\nugh some paces and found areas where embedding\nappears to give us functiona=\r\nlity that may be more smoothly obtained than\nwith JMX.  It may due to our l=\r\nimited understanding, but some of the JMX\nreporting and job control stuff w=\r\nas feeling a little clunky.\n\nBefore asking you anything substantive, I&#39;d li=\r\nke to work up a better\nstatement of my thinking, and I&#39;m wondering if in th=\r\ne meantime you all\nhave started a wishlist of proposed enhancements to JMX.=\r\n\n\n-John\r\n--813754568-1036034098-1140720999=:27095--\r\n\n"}}
