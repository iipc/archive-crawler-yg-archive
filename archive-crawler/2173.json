Is it \n&gt; possible to copy my Jobs and Profiles over from 1.4.0?\n\nYou&#39;ll have to make a manual edit to your jobs and profiles.  Here is \nfrom the release notes for the as yet unreleased 1.6.0 version (For some \nreason they&#39;re not making it into the version published at \ncrawler.archive.org -- I need to look at that):\n\n        &quot;The Postselector has been refactored out of existence.\n        Its responsibilities have been parcelled out to two new Processors:\n        LinksScoper and FrontierScheduler. LinksScoper is responsible for\n        scope checking of extracted links. FrontierScheduler does the\n        scheduling of URIs with the Frontier.\n\n        &quot;This change was done to allow introduction of processors\n        between scope checking and Frontier scheduling steps.\n\n        &quot;Because of this change, order files from 1.4.0 Heritrix or\n        before will need to be updated -- Postselector references replaced\n        by LinkScoper and FrontierScheduler references  -- before they\n        can be used with Heritrix 1.6.0 (Referencing a non-existent\n        Postselector in an order file usually shows as -50 fetch status\n        in crawl.log).&quot;\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using Blackdown (i.e. Sun) Java 1.4.2 on Debian. I assume this is \n&gt; sufficient and supported (since it seems to work).  Is that correct?\n&gt;\nThat should be fine.\n\n&gt; Finally, when I connect through the Web interface and hit the &quot;Help&quot; \n&gt; link, I find the &quot;User Manual&quot; and &quot;Developer Manual&quot; links do not \n&gt; work (&quot;HTTP ERROR: 404 Not Found&quot;). I assume they should work. I \n&gt; haven&#39;t worked with maven/eclipse/java before, but it looks to me like \n&gt; the manuals are being packaged with the source distribution but not \n&gt; the binary distribution. Can anyone tell me if these manuals are \n&gt; updated from the 1.4.0 manuals?\n\nThis is a bug.  Thanks for reporting it.  I made an issue to fix it.  \nMeantime, see the manuals up on crawler.archive.org.\n\nThe manuals between 1.4.0 and whats up on crawler.archive.org have \nchanged little.   For the dev manual, the above mentioned refactoring of \nPostselector has been noted as well as miscellanous new additions (Do a \nCVS log to see whats changed since the 1.4.0 branch).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
