The important things functionally are that (1) you&#39;re \nusing the right base version of the Apache library (which the Maven \ndeclarations should handle); (2) the alternate classes in our source \ntree are *earlier in your effective classpath* than the originals.\n\nThe changes we made are all marked with comments like &quot;IA CHANGE&quot; or \n&quot;HERITRIX CHANGE&quot;. After a quick glance through them to refresh my \nmemory, I see they concern:\n\n� injecting our socket-stream &#39;recording&#39; wrappers, to get a verbatim \ncopy of the protocol traffic for later processing/writing\n� better support for giant Cookie maps (as necessary in large crawls), \nby allowing replacement of the implementing map class, and a more \nefficient relevant-key-range lookup\n� being more tolerant of some URI characters tolerated by browsers but \npreviously rejected by the spec-centric Apache code\n� noting rather than throwing-as-failure some header anomalies that \n(again) are tolerated by browsers but previously rejected by the \nspec-centric Apache header-parsing code\n� replacing some bottleneck synchronized maps with less-bottlenecked \nconcurrency-friendly versions\n\nLots of things would break without these changes, so I think you&#39;d \nnotice right away if running a crawl with the wrong (original) classes \nfirst in your classpath.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 2/1/13 4:04 AM, jacksonandrew384 wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to work through and understand the H3 codebase, but I&#39;m having problems with the Apache Commons HttpClient Overlay. I understand the concept - it&#39;s a patched version of the original - but I can&#39;t find the modifications or any description of the actual issues that are being resolved.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I just compile H3 against the vanilla Apache library, will H3 fail? What will go wrong? Does anyone know anything about what this overlay does?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Andy Jackson\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
