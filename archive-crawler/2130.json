I am using PathScope, BdbFrontier, &quot;delay-factor&quot; set to 0,\n&quot;min-delay-ms&quot; 0, &quot;ip-politeness&quot; false. How do I set more toe threads\nto work even when downloading only from one or few domains?\nIf I see right, &quot;Host-valence&quot; is not available in BdbFrontier. Shell I\nuse different frotier instead?\n\n2) When using limited scopes like DomainScope or PathScope some\ndocuments (like embeds) from outside the scope get downloaded even when\n&quot;Preselector/recheck-scope&quot; option is true.\nHow not to download documents, robots.txt or dns records outside the\nscope at all?\n\nBest regards,\n\nVojtech Brozka\n\n\n"}}
