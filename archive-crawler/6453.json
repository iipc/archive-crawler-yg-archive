You can drop a \n&#39;.seeds&#39; file into the job&#39;s &#39;action&#39; directory, and the crawler will \nnotice the file, treat it the same as a start-of-crawl seeds file, then \nmove the file (with a timestamped suffix) to the &#39;done&#39; subdirectory. See:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Action+Directory\n\n(ActionDirectory is an optional bean for H3 configurations, but our \nrecommended default configuration already includes it.)\n\nNote that because of order-of-discovery and path-of-discovery issues, \nadding seeds mid-crawl may not have the exact same effect as having them \npresent at the start.\n\nThis is a subtle issue, and often not a major concern, but important to \nunderstand if concerned about the precision of your crawl scoping, and \nregularly modifying the crawl&#39;s effective scope after it starts.\n\nTo better understand, consider a site A, which has a several-links-deep \npage A&#39;, which redirects to page B&#39;. Assume our default configuration.\n\nIf the root page of A is a seed, then our usual rules consider all other \npages on A as being in-scope. We also rule-in URIs that appear necessary \nto render pages on A (included as IMG/SCRIPT/STYLE/FRAME sources or \nreferenced inside Javascript strings), and URIs that are the immediate \ntargets of redirects from pages on A (treat them &quot;as if&quot; they were the \nsource URI).\n\nEven if site B was not initially in-scope, page B&#39; is ruled in-scope, \nand fetched (along with its own inline resources), when discovered via \nthe redirect from A&#39;. However, other pages on B, even if the target of \nA/@HREF links on page B&#39;, will not be crawled.\n\nIf you then, later in the crawl, add the root page of B, then from that \npoint on all pages on B will be considered in-scope. However, page B&#39; \nwill not be reevaluated. If another link to it is discovered, that path \nis ignored -- because the target URI, B&#39;, was previously discovered (and \ncrawled). If there are pages on B that can only be discovered through \nB&#39;, they will not be found. (If there are other paths to these pages, \nthey will be found -- failing scope-testing once doesn&#39;t prevent a URI \nfrom being retested and enqueued later, only being previously enqueued \nprevents re-enqueueing.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\nOn 4/5/10 10:17 AM, Greg Lu wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to add seed urls to a job, mid crawl, in Heritrix 3.
