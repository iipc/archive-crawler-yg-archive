If just some, is\nthere any pattern to those it gets and those it doesn&#39;t?\n\nI see that there is still a bug in the EasyGarden robots.txt:\nthere should be only one &quot;User-Agent: *&quot; directive, with\nmutliple &quot;Disallow:&quot;s after it. Could this be the issue?\n\n&gt; It&#39;s \n&gt; also adding &quot;%22&quot; after some of the directories, for example,\n&gt; crawl08.archive.org/access/%22, which results in 404s, but it is getting \n&gt; the correct URL crawl08.archive.org/access/.\n\n%22 is the URI-encoding for double-quotes (&quot;). I would normally\nexpect this might be triggered by an unmatched set of quotes,\nlike:\n\n  &lt;a href=/access&quot;&gt;blah&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHowever, I can&#39;t find any such in the garden pages. Perhaps it&#39;s\na misparsing of the empty URIs inside /access/index.html:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIt&#39;s a bug to be filed in any case, good catch.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
