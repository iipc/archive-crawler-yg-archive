I have modified the ant script a bit to suit the present \n&gt; Anecdote structure and activated a cronjob over it. I have also added you \n&gt; and Raymie to the notification mail-ids list so that you would also get \n&gt; the nightly build mails. You could get the nightly build from the \n&gt; location &quot;/home/users/w/wc/wcr-team/NightlyBuilds&quot; as stated in the mail \n&gt; on shell.sourceforge.net. You could use your own logins and do SFTP to \n&gt; access the NightlyBuilds directory. It has read permissions for all.\n\nThis looks good; I&#39;ve been getting the notifications. \n\n&gt; - I am not sure why the stata labs libraries ( st.ata.* packages) have \n&gt; been checked in as a separate CVS module. Are we planning to upgrade/modify \n&gt; those sources and maintain ourselves. If not, we could just have the built \n&gt; classes in a jar in CVS lib directory as we had done for other third party \n&gt; libraries. Otherwise, if we want to maintain it, then would we require that \n&gt; to be a separate CVS module ? I think it would be better if we have one CVS \n&gt; root module under which everything is put in. Probably, in such cases, we \n&gt; can have a &quot;thiryPartySrc&quot; directory to maintain such sources within our \n&gt; main module &quot;OpenWebCrawler&quot; itself.\n\nI just wanted to get those in somewhere since they were necessary to \nrun the Anecdote prototype -- don&#39;t yet have any opinion on how they \nshould be integrated to the main project, if we use them and/or\nrev/extend them.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
