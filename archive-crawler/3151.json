Am I right in assuming the Add URIs section\n&gt;  &gt; allows users to add URIs directly to the frontier? What advantage\n&gt;  &gt; would there be to doing this instead of adding the URIs as additional \n&gt; seeds?\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeds often have special treatment, for example by changing the\n&gt; crawl&#39;s scope -- so you might want to add URIs that are not\n&gt; treated specially.\n&gt; \n&gt; Note that if you use the &#39;crawl.log style&#39; or &#39;recovery journal\n&gt; style&#39;, the URIs you add can have a &#39;via&#39; URI and &#39;hops-path&#39;,\n&gt; adding more context than a plain seed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if &#39;force revisit&#39; is checked, the URIs added will be\n&gt; scheduled even if they&#39;ve already been previously scheduled (and\n&gt; either fetched or waiting to be fetched). So for example a series\n&gt; of connection-errors noted in the crawl.log due to a site that was\n&gt; temporarily unresponsive can be fed back into a running crawl with\n&gt; this facility.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; In the Add URIs section, there&#39;s a text box that is labeled &quot;Import from\n&gt;  &gt; file:&quot;. I created a text file and specified the path to the file\n&gt;  &gt; (C:&#92;temp&#92;urls.txt), but when I clicked on &quot;Import URIs&quot;, it generated an\n&gt;  &gt; error:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Failed to get inputstream from C:&#92;temp&#92;urls.txt\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; and a SEVERE alert. Is there something else that I should be typing in\n&gt;  &gt; this box?\n&gt; \n&gt; A path is correct. Perhaps you need to use backslashes on Windows?\n&gt; (I&#39;m also not sure of the proper drive-based path syntax on\n&gt; Windows.) You could also try using a relative path -- I believe\n&gt; the HERITRIX_HOME directory would be the base to consider.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; There&#39;s no Browse button, so that makes me think that it\n&gt;  &gt; really isn&#39;t expecting an actual file path here.\n&gt; \n&gt; A &#39;Browse&#39; button wouldonly appear for a file-upload option,\n&gt; requesting a local path to upload to the crawler. This option\n&gt; instead grabs a file from local to the crawler. A file-upload\n&gt; option would be a nice addition.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; There&#39;s also no &quot;?&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; link which would tell the field is for.\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; I tried looking for some info about the Add URIs section in the User\n&gt;  &gt; Manual but couldn&#39;t find anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is poorly-documented.
