Specifically, in this contrast:\n\nCase 1:\nSeed: &quot;www.domain.com&quot;\nIN scope: &quot;otherhost.domain.com&quot;\n\nCase 2:\nSeed: &quot;department.domain.com&quot;\nNOT IN scope: &quot;otherhost.domain.com&quot;\n\nIt has been natural (but wrong) for us to think of DomainScope as \ntreating the domain immediately above the top level as special, and thus \nassuming it would handle Case 2, even though the documentation is clear \nthat it merely strips any leading &#39;wwwN&#39; prefix, and thus doesn&#39;t.  So, \nto get this behavior, is it more correct to change DomainScope, or to \nmake a new, different scope?\n\nI suppose you can&#39;t really implement this change to the DomainScope \nrules without defining exhaustively &quot;top level domains&quot; for the rules&#39; \npurposes exhaustively (&quot;.com&quot;, &quot;.is&quot;, but also &quot;.co.uk&quot;, &quot;.edu.au&quot;), \nsince I think the rule inherently wants to be expressed in reference to \nthe domain immediately past top level.  (I think I remember Gordon \nmaking this point sometime in the past.)\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nAndy Boyko    aboy@...     Library of Congress\n\n"}}
