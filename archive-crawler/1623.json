So i thought that\n&gt; this might be connected with the dnsjava-dependency.\n&gt; Looking into the readme of dnsjava i found the\n&gt; following statement:\n&gt; \n&gt; If the underlying OS is Windows, winipcfg/ipconfig can\n&gt; be called and the output parsed.  Note that this may\n&gt; fail for non-English versions of Windows. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m using the english version of windows on my comp\n&gt; and on the other computer i tried to run heritrix at\n&gt; home. The prof has the german version of windows xp,\n&gt; so i guess that&#39;s what causing all the troubles with\n&gt; heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; So now my question is how can this problem be solved??\n\nA feature recently introduced (in CVS HEAD) to work around\nanother DNSJava-related limitation might help in your case,\nas well. See:\n\n   https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1116204&group_id=73833&atid=539099\n\nIf you set the &#39;accept-non-dns-resolves&#39; expert setting of\nthe FetchDNS processor to true, Heritrix will fall back to\nnativelocal name lookups, rather than using DNS itself. This\nmight succeed where DNSJava is failing, allowing your crawl\nto proceed.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
