Please let us know if you ever \nsuspect any problems and we&#39;ll investigate right away.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nMatthew Warhaftig wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Takeru,\n&gt; \n&gt; Heritrix automatically converts Internationalized Domain Name seeds and \n&gt; discovered links to punycode.  However, I recreated your issue of \n&gt; certain IDN seeds getting ignored and in response opened HER-1711 \n&gt; &lt;https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1711&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Non-ASCII character s in the file path to Heritrix is not a problem. \n&gt;  Also, I did not encounter any other IDN related issues during my testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Matt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Nov 16, 2009, at 6:27 AM, takeru sasaki wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to know about IDN support of heritrix.\n&gt;&gt; (&quot;Internationalized domain name&quot;\n&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Domain_Name \n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Domain_Name&gt;)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I was tried to add Japanese-IDN host to seeds, and failed to crawl.\n&gt;&gt; At &quot;seed report&quot; page, I met this message.\n&gt;&gt; ----- http://myheritrix/reports/seeds.jsp?job=xxxxxxx \n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://myheritrix/reports/seeds.jsp?job=xxxxxxx&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some items in seed specification were ignored.
