I am a new member in the group, and I have\n&gt; been using the Heritrix software for some time now.\n&gt;\nGood.\n\n&gt; I have a question:\n&gt;\n&gt; Assuming that I have a list of seeds (eg.100 seeds), and I want to\n&gt; download the pages that are 1 level after these seeds, and not the\n&gt; actuals seeds. Is there any specific comination of Link hops and or\n&gt; Trans hops I need to follow?\n&gt;\n&gt; As I am not interested in having an extra 100 pages (the seeds) that\n&gt; are  causing a problem to the quality of the actual download, I want\n&gt; to use them as a mere start point from which the Heritrix, should\n&gt; download the pages that come from the links within each seed.\n&gt;\nOne suggestion is to add a filter on ARCWriter.  This filter would look \nto see if current CrawlURI is a seed.  If a seed, the filter would pass \non the writing of the seed to an ARC.\n\nDownside is that no such filter currently exists.  You&#39;ll have to write \none.  If you write it as a DecideRule, we&#39;ll add it into the \ndistribution. Or, Igor suggests a more general approach. Write a \nDecideRule that does a lookup into an external file or db to see if the \nitem should be included/excluded.  If you write such a DR, we&#39;ll gladly \nadd that to the distribution too.\n\nGood luck.\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; Thank you in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
