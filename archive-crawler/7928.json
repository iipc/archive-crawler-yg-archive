For the initial start do I really have  to use a seeds file or =\r\nis \n&gt; there a way to tell heritrix to check the actionfolder when the job i=\r\ns \n&gt; started?\n\nIf I&#39;m not missing something, Heritrix checks the action fol=\r\nder every time you start the job (in addition to the periodic checks, of co=\r\nurse)\n\n&gt; 2. What possibilities do I have when the job finished before I can=\r\n add \n&gt; new seeds to the action dir or if the job finished before it checke=\r\nd the \n&gt; action dir again?\n\nYou can tell Heritrix to keep running a job eve=\r\nn though there are no more URLs to crawl. To do that, just set to true the =\r\nsetting &#39;runWhileEmpty&#39; under the &#39;crawlController&#39; bean. For instance:\n\n&lt;b=\r\nean id=3D&quot;crawlController&quot; \n   class=3D&quot;org.archive.crawler.framework.Crawl=\r\nController&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;property name=3D&quot;maxToeThreads&quot; value=3D&quot;250&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;!-- &lt;pr=\r\noperty name=3D&quot;pauseAtStart&quot; value=3D&quot;true&quot; /&gt; --&gt;\n  &lt;property name=3D&quot;runW=\r\nhileEmpty&quot; value=3D&quot;true&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;!-- &lt;property name=3D&quot;recorderInBufferBytes=\r\n&quot; value=3D&quot;524288&quot; /&gt; --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- &lt;property name=3D&quot;recorderOutBufferBytes&quot; =\r\nvalue=3D&quot;16384&quot; /&gt; --&gt;\n  &lt;!-- &lt;property name=3D&quot;scratchDir&quot; value=3D&quot;scratc=\r\nh&quot; /&gt; --&gt;\n &lt;/bean&gt;\n\nI think that&#39;s the only thing you need to keep crawling=\r\n new URLs whenever you add new seeds to the action directory.\n\nBest,\n\nJuan =\r\nManuel Caicedo \n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Markus.Mirsberger=\r\n&quot;  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Id like to constantly crawl new domains and add them=\r\n to the job by using \n&gt; the action directory.\n&gt; I dont want add all my doma=\r\nins to the seed file becuase that are too \n&gt; many and there are new domains=\r\n added all the time.\n&gt; So my application checks the crawling speed from tim=\r\ne to time and if it \n&gt; is too low and no .seeds file in the action dir Ill =\r\nadd a new seedfile.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.
