We wi=\r\nll not use other\n&gt; &gt; indexing than our own.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some particular questi=\r\nons:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     * Which crawler will handle crawling for images best?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n     * Which crawler will best adapt to a distributed crawling system,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nin which we use many servers conducting crawling together?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Right n=\r\now these look like the 3 best options-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     * Nutch: Known to scale=\r\n. Doesn&#39;t look like the best option because\n&gt; &gt; it seems that is it tied cl=\r\nosely to their text searching software.\n&gt; &gt;     * Heritrix: Also scales. Th=\r\nis one currently looks like the best\n&gt; &gt; option.\n&gt; &gt;     * Scrapy: Has not =\r\nbeen used on a large scale (not sure though). I\n&gt; &gt; dont know if it has the=\r\n basic stuff like URL canonicalization. I would\n&gt; &gt; like to use this one be=\r\ncause it is a python framework (I like python\n&gt; &gt; more than java), but I do=\r\nn&#39;t know if they have implemented the\n&gt; &gt; advanced features of a web crawle=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Summary:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We need to get as many images as possible fro=\r\nm the web. Which existing\n&gt; &gt; crawling framework is both scalable and effic=\r\nient , but also the one\n&gt; &gt; which will be the easiest to modify to get only=\r\n images?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
