Comment lines begin with &#39;#&#39;.&quot;\n\nWhen I view the settings after setting some seeds, however, it says,\n&quot;Seed list too large to edit&quot; under seeds, with the words &quot;seed list&quot;\nlinking to what I put in the seeds box.  This happens even if we only\nlist one seed.  What is going on?\n\n---\n\nAlso, we&#39;re trying to retrieve files from a secure server (using the\nRfc2617 credentials).  When the credentials are wrong, we get a 401\nerror as expected.  However, when the credentials are correct, it\nhangs while trying to retrieve robots.txt (which is not on the\nserver).  On a non-secure server, things worked fine (it would get a\n404 error while trying to retrieve robots.txt, then move on to\nretrieving the desired files).\n\nHere&#39;s the stack trace:\njava.io.IOException: mark/reset not supported\n    at java.io.InputStream.reset(InputStream.java:331)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpConnection.isResponseAvailable(HttpConnection.java:876)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager$HttpConnectionAdapter.isResponseAvailable(MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.java:1303)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponseBody(HttpMethodBase.java:1695)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponseBody(HttpMethodBase.java:1638)\n    at org.archive.httpclient.HttpRecorderGetMethod.readResponseBody(HttpRecorderGetMethod.java:98)\n    at org.archive.crawler.fetcher.FetchHTTP$2.readResponseBody(FetchHTTP.java:294)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponse(HttpMethodBase.java:1601)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.execute(HttpMethodBase.java:999)\n    at org.archive.httpclient.HttpRecorderGetMethod.execute(HttpRecorderGetMethod.java:116)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeWithRetry(HttpMethodDirector.java:382)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeMethod(HttpMethodDirector.java:168)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:393)\n    at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:324)\n    at org.archive.crawler.fetcher.FetchHTTP.innerProcess(FetchHTTP.java:307)\n    at org.archive.crawler.framework.Processor.process(Processor.java:102)\n    at org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.processCrawlUri(ToeThread.java:273)\n    at org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.run(ToeThread.java:143)\n\nThanks,\n-Samuel Freilich\n\n"}}
