We will also work to have calls in \npairs, so that there are times convenient for both European and Pacific \ntimezones.\n\nThe first call will occur via a &#39;Skypecast&#39;, at the following time:\n\n1500GMT Wednesday May 28th\n   (8a San Francisco / 11a WashingtonDC / 4p London)\n\nThe call will open with a brief overview of what&#39;s new in the latest \nHeritrix releases (1.14.0 and 2.0.0), and some of the priorities for \nfuture releases. Then, it will be an open discussion of whatever \nparticipants want to talk about.\n\nParticipating in the Skypecast only requires a current version of Skype \nto participate, and accommodates up to 100 participants (with facilities \nfor the moderator to rotate people into speaking positions).\n\nEveryone using or interested in web harvesting with Heritrix is welcome \nto participate. Latest info, including a link to the Skypecast page \nwhich allows joining the call, will live at this Heritrix wiki page:\n\n   http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Community+Calls\n\nJoin us!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
