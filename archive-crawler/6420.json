My task would be to archiv=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; only certain pages in a crawl job, i.e., I want to give Heritrix a li=\r\nst of URLs referring to one page each and I want them to be collected (incl=\r\nuding all components of that page (e.g., PDF files, images, ...). Anybody h=\r\nere which could give me a hint / sample job definition?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you v=\r\nery much in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; Roughy, this can be achieved by:\n&gt;\n&gt; - using the bu=\r\nndled default configuration\n&gt;\n&gt; - including all your URLs of interest as &#39;s=\r\needs&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt; - setting the &#39;maxHops&#39; value of the TooManyHopsDecideRule to &#39;0&#39;=\r\n,\n&gt; meaning &quot;don&#39;t follow links more than 0 hops from seeds&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The follow=\r\ning TransclusionDecideRule will still rule-in items that are\n&gt; obviously re=\r\nquired to inline-render the page (such as\n&gt; FRAME/IMG/STYLE/SCRIPT SRC link=\r\ns) or even possibly-required (in the case\n&gt; of URL-looking strings in certa=\r\nin form elements and scripts).\n&gt;\n&gt; So, the overall effect is: get exactly t=\r\nhe URLs provided as seeds, plus\n&gt; those things definitely necessary to rend=\r\ner them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Note: &quot;A HREF&quot; links, whether to resources on the same site or=\r\n different\n&gt; sites, won&#39;t be ruled-in. (They&#39;ll all be considered &#39;1&#39; hop o=\r\nut, more\n&gt; than &#39;0&#39; hops.) So if you have a page full of links to PDF files=\r\n or\n&gt; photos or whatever, those links won&#39;t be followed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some options t=\r\no consider if you want to get those:\n&gt;\n&gt; - increase the &#39;maxHops&#39; to 1 -- t=\r\nhis will at least follow links into\n&gt; the same sites/site-prefixes implied =\r\nby the seeds\n&gt;\n&gt; - add an extra MatchesRegexPatternDecideRule, late in the =\r\nscope, to\n&gt; ACCEPT all URLs with certain desired patterns (such as ending &quot;=\r\n.pdf&quot;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
