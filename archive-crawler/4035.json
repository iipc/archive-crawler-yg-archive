Was this also fixed post 1.8?\n\nHeritrix asks the system for its time using standard Java functions, \nthen asks to format that time as a GMT time. With the behavior you&#39;re \nseeing, some aspect of your host system may be confused into thinking \nthat (1) it is in GMT; and (2) it thinks GMT time is EST.\n\nIf the system is misconfigured and you can&#39;t change it, you *might* be \nable to work around the system via the Java &#39;user.timezone&#39; property.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
