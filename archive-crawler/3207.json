It performs two tests. First, it looks if\n&gt; &gt; the environment variable JAVA_HOME is set (to find out yourself,\n&gt; &gt; type &#39;echo $JAVA_HOME&#39;). In case if not, the script looks for a\n&gt; &gt; &#39;java&#39; executable in the search path (type &#39;which java&#39;). If both\n&gt; &gt; tests fail, the script exits saying &#39;Cannot find JAVA. Please set\n&gt; &gt; JAVA_HOME or your PATH&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I guess you either have a java installation which doesn&#39;t work\n&gt; &gt; correctly anymore or java has been incompletely deinstalled or\n&gt; &gt; heritrix has a problem to run under the given environment of that\n&gt; &gt; machine. Also keep in mind that heritrix needs java version 1.5.0+.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So long,\n&gt; &gt; Bert\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Message de : mark &lt;mark@... &lt;mailto:mark%40junklight.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 23/08/2006 10:43\n&gt; &gt; Envoy� par :\n&gt; &gt; archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:archive-crawler%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Veuillez r�pondre � archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:archive-crawler%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pour\n&gt; &gt; archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:archive-crawler%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Copie\n&gt; &gt; Objet\n&gt; &gt; [archive-crawler] Grrrr (a request!)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have been using Heritirx on a lots of different machine recently\n&gt; &gt; and one thing that drives me mad is if java is not installed on a\n&gt; &gt; machine it just sits there printing &quot;.&quot;&#39;s rather than telling you\n&gt; &gt; there is no Java. I am not a shell script expert but if some one\n&gt; &gt; could add a &quot;please install java&quot; that would be nice (or just fail if\n&gt; &gt; it can&#39;t run it).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know this happens almost never (except to me) but Heritrix is\n&gt; &gt; reaching 1.10 soon and it would add to the all round quality we see\n&gt; &gt; in other areas of the application :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; cheers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; mark\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
