On the first pass I&#39;ll just look at a directory \n&gt; structure\n&gt; that could be build by MirrorWriter.   Once the general idea is proven to\n&gt; work it could be modified to work with ARC files and some kind of\n&gt; database.  I figure on a subsequent pass I&#39;d modify it so that if the \n&gt; local\n&gt; storage has multiple versions of a file the user would be presented \n&gt; with a\n&gt; list of them and s/he could pick the right one.  This idea is not\n&gt; perfect.  the biggest hole that immediately comes to mind is that \n&gt; anything\n&gt; that is likely to be an embed should probably just default to the most\n&gt; recent and that may not be correct.  (sorta like a limited version of the\n&gt; wayback machine, but I&#39;m expecting this to be just a few pages\n&gt; long)  Anyway, as I said, it wont be perfect, but should be usable.\n&gt;\nA proxy server that sat atop a filesystem of MirrorWriter made \ndirectories and files would be a wonderful addition.  Others have done \nproxy servers to sit atop collections of ARCs.  The most mature is \nprobably that done by our Danish brothers, the &#39;ProxyViewer&#39; application \n(See http://www.netarchive.dk/website/sources/index-en.htm).   Another, \nless mature offering, is ARC Server \n(http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/arc-collection-proxy/).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave Skinner   dave at solid dot net\n&gt;     High Performance Programming---assembly (lots of them), C, java, perl\n&gt;     Database and Non-trivial web site implementations\n&gt;     Real-time and embedded systems are my specialty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
