That is, if they report &#39;ACCEPT&#39; or \n&#39;PASS&#39;, that Processor is run. If &#39;REJECT&#39;, that Processor is skipped, \nbut other processing continues.\n\nInside some of the standard Processors, as part of their analysis, they \ncan force subsequent processors to be skipped up to the &quot;postprocessing&quot; \nphase.\n\nFor example, when (in H1) a CrawlURI does not pass the canFetch() test \nin FetchHTTP, the method CrawlURI.skipToProcessorChain() is used to \nensure the CrawlURI skips forward to the wrapup-processing. This is \nindependent on the configurable per-Processor decide-rules.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 3/13/11 8:13 AM, Mohammad Amin Golshani wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; hello\n&gt; in heritrix 1.14.4 if a URL in *Preprocessor#decide-rules *was rejected\n&gt; is it possible the same url in another preprocessor for example *in\n&gt; **fetch-processors * be accepted? or after rejection in any preprocessor\n&gt; the URL completely rejected?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
