In other\n&gt;&gt; words, do not use seeds for scoping.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you, please, briefly explain why not?\n\nThere are several things that I don&#39;t like about it. It is limited to \nURI matching rules, can be confusing and forces you to teach people \napplication specific rules. Heritrix automatic conversion of seeds to \nscope is limited to one to one mapping (one seed equals one URI matching \nscope rule) and the seeds conversion can result in unwanted scope.\n\nTo illustrate this we can use an example from Myspace. Let&#39;s assume that \nwe have the seed bellow as part of a harvest collection that is related \nto Humor News:\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/onionnews\n\nIf we use this seed to define scope within Heritrix we can only achieve \n  host or domain scope. Both of these will expend the scope to \nnon-related content. This seed requires scoping rules that can not be \nderived from the seed alone. We might need scoping rules on depth, \npriority, link type and custom rules specific to the site&#39;s content.\n\n\nIn general, scoping with seeds can be a good and clear shortcut. \nHowever, in long run the shortcuts usually prove to be the longest \ndistances between two points :)\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; This can be achieved by using scope directives either mixed with seeds \n&gt;&gt; or in a separate scope source.
