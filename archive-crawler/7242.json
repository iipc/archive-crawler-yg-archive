It&#39;s just, it has been really useful for me so far, as I automatically schedule seeds from a database, and when a job is finished, it just gets paused, and when a new seed entry is inserted into the DB, it is scheduled and the frontier is unpaused automatically.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any other ways setting that &quot;pauseAtFinish&quot; parameter?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; progre55\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
