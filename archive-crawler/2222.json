So, when such values look like they could\nbe URIs -- have a &#39;.&#39; or &#39;/&#39; in them -- Heritrix tries them. Usually, trying\na few bad URIs has little cost to either the crawler or the target site,\nand we would rather err on the side of inclusion.\n\nIn some cases, this has caused inconveniences -- large numbers of error\nfetches in crawler or remote server logs, or auto-notification messages to\nwebmasters. We&#39;ve corrected these on a site-by-site basis so far.\n\nHowever, there&#39;s an outstanding RFE to make the aggressiveness of the HTML\n(and possibly other) extractors more configurable. See:\n\n   [ 913002 ] Extractor aggressiveness needs to be configurable\n   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=913002&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\nIt shouldn&#39;t be too hard but it hasn&#39;t yet been assigned anyone or\ntargetted for a release -- we&#39;d welcome a code contribution if anyone\nwould like to tackle this, or has interesting ideas on what levels of\naggressiveness should be selectable.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nryanatl wrote:\n&gt; Using: heritrix-1.5.1-200509291859\n&gt; \n&gt; Heritrix tried to crawl this URL:\n&gt; http://www.anns-personalized-books.com/jiff/my_zoo_rhymes/my-zoo-rhymes-page.htm\n&gt; \n&gt; And then proceeded to try to \n&gt; GET /jiff/my_zoo_rhymes/service@...\n&gt; \n&gt; If you view the source to my-zoo-rhymes-page.htm, you&#39;ll see a hidden value field with the \n&gt; email address in question as a value, but no where else on the page.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve also seen this behavior with HTML select statements, where Heritrix will try to GET URLs \n&gt; for every option value parameter.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
