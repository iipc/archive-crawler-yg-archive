As the c=\r\nonfiguration is now done through a spring application context, a PropertyOv=\r\nerrideConfigurer can be used to override almost everything. So is there is =\r\na reason for the keyedProperties?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I may be missing something.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n KeyedProperties implements what we now call &#39;overlays&#39; (to avoid \n&gt; confus=\r\nion with Spring&#39;s various &#39;overrides&#39;).\n&gt; \n&gt; It allows the value of a setti=\r\nng to vary based on the context -- usually \n&gt;   triggered off the URI-in-pr=\r\nogress and current thread -- in which it is \n&gt; checked.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, i=\r\nt allows the frontier &#39;minDelayMs&#39; to be the default for \n&gt; most URIs, but =\r\nthen for some subset of URIs, usually defined by a SURT \n&gt; prefix, assume s=\r\nome other value.\n&gt; \n&gt; These alternate overlay values are collected in &#39;Shee=\r\nt&#39; beans, and \n&gt; associated with certain SURT-prefixes or other rulesets vi=\r\na \n&gt; &#39;SheetAssociation&#39; beans. (You would only need to consider \n&gt; KeyedPro=\r\nperties yourself if implementing your own components that want \n&gt; to offer =\r\n&#39;overlayable&#39; settings.)\n&gt; \n&gt; See this part of the H3 User Guide for more d=\r\netails:\n&gt; \n&gt; https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Sheets\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n- Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bertrand\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
