It is not intuitively obvious how to set things up.\nUntil you get pretty familiar with how spring works, then you can drop \nin beans to the XML, and go wild.\nBut the curve on that is steep for the non-programmer.\n\nYes, you guess, and go look at source code, and see what the \nmethod/function expects, fail a few times, and get\nbetter.\n\n1.14 is still a fine crawler, though I prefer the 1.15.4 nightly build, \nI&#39;ve recommended they make\nthat the release.\n\nSo, the scoop is still, figure out what you want to do, and go.\nI use them both, depending on the game at hand.\n(Not to mention other tools.)\n\nJohn\n\n\n\nLance Riedel wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; As a newbie, which version should we get going on?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been trying out version 1.14 and got a few crawls working.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was then looking at 3.0 due to the fact that some of the new \n&gt; features sound interesting (like scalable re-crawls), and figuring \n&gt; that is where most of the development effort is heading.\n&gt;\n&gt; That said, I&#39;m having much more trouble getting going with the \n&gt; Documentation in 3.0 (especially how to configure the XML) and I feel \n&gt; like I&#39;m guessing at things and trying them out way to much (where as \n&gt; 1.14 was fairly straight forward to get going on).\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I was getting NPE exception with 3.0 RC 1, and had to go to a \n&gt; nightly build, which then worked.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the scoop?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Lance\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
