Does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone have any suggestion on how to do this , where I should look to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; place my methods?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Are you interested in that specifically to get away from ARC, or more \n&gt; &gt; simply because you&#39;re interested in being able to issue queries on the \n&gt; &gt; crawl results in interesting/relational ways?  I ask because we&#39;re \n&gt; &gt; looking into a slightly different approach - rather than building the \n&gt; &gt; database logic into Heritrix, treating the DB import as a \n&gt; &gt; post-processing step on the crawl output (ARC files & logs) once the \n&gt; &gt; crawl is complete.  I believe Tom Emerson has also talked about \n&gt; &gt; populating a DB from ARC files in future versions of his libarc library.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By keeping the content in ARCs, you get the ability to leverage the \n&gt; &gt; growing number of tools for dealing with the format coming from this \n&gt; &gt; community, and if the post-processing approach can work for you, code \n&gt; &gt; for populating a DB may be forthcoming from a couple of sources in the \n&gt; &gt; near future.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can you describe in more detail what you&#39;re envisioning with your \n&gt; &gt; planned DB crawl storage?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Andy Boyko    aboy@l...     Library of Congress\n&gt; \n&gt; We had considered that aswell initially as a quick way of importing\n&gt; the data into the db. Going the arc route after a crawl. But we have a\n&gt; search engine we run that is powered by\n&gt; lucene(http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html). We have our\n&gt; own crawler which has done all it can and is not nearly as powerful as\n&gt; heritrix. So we want to incorporate heritrix into out environment\n&gt; quickly. We make all our indexes off of content stored in the db, and\n&gt; it makes alot of sense for us to just have the crawler populate the db\n&gt; at runtime than have some post crawl method were we do it. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
