Would it be communicating with Heritrix crawler or not?\n\nPlease h=\r\nelp me out from this problem.\n\nWith regards,\nShadab\n\n\n--- In archive-crawle=\r\nr@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristinn Sigurdsson&quot; \n&lt;kris@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Not as =\r\nsuch, although there was an issue with Heritrix builds \nfailing on\n&gt; 2.6 ke=\r\nrnels at some point. Myself, I&#39;m running on Red Hat, but \nthat is\n&gt; simply =\r\nbecause thats what we use here, not because Heritrix runs \nbetter on\n&gt; it. =\r\n(Michael, I think there should be a FAQ entry for this \nquestion). Just\n&gt; m=\r\nake sure you&#39;ve got Java 1.4.2 or better installed and you should \nbe fine.=\r\n \n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. Depends on the hardware. Assuming that there are enough active \n=\r\nqueues\n&gt; (meaning the KB/sec is not limited by politness rules) the crawler=\r\n \nis\n&gt; capable of (in my experiance) going as high 21.1 Mbits/sec (over a \n=\r\nperiod of\n&gt; 24 hours). Peak loads can be higher, especially if you are \ndow=\r\nnloading a lot\n&gt; of larger files. If many crawling text documents, bandwidt=\r\nh usage \ndrops,\n&gt; since each text document is subjected to link extraction =\r\nthat \ntakes time.\n&gt; The throughput in terms of documents per second for the=\r\n 24 hour \nperiod cited\n&gt; above was approx. 57 docs/sec. (about 5 million do=\r\ncs and 214GB of\n&gt; uncompressed data in 24 hours).\n&gt;  \n&gt; The hardware in que=\r\nstion includes dual Xeon processors and 2 gigs \nworth of\n&gt; memory (+ abunda=\r\nnt disk storage). Heritrix likes processor power \nin my\n&gt; experience, its p=\r\nerformance is usually limited by this factor \nalthough\n&gt; additional memory =\r\ncan somewhat improve throughput for high end \nmachines.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. Yep, read =\r\nthe User Manual. It has a section on installation \nand &quot;A quick\n&gt; guide to =\r\nrunning your first crawl job&quot; which should get you up and \nrunning\n&gt; in no =\r\ntime. \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#tutorial\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n- Kris\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; [mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of callforshadab\n&gt;=\r\n Sent: 21. okt=F3ber 2005 11:02\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sub=\r\nject: [archive-crawler] can Anybody tell me, Why should i Use\n&gt; HERITRIX...=\r\n.... ???\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am planning to work with Heritrix.

Is there any specific version or produc=\r\nt of Linux, is required \n&gt; to   work with Heritrix. (I mean RedHat 8.0, 9.0=\r\n OR Fedora Linux \n&gt; etc..)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. what is the performance analysis of Heri=\r\ntrix in terms of KB/sec.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. can i Directly start crawling after downlo=\r\nading and configuring \n&gt; the package.\n&gt; \n&gt; With Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Shadab \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n   &quot;  &quot;\n&gt; ` 0  0 &#39;\n&gt;     ^\n&gt;    WWW\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; YAHO=\r\nO!
