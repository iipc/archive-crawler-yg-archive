I would like to archive lis=\r\nts\nof websites and then scan them for viruses/spyware/malware stuff.\nAnythi=\r\nng found would be added to a blacklist to be shared with various\nsecurity b=\r\nased newsgroups.\n\nThere is also certain javascript code segments I want to =\r\nfind and when I\ndo find them, I would like a list of those sites so I can i=\r\nnvestigate\nthem further.\n\nIs this possible with Heritrix? Is anyone doing t=\r\nhis now? \n\nI read about how the University of Washington did their research=\r\n but it\ndoesn&#39;t provide enough details on exactly how their system was\nsetu=\r\np/configured. I would like to do something like what they did/are\ndoing, bu=\r\nt on an ongoing basis and actually provide lists to various\nsecurity groups=\r\n as well as using it myself.\n\nIs this something the list can assist me with=\r\n? Or should I keep looking\nfor consulting help?\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nThank=\r\n you in advance for your consideration.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: n=\r\notify@yahoogroups.com [mailto:notify@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf\nOf joehung3=\r\n02\nSent: Wednesday, June 14, 2006 2:03 AM\nTo: Thomas Raef\nSubject: Re: Are =\r\nthere any Heritrix consultants out there?\n\nWhy don&#39;t you post your question=\r\ns to the list?
