Though, it would be \ngreat to be in that position.  At this point, I think that we should keep them as is (in your face) \nas a constant reminder that unit tests should/must be written.\n\ni.\n\n\n&gt; In Heritrix, unit tests sit beside the classes tested though the common \n&gt; practise is to keep tests apart from the runtime src, in a directory of \n&gt; tests only.  The original rationale for putting tests beside the classes \n&gt; tested was to avoid having to look in two places for code and as a \n&gt; constant in-the-developers&#39;-face reminder that tests need to be written.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently Christian Kohlschï¿½tter proposed Heritrix do as other projects \n&gt; do and move unit tests to their own directory.  In the main Christian \n&gt; argues a src tree polluted by tests is tough to grok and that as tests \n&gt; proliferate and become more involved -- if we start adding mock objects \n&gt; and test data -- apprehension of Heritrix workings will get harder with \n&gt; time.  His argument in full can be viewed here: \n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1187976&group_id=73833&atid=539102.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do others think?\n&gt; \n&gt; (How about an apache-like +1 if you agree that tests should be moved, -1 \n&gt; if you disagree, and 0 if neutral.  Let majority carry the motion, \n&gt; unless a minority puts up a good fight).\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
