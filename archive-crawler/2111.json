I looked at the crawl.log and I see \n&gt; a whole bunch of my seed URLs with an entry like\n&gt; 2005-08-15T22:19:21.481Z -5000          - \n&gt; http://www.interstaterestoration.com/ - - no-type #095 - - -\n&gt; \n&gt; does that mean no mime-type known, or ?\n&gt; \n&gt; something seems pretty wrong, as I could believe an occasional site gets \n&gt; discarded by here 3/4 of my sites are dropping out\n\nConsulting FetchStatusCodes, -5000 is &quot;S_OUT_OF_SCOPE&quot;, and is only\nset by Preselector -- meaning these URIs were scheduled somehow but\nthen fail to pass scope-testing when first considered for crawling.\n\nSince there&#39;s no &#39;via&#39; or &#39;hops-path&#39; info, I presume this is a\nseed. Have you perhaps set up a scope that does not accept some\nof your seeds?\n\nTwo possibly-relevant open issues:\n\n  Bug [ 1249828 ] -5000 out-of-scope preconditions; -50 failure\n  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1249828&group_id=73833&atid=539099\n  (probably not the cause of your problem, as it affects prerequisites,\n  not seeds themselves)\n\n  Bug [ 1219486 ] no rule for decidingscope to always crawl seeds\n  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1219486&group_id=73833&atid=539099\n  (based on the idea that people might want &#39;seeds&#39; to be definitionally\n  in-scope simply because they&#39;re seeds, even if they wouldn&#39;t otherwise\n  be ruled-in)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;  - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; At 03:26 PM 8/15/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Mike Schwartz wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hi,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I notice that Heretrix 1.5.0 (taken from the HEAD last week) outputs\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a down-counting demonimator in the downloaded/queued document\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ratio.  For example I started a crawl with 2407 seeds, and it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; initially grew as new pages were discovered, but after a few minutes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it reported that I was on page 568 of 593... making it hard to get a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sense of what the real % complete is\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s been this way for a while: URIs that were scheduled, but then\n&gt;&gt; &#39;disregarded&#39; don&#39;t count as either pending or completed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The most notable cause of &#39;disregarded&#39; URIs is those that are\n&gt;&gt; precluded by robots.txt rules -- they get scheduled, but are never\n&gt;&gt; attempted, and so should neither count as successful, failed, or\n&gt;&gt; still-pending.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you&#39;ve added other settings which can cause URIs to be\n&gt;&gt; ignored after having been initially scheduled -- such as\n&gt;&gt; narrowing the scope midcrawl, resulting in URIs that get\n&gt;&gt; ruled out-of-scope on rechecking -- that will also cause\n&gt;&gt; URIs to be disregarded, and the total &#39;queued&#39; will decrease\n&gt;&gt; without the &#39;completed&#39; changing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This area of the crawler needs improvement; the current\n&gt;&gt; tallies of &#39;percent done&#39; and &#39;estimated time remaining&#39;\n&gt;&gt; take no account of the potential for more URIs to be\n&gt;&gt; discovered, and so are almost worse-than-useless.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think tracking the effective rates of discovery versus\n&gt;&gt; completion -- and the rates of change of each -- could\n&gt;&gt; offer more meaningful estimates, for both the whole crawl\n&gt;&gt; and individual queues. Some notes on possible approaches\n&gt;&gt; are on the crawler wiki [*] here:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CrawlAndQueueDynamics&gt;http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CrawlAndQueueDynamics \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But, implementing some of these ideas is not yet a priority\n&gt;&gt; for any upcoming releases, so it would take someone interested\n&gt;&gt; in this area to contribute some code for the situation to\n&gt;&gt; improve in the short term.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [*] Reminder: the crawler wiki edit password is available on\n&gt;&gt; request to any Heritrix users/developers interested in\n&gt;&gt; adding/revising the content.
