This in itself can be tricky,\ndepending on\n&gt; how=\r\n you are defining your crawl. If you post the details of your\ncrawl you\n&gt; m=\r\night get some suggestion on how to split the scope.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Currently, Heritr=\r\nix doesn&#39;t allow for multiple machines working\ntogether and\n&gt; sharing infor=\r\nmation. There are plans to address this, but I believe\nthat it\n&gt; is still q=\r\nuite some time off.\n&gt;  \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: ar=\r\nchive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On=\r\n Behalf Of video_guid\n&gt; Sent: 11. ma=ED 2005 16:41\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [archive-crawler] coordianted crawls\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m i=\r\nnterested in trying to coordinate several different crawlers\n&gt; running heri=\r\ntrix.
