More writers would \n&gt; mean more contention for the disk head possibly holding threads in the \n&gt; write step for longer but iostat at the time didn&#39;t seem to show this as \n&gt; being the issue -- the disk was lightly loaded (Generally we don&#39;t put \n&gt; up much of a disk i/o loading, not unless you disable gzipping).\n\nThat would make sense. Now that you can specify multiple ARC\ndirectories, you could spread writers across multiple drives. One\nthing that I haven&#39;t done in my large crawl is put the logging and\nscratch on separate disks: doing that would certainly help.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
