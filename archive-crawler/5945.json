We will not use other\nindexing than our own.\n\nSome particular questions:\n\n    * Which crawler will handle crawling for images best?\n    * Which crawler will best adapt to a distributed crawling system,\nin which we use many servers conducting crawling together?\n\nRight now these look like the 3 best options-\n\n    * Nutch: Known to scale. Doesn&#39;t look like the best option because\nit seems that is it tied closely to their text searching software.\n    * Heritrix: Also scales. This one currently looks like the best\noption.\n    * Scrapy: Has not been used on a large scale (not sure though). I\ndont know if it has the basic stuff like URL canonicalization. I would\nlike to use this one because it is a python framework (I like python\nmore than java), but I don&#39;t know if they have implemented the\nadvanced features of a web crawler.\n\nSummary:\n\nWe need to get as many images as possible from the web. Which existing\ncrawling framework is both scalable and efficient , but also the one\nwhich will be the easiest to modify to get only images?\n\nThanks!\n\n"}}
