I have used\n&gt;1.2.0 but found the OOM errors to be a bit of a roadblock.  So, I\n&gt;have downloaded and compiled 1.3.0 and am using the bdb.  This seems\n&gt;to have eliminated my oom errors, but performance is very poor.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have loaded up 75,000 seeds into my seed list (after setting up\n&gt;the job but before running it).  The box is a dual 3.06 P4 w/ 2 GB\n&gt;of ram.  I have tested this on SUSE Ent 9 and RHES 3.0 w/ java 1.4.\n&gt;I seem to be crawling about 5-10 pages per second w/ 100 threads.\n&gt;What&#39;s wierd though is that my CPU and disk are not maxed out.  It\n&gt;looks like there&#39;s plenty of resources to spare, but I can&#39;t get it\n&gt;to crawl faster.  Decreasing or increasing the threads makes it\n&gt;worse.  There is plenty of bandwidth available too.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, I noticed that most of the threads are sitting in the\n&gt;postselector in a ABOUT_TO_BEGIN_PROCESSOR state.  Is this normal?\n&gt;Is this my bottleneck?\n&gt;\n&gt;Any help and/or advice would be great.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Greg\n\n\n"}}
