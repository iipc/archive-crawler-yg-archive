I am using H1.14.4.  The fields that I am changing\nin particular are keyword, mysql server, mysql database, mysql user, mysql\npassword. The control interface you are asking (if I am thinking of the\nsame thing) is via xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080 which is the heritrix admin console.\n\nI attached a screenshot, but I don&#39;t know if it will be accessible inside\nthe group.\n\nBased on your questions, I am thinking incorrectly.  I presumed that being\nable to change extractor fields inside the console is standard Heritrix\nfunction by virtue of the extractor being selected as a (writer) processor\nin the module tab.\n\nI am starting to understand that while I can change Heritrix configuration\nsettings within the console, custom extractor specific fields though\nappearing inside the console are not functional without additional\nprogramming to hand off the changes to the .java file and thus recompiling\nof the extractor.\n\nI figured that since I can copy/paste URL seeds directly into the console,\nI could also change the other fields presented to me as well.\n\nIt would be nice to change the fields on the fly inside Heritrix rather\nthan going into the .java file for each run requiring new keyword or mysql\ncredentials( what I do now).  I realize I&#39;ll have to pay for that\nconvenience and talk to my developer if I get to the point of doing\nnumerous custom keyword/mysql projects.\n\nThanks for helping me with this insight.\n\nDavid\n\r\n--f46d040167a1ed708c04c6c6a261\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi Gordon,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your reply.=A0 I am using H1.14.4.=A0 The fiel=\r\nds that I am changing in particular are keyword, mysql server, mysql databa=\r\nse, mysql user, mysql password.
