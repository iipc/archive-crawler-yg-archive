Can this be done with a decide rule or is there maybe\n&gt; already a switch?\n&gt; I am using a seeds file with surts and I only want crawl these Urls and\n&gt; also only want a DNS Lookup for the hosts in this scope.\n&gt;\n&gt; My problem is that I have two domains with identical webserver setup on\n&gt; the same machine. One has alot of external Links and one not.\n&gt; The domain without many external Links can be crawled with about\n&gt; 50Urls/sec and the other one just with 0.5Urls/sec\n&gt; Thats why I think the DNS-Lookup of the outgoing links might cause the\n&gt; speed issue.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Markus\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; Posted by: &quot;Markus.Mirsberger&quot; &lt;markus.mirsberger@...&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
