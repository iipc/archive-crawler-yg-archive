The upshot is we&#39;ll crawl both www.example.org and \nwww0001.example.org as though they were different sites: i.e. lots of \nduplicate crawling.\n\nThe default profile uses StripWWWNRule.\n\nWorkaround is to add the StripWWWRule beside the StripWWWNRule to the \nset of canonicalizations.\n\nWe&#39;ll likely make a point release sometime soon but want to give 1.10.0 \nmore burn-in time to see if anything else ugly makes a show.\n\nYours,\nInternet Archive Webteam.\n\n"}}
