But it&#39;s not yet clear that&#39;s your \nproblem; even one thread fetching as fast as possible (no politeness \n&#39;snoozes&#39;) may fully load your target server, and so adding more threads \nmay just mean they&#39;re competing against themselves (for little if any \nspeedup).\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/27/10 5:02 AM, yotpo.official wrote:\n&gt; What is the reason for this?\n&gt; I am crawling only my own site and there are no politeness considerations,in this way it will take my for ages to index my site...

Looking at the frontier report will reveal\n&gt;&gt; which queue offered the URI, the count of other URIs in that queue, and\n&gt;&gt; other details. Looking at the threads report will reveal the processor\n&gt;&gt; currently working on the in-process URI.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With a single queue still holding URIs, and normal politeness settings,\n&gt;&gt; you would expect on subsequent viewings of this summary to see the queue\n&gt;&gt; bouncing from &#39;in-process&#39; to &#39;snoozed&#39; and back, until the queue is\n&gt;&gt; exhausted. If occasionally new URIs are discovered on other hosts, other\n&gt;&gt; queues might reenter active crawling as well.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 12/26/10 10:00 AM, yotpo.official wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am running with 10 threads and 10 queues and this is my frontier summary after a while:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;    RUN - 11 URI queues: 1 active (1 in-process; 0 ready; 0 snoozed); 0 inactive; 0 ineligible; 0 retired; 10 exhausted\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Anybody knows why is it happening?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you very much\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
