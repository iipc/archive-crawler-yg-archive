Not as such, although there was an issue=\r\n with Heritrix builds \nfailing on\n&gt; 2.6 kernels at some point. Myself, I&#39;m =\r\nrunning on Red Hat, but \nthat is\n&gt; simply because thats what we use here, n=\r\not because Heritrix runs \nbetter on\n&gt; it. (Michael, I think there should be=\r\n a FAQ entry for this \nquestion). Just\n&gt; make sure you&#39;ve got Java 1.4.2 or=\r\n better installed and you should \nbe fine. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. Depends on the hardwar=\r\ne. Assuming that there are enough active \nqueues\n&gt; (meaning the KB/sec is n=\r\not limited by politness rules) the crawler \nis\n&gt; capable of (in my experian=\r\nce) going as high 21.1 Mbits/sec (over a \nperiod of\n&gt; 24 hours). Peak loads=\r\n can be higher, especially if you are \ndownloading a lot\n&gt; of larger files.=\r\n If many crawling text documents, bandwidth usage \ndrops,\n&gt; since each text=\r\n document is subjected to link extraction that \ntakes time.\n&gt; The throughpu=\r\nt in terms of documents per second for the 24 hour \nperiod cited\n&gt; above wa=\r\ns approx. 57 docs/sec. (about 5 million docs and 214GB of\n&gt; uncompressed da=\r\nta in 24 hours).\n&gt;  \n&gt; The hardware in question includes dual Xeon processo=\r\nrs and 2 gigs \nworth of\n&gt; memory (+ abundant disk storage). Heritrix likes =\r\nprocessor power \nin my\n&gt; experience, its performance is usually limited by =\r\nthis factor \nalthough\n&gt; additional memory can somewhat improve throughput f=\r\nor high end \nmachines.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. Yep, read the User Manual. It has a section=\r\n on installation \nand &quot;A quick\n&gt; guide to running your first crawl job&quot; whi=\r\nch should get you up and \nrunning\n&gt; in no time. \nhttp://crawler.archive.org=\r\n/articles/user_manual.html#tutorial\n&gt;  \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message=\r\n-----\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:archive-crawler@yah=\r\noogroups.com] On Behalf Of callforshadab\n&gt; Sent: 21. okt=F3ber 2005 11:02\n&gt;=\r\n To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [archive-crawler] can Anybo=\r\ndy tell me, Why should i Use\n&gt; HERITRIX....... ???\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi, \n&gt; \n&gt; I am p=\r\nlanning to work with Heritrix.
