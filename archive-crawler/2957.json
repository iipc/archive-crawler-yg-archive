So, I create jobs\nbased=\r\n on a recovery everyday, and as the domain Im crawling has been\nupdated on =\r\na daily basis, I always have something to crawl, even not\nintroducing new s=\r\needs to it.\n\n2)\nIm getting some -5000 status code during a crawl and, acord=\r\ning to the\nuser manual, this would only happen if scope was changed during =\r\na\ncrawl. I get -5000 only at documents that match a specific word on a\nURIR=\r\negExpFilter I&#39;ve created for an override. Also, these documents\nthat get -5=\r\n000 do not have parent URIs...aparently, the&#39;re somehow\nassembled in a scri=\r\npt(js). Are you aware of situations that might\ntrigger this error? \n\nThanks=\r\n,\n\nSam\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
