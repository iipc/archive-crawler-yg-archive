When the\n&gt; DNS was back (and after waiting much longer than the time specified in\n&gt; Preprocessor/ip-validity-duration-seconds), I extracted these URLs and\n&gt; reimported them into the job in the hope that Heritrix would recrawl them.\n&gt; But it didn&#39;t. All the URLs were immediately rejected with the same -6\n&gt; status, without any DNS request. There&#39;s no problem in doing DNS lookup\n&gt; for any other application (nslookup, curl, wget, ...) on the same machine.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any way to convince Heritrix to change the status of those URLs?\n&gt; I wouldn&#39;t like to restart the jobs completely as they are nearly at the\n&gt; end. Any help would be appreciated. We are still running Heritrix 1.14.4.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt;     Bert\n&gt; --\n&gt; Bibliothï¿½que nationale de France\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
