I&#39;d like to set\n&gt; up the same thing with Heritrix.  Would anyone know how to do this?\n\nYou could use WAR version of Heritrix and host it in tomcat.\n\nOr it looks like you could make Heritrix UI go via AJP (mod_jk or \nmod_jk2) by changing the Listener installed into Jetty.  Currently we \nuse SocketListener.  You could try changing \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/SimpleHttpServer.html#173 \nso that instead we use \nhttp://jetty.mortbay.org/javadoc/org/mortbay/http/ajp/AJP13Listener.html \n(See also http://www.mortbay.com/jetty/faq?s=700-Clustering&t=modjk.  \nYou&#39;ll need to translate the jetty xml config. to API calls).  I haven&#39;t \ntried it.\n\nOr try using the SocketListener constructor that takes host and port or \ninetaddress and set the address to be localhost: See \nhttp://jetty.mortbay.org/javadoc/org/mortbay/http/SocketListener.html \nand the above cited location in Heritrix code where we initialize the \nwebserver.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
