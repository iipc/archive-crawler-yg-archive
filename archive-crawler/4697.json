If so it returns true, otherwise\n&gt; it returns false.\n&gt; \n&gt; A filter could be used in several places in the crawler. Most\n&gt; notably is the use of filters in the Scope. Aside that, filters are\n&gt; also used in processors. Filters applied to processors always filter\n&gt; URIs out. That is to say that any URI matching a filter on a\n&gt; processor will effectively skip over that processor. This can be\n&gt; useful to disable (for instance) link extraction on documents coming\n&gt;  &gt;from a specific section of a given website.\n&gt; \n&gt; All Filters should subclass the Filter class. Creating a filter is\n&gt; just a matter of implementing the innerAccepts(Object) method.\n&gt; Because of the planned overhaul of the scopes and filters, we will\n&gt; not provide a extensive example of how to create a filter at this\n&gt; point. It should be pretty easy though to follow the directions in\n&gt; the javadoc. For your filter to show in the application interface,\n&gt; you&#39;ll need to edit src/conf/modules/Filter.options\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; I have writed a filter class,but i have not know how to apply it?\n&gt; somebody can tell me ? Thank you.\n\n\n"}}
