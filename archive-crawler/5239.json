Every thread contends to get the next URI from the frontier\nbut since there are not too many hosts in your crawl bucket, the\npoliteness settings do not let release the next URI unless certain\npoliteness threshold  time settings have elapsed. Usually , a single\nhost/domain crawl provides a much lower throughput than a multi-domain\ncrawl.\n\nSolution :  Broad Crawls\n\nHope this helps.\n\nAnmol\n\nOn Mon, May 26, 2008 at 7:59 AM, pilotboy_84 &lt;car.pilotboy@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hy everyone.\n&gt; At the beginning of a job, this have the maximum number of actives\n&gt; threads, but as it progresses this number begins to decline and\n&gt; becomes only one or two actives threads and the crawler becomes very slow.\n&gt; Why this happens if I have in the queue a large number of URIs for\n&gt; visiting?\n&gt; Anyone can help me, please.\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n\n-- \nCourage doesn&#39;t always roar.
