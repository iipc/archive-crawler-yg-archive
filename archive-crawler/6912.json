But you&#39;d probably only want to \ndo that if you had some other system auto-generating CXML per launch; \nmaking such a change in place might be forgotten if you sometimes want \nto build that same CXML without resuming from a checkpoint.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/15/10 10:55 AM, sriram_varahan1 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I figured out a way to do it.
