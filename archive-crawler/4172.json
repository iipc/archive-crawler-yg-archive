I have setup my crawl to be very restrictive so that it stays\n&gt; only on the paths I wish, but I do need it to visit other domains to\n&gt; just pull down images.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically I need to make sure the crawl remains very restrictive for\n&gt; gathering links to pursue, but open to pulling down images from those\n&gt; links that pass even if they are on other domains.\n&gt; \n&gt; How would I suggest doing this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
