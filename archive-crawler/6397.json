The crawl gets paused with a lot =\r\nof retired queues which don&#39;t get crawled. \n\nAs far as I understand retirem=\r\nent is a feature which has to do with the general crawl-policy when each do=\r\nmain/queue gets crawled. \n\nTo disable the budget-feature I already enable t=\r\nhe ZeroCostAssignmentPolicy and set &quot;hold-queues&quot; of the frontier to &quot;false=\r\n&quot;. I thought that this way no retirement happens. But so far, the retiremen=\r\nt still happens.\n\nDo you have any hints or ideas how I could disable this r=\r\netirement behaviour? Or how I could reactivate those retired queues? I&#39;d pr=\r\nefer the first variant so my crawls get crawled completeley. \n\nCheers,\nTino=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
