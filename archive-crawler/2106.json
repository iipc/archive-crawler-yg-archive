For example I started a crawl with 2407 seeds, and it \n&gt; initially grew as new pages were discovered, but after a few minutes \n&gt; it reported that I was on page 568 of 593... making it hard to get a \n&gt; sense of what the real % complete is\n\nIt&#39;s been this way for a while: URIs that were scheduled, but then\n&#39;disregarded&#39; don&#39;t count as either pending or completed.\n\nThe most notable cause of &#39;disregarded&#39; URIs is those that are\nprecluded by robots.txt rules -- they get scheduled, but are never\nattempted, and so should neither count as successful, failed, or\nstill-pending.\n\nIf you&#39;ve added other settings which can cause URIs to be\nignored after having been initially scheduled -- such as\nnarrowing the scope midcrawl, resulting in URIs that get\nruled out-of-scope on rechecking -- that will also cause\nURIs to be disregarded, and the total &#39;queued&#39; will decrease\nwithout the &#39;completed&#39; changing.\n\nThis area of the crawler needs improvement; the current\ntallies of &#39;percent done&#39; and &#39;estimated time remaining&#39;\ntake no account of the potential for more URIs to be\ndiscovered, and so are almost worse-than-useless.\n\nI think tracking the effective rates of discovery versus\ncompletion -- and the rates of change of each -- could\noffer more meaningful estimates, for both the whole crawl\nand individual queues. Some notes on possible approaches\nare on the crawler wiki [*] here:\n\n   http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CrawlAndQueueDynamics\n\nBut, implementing some of these ideas is not yet a priority\nfor any upcoming releases, so it would take someone interested\nin this area to contribute some code for the situation to\nimprove in the short term.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n[*] Reminder: the crawler wiki edit password is available on\nrequest to any Heritrix users/developers interested in\nadding/revising the content.
