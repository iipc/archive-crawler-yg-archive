The rule that goes later overrides the \nprevious one.\n\n&gt; When I add a big list of sites to REJECT , the URIs/sec seems to get \n&gt; little slower , since it seems that it tooks more time to compare all \n&gt; the regexp.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does changing the order of the rules can increase the speed ?\n\nI don&#39;t know the answer right now. I think that URI processing with \nregexps should not take that much time comparing to page downloading and \ndelaying between the requests.\n\n&gt; for example , adding this rule as a first rule ?\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;newObject name=&quot;rejectPath&quot;\n&gt;  &gt; class=&quot;org.archive.crawler.deciderules.NotMatchesRegExpDecideRule&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;string name=&quot;decision&quot;&gt;REJECT&lt;/string&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;string name=&quot;regexp&quot;&gt;.*www.citeulike.org.*&lt;/string&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/newObject&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; After around 9 hours , I got 150 correct document in the arc file , \n&gt; would that be faster some time later ?\n\nI hope so.\nAs far as I understand how it should go it first concentrates on \ndownloading user/tag pages and there&#39;re a lot of them. So actual \narticles don&#39;t get downloaded in the beginning. I hope as the crawl \nprocess advances more articles get downloaded.\n\n&gt; These are the default settings for the delay , any suggestion on how to \n&gt; change them , since I don&#39;t want to be blocked at a later point .\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;newObject name=&quot;frontier&quot; class=&quot;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;float name=&quot;delay-factor&quot;&gt;4.0&lt;/float&gt;\n&gt; &lt;integer name=&quot;max-delay-ms&quot;&gt;20000&lt;/integer&gt;\n&gt; &lt;integer name=&quot;min-delay-ms&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/integer&gt;\n&gt; &lt;integer name=&quot;respect-crawl-delay-up-to-secs&quot;&gt;300&lt;/integer&gt;\n&gt; &lt;integer name=&quot;max-retries&quot;&gt;30&lt;/integer&gt;\n&gt; &lt;long name=&quot;retry-delay-seconds&quot;&gt;900&lt;/long&gt;\n\nUnfortunately I don&#39;t know as I don&#39;t have experience.\n\nRegards,\nSergey\n\n"}}
