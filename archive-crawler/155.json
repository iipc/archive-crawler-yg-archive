But an\nembedded offscope image on that last frame is 4 transitive hops away,\nand thus would not be included if the parameter is set at 3.\n\nWe&#39;re still experimenting with this notion, and how useful it\nis to prevent wandering too far off scope (or down endless\ncrawler traps).\n\nmax-toe-threads:\n\nThe total number of Java Threads spawned to crawl URIs in parallel.\n\n&gt; I believe, that max-link-hops=10 should mean, that the crawler should only\n&gt; walk 10 steps away from a seed URL.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; In the Processor  element, what does the Next component signify? Is this\n&gt; the next Processor to be activated?\n\nYes. In general, the Processors each specify a single next\nProcessor, but it is possible that some future custom Processors\nmight specify different next steps based on URI analysis.\n(For example, &quot;next-if-error&quot; or &quot;next-if-feature-X-detected&quot;.)\n\n&gt; Finally, in the Frontier element:\n&gt; &lt;frontier\n&gt;      class=&quot;org.archive.crawler.basic.Frontier&quot;\n&gt;      delay-factor=&quot;0&quot;\n&gt;      minimum-delay=&quot;0&quot;\n&gt;      maximum=delay=&quot;1000&quot;\n&gt;     /&gt;\n&gt; what does the variables &#39;delay-factor&#39;, &#39;minimum-delay&#39;, and\n&gt; &#39;maximum-delay&#39; signify?\n\nThese are all global politeness mechanisms, controlling the\namount of time between the completion of one URI (as reported back\nto the frontier), and the frontier&#39;s release of the next URI\nfor that same host.\n\n&#39;minimum-delay&#39; is the smallest wait-time allowable, specified\nin milliseconds.\n\n&#39;delay-factor&#39; is a multiple of the previous URI&#39;s elapsed time\nto wait. So if it took 500ms to complete the last URI, and the\ndelay-factor is 2, the frontier will delay emitting the next URI\nfor the same host for 1000ms. (Unless the minimum-delay is higher\nthan 1000ms).\n\n&#39;maximum-delay&#39; is a ceiling on how much of a delay to use,\nspecified in milliseconds. Even if the last URI took 3 seconds,\nand the delay-factor is 2, suggesting a delay of 6 seconds,\nif the maximum-delay is 2000ms, that maximum will be used.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n\n"}}
