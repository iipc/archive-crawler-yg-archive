Many of the sites are &quot;complicated&quot;, whether it&#39;s some\njavascript, or calendar-based browser traps, or frames, etc.  Also,\nmost of them are large and rely heavily on dynamically generated\ncontent.\n\nI need to basically wind up with a directory of saved html (or\nsomething that can re-generate the html - e.g., arcs).  Is there\nanything that puts either crawler above the other?\n\nHow does Heritrix  do for javascript link extraction?  Can it handle\nsimple js via guessing like Nutch does?  Frames?\n\nThanks kindly for any responses -- i know this post is a little vague.\n Also, is there any reason that the Nutch team hasn&#39;t opted to use\nHeritrix for their crawler?  I know their end goal is a search engine\nwhile the Heritrix goal is archival - maybe that answers that\nquestion.\n\nJohn\n\n"}}
