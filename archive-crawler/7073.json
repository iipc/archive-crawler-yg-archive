And, some \nscopes will expand mid-crawl when new seeds are added (though if other \nURLs were already rejected by the narrower scope, they aren&#39;t \nreconsidered unless rediscovered).\n\n� the hops-count tests generally use the &#39;hopsPath&#39; string of \nsingle-character tokens which each describe one hop -- &#39;L&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, and so \non. So, part of an automated solution might involve programmatically \nclipping that path when you want to re-start the count when reaching a \nnew hostname.\n\nHope this helps with ideas. If you need other pointers, let me know \nwhich Heritrix version you&#39;re using and more specifics about how you \nwant the first URLs into new sites to be treated.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 3/14/11 5:24 AM, drazenko.celjak wrote:\n&gt; I generate seeds from domain names (mydomain.com -&gt;  http://www.mydomain.com/), set max-hops to 3 and add +http://(com,mydomain, to surt file.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to crawl all newly discovered hosts/subdomains, not just seeds, with depth 3.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I understood &quot;max-hops&quot; correctly - hops are calculated starting from seed.
