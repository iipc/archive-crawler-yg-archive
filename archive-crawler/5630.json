But first I need to be able to build the system.\n\nMaybe event=\r\nually I could switch to the new version, but the older\nversion seems better=\r\n filled out with conveniences, like a better\nweb-based administration syste=\r\nm, probably because the new one is\nstill under construction.\n\nThanks for an=\r\ny and all help.\n\n-- Steve\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
