We think that we will be testing\nHCC again after that.\n\nW=\r\ne have some problems with the wrapper, exactly with the method\ngetHostAddre=\r\nss (only when running two or more parallel jobs). At first\nwe though that w=\r\nas a Heritrix 1.6 problem (because of the static\ncontroller), but the same =\r\nhappens with 1.8. \n\nSo, we are going to make some more tests, and try to fi=\r\nnd the root of\nthe problem (maybe is the wrapper).\n\nBy the way, do you know=\r\n if someone have succesfully tested multiple\nHeritrix instances in the same=\r\n JVM, running two or more parallel jobs?\n\nThanks very much,\n\ntizo\n\n\n\n--- In=\r\n archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; tizo=\r\n_trico wrote:\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t it wrong?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll change it.
