The =\r\n&quot;write&quot; function is overrided to check the elapsed time since the creation =\r\nof the current Warc file and to return a &quot;ProcessResult.FINISH&quot; if the time=\r\n limit is reached. \n\nThis new &quot;write&quot; function is called during the warc pr=\r\nocess but only once : when the warc file is created. I don&#39;t understand how=\r\n work the write process and when the system check the size (in my case the =\r\nelapsed time) of the current warc writter.\n\nThanks\n\nRomain\n\n\n\n\n"}}
