I tried it. I didn&#39;t experiment too much to figure out\nthe exact semantics as implemented by common servers, but it doesn&#39;t\ndo what you would expect.\n\n&gt; And if I can also set accept-charset, accept-language to limit the \n&gt; crawls to specified resources.\n\nAccept-Charset and Accept-Language are hints to the server used for\ncontent negotiation. The reason to set them is to &#39;force&#39; the server\nto send content in your preferred language/encoding when it wants to\nchoose.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
