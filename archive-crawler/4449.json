We \nencourage expert Heritrix users curious about upcoming changes to review \nthis release and share their feedback.\n\nThis release is officially &quot;2.0.0-alpha&quot;, but specifically build ID \n&quot;heritrix-2.0.0-20070719.171117-4&quot; from our automatic build system.\n\nDetails on downloading and using this release are available in the \nwiki-hosted Release Notes...\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/2.0.0-alpha+Release+Notes\n\nThree notable differences in Heritrix 2 are:\n\n(1) A more rigorous separation of the Web UI from the &#39;crawl engine&#39;, \ngiving greater flexibility to control crawlers remotely.\n(2) A new settings system, easing module development and offering new \nopportunities for dynamic configuration construction.\n(3) A new mechanism for custom override settings for sets of related \nURIs, extending beyond Heritrix 1.x&#39;s domain-centric overrides.\n\nA brief tutorial for exercising the new features via the new Web UI is \nhosted at...\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Tutorial\n\nThis preview is NOT recommended for casual Heritrix users or any \nproduction crawls; there are still significant gaps in UI/usability, \nfunctionality, and our usual pre-release acceptance testing. Additional \nguidance for developers and crawl operators to convert their 1.x \nconfigurations to Heritrix 2 will be offered with a future release.\n\nQuestions, comments, bug reports, suggestions welcome both here and via \nthe Heritrix JIRA issue tracker:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n"}}
