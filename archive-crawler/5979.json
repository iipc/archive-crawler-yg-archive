The only way I fo=\r\nund to continue the build, was to open the job (https://localhost:8443/engi=\r\nne/job/selftest-job) on browser, log in by the password provided during the=\r\n creation of the job in the terminal, and unpause it. oh and this happens a=\r\nbout 10-15 times! =3D)\n\nGordon, not sure if that&#39;s done on purpose, but cou=\r\nld you try to fix that, please? :)\n\nThanks in advance :)\n\ncheers,\nIkrom (sa=\r\nplo.com) \n\n\n"}}
