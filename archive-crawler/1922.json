Extract data form ARC one by one per user\n&gt; request at Wayback machine and cache it? Or unpack the whole ARC to\n&gt; file directories for users access? Or other way?\n\nWayback Machine uses an index whose form is very much like the default \noutput from ARCReader. URL/Date queries are run against this index. When \ncomes time to display a record, the WM uses the index to find the ARC \nthe wanted content resides in and the offset into the ARC at which it is \nto start gunzipping.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
