We have strong reasons to believe that one of our files ha=\r\ns been corrupted on the disk (its size is only ~19 MB, and it is not possib=\r\nle to unzip it conventionally). \n\nNow we would like to &quot;extend&quot; the file to=\r\n a valid arc.gz file so that it is possible to view its contents through e.=\r\ng. wayback all the same (which is not possible at the moment). Is there a s=\r\ntandard way to do this? \n\nThanks in advance, \n\nEleonora\n\n\n"}}
