I wish to crawl the website\nhttp://www.example.com/ . I set the value of user-agent and its email\naddress.\n\nI created a new job and selected HostScope crawl as the crawl-order\nscope.  Despite this it seems to be crawling other websites like\nhttp://www.example2.com/ or subdomains like\nhttp://subdomain.example.com/ . All the remaining options were left to\ndefault as per the profile.\n\nAlso I don&#39;t want it to crawl images, videos etc. The images and\nvideos have the proper file extensions and we can limit their crawl by\nextension rather than mime-type. I tried to configure this but failed.\n\nI found using DecidingScope/ DecidingFilter quite confusing. Perhaps\nit was because I could not configure it properly. Same happened trying\nto use HostScope.\n\nCan you guide me to a tutorial of help me create the config file for\nthis kind of crawling scenario.\n\nQuestion 2) Checkpoint question:\nI pause a job, checkpoint it. Shutdown the heritrix server. To resume\nthe job (once I start heritrix again) I got to the new job via\nrecovery page. Now should I click the link titled &#39;recovery-log&#39; or\nthe link with the greatest checkpoint number for that job.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n"}}
