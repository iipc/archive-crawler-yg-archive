So getVia is returning a URL=\r\n that will not be\navailable in the future. It should be returning\n&quot;http://w=\r\nww.abc.com/pages.html&quot; which is the page that produced the\nfinal URL.\n\nIs t=\r\nhere a work around for this, because I can not figure out how to\nfind the o=\r\nriginal VIA link for redirected links.\n\n\n"}}
