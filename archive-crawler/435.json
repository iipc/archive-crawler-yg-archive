Gordon Mohr has advised us to post questions\nin this list since there is discussion going on for future ARC extension.\n\nIn the case of our work, the files (typically scholarly articles etc)\nwould not really be retrieved from the network in the sense that we\nthink the ARC specification assumes.  In our case, files are obtained\nthrough many different ways, including shipment via tapes, ftp of tars\nof thousands of files, ...  They are typcially not &#39;harvested&#39; as \nsingle files from the Web.  We are looking into storing such files,\nobtained in whichever way, into ARC files.  So, our files are very\nmuch &#39;local&#39; files that do not really have a network location.  \n\nAs a result, an essential difference in our kind of use is that what\nwe store is not protocol-related. The file we store has a URI (say a\nDOI), and it has a mime-type, immediately after the header we expect\nthe actual &#39;content&#39;. Thus we have following questions:\n\n1. In current ARC implementation, the mime-type in the header for a\nfile stored in the ARC file provides informatoin on what to expect\nimmediately _after_ that protocol-specific part. Indeed, text/html is\nthe mime-type of the actual &#39;content&#39;, and does not specify the\nmime-type of the protocol-specific information. However, to store\nlocal files, the mime-type really specify what immediately after the\nheader. We think there are subtle differences here.\n\n2. For a &#39;reader&#39; of the ARC file to understand that there will be no\nprotocol-related information following the file header, the &#39;reader&#39;\nwould have to keep a list of all URI schemes for which indeed no\nprotocol info will be provided -- such a &#39;reader&#39; will be probably\nvery hard to implement.\n\nSo, somehow it seems to us that in order to allow for the\nimplementation of ARC files in our use case (which could be a use case\nin many other archives that not related to Web crawling), an extension\nof ARC format might be required with such possilities: (1) some flags\n(probably one bit in &#39;reserved&#39; field?) to indicate whether or not a\n&#39;local&#39; or &#39;networked&#39; document is archived, or, (2) seperation\nbetween identifier and access protocol? for example, an archived file\nmay have an http address, but is indeed archived by ftp or local file\ncopy.\n\nI look forward to your feedback and guide on these issues.\n\nmany thanks,\n\nXiaoming Liu\ndigital library research & prototyping\nLos Alamos National Laboratory - Research Library\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n"}}
