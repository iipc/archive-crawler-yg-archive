If so, retries because \nof the below connection timeouts with the Heritrix increasing interval \nbetween retries may look like the crawler is hung.  Check the frontier \nreport.  \n\nIs there nothing in heritrix_out.log?  You could send the process a \nSIGQUIT signal -- $ kill -3 HERITRIX_PROCESS_ID -- and it&#39;ll send a \nthread dump to heritrix_out.log.  Study the output.  Wait a while.  \nRedo.

Although I got these alerts, I dont think the\n&gt; crawl terminated because of that.\n&gt; Because on re-running the crawl it again mysteriously stopped after a\n&gt; (long) time even though I&#39;m sure the crawl was not completed. It was\n&gt; only some 5% done. And this time there were no alerts.\n&gt; However I saw some errors in the local-errors.log of this sort\n&gt;\n&gt; 2006-06-01T04:42:01.909Z    -2          -\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas LL\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams no-type #032 - - -\n&gt; le:SocketTimeoutException@HTTP\n&gt; java.net.SocketTimeoutException: connect timed out: timeout set at\n&gt; 20000ms.\n&gt;       at\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.fetcher.HeritrixProtocolSocketFactory.createSocket(HeritrixProtocolSocketFactory.java:142)\n&gt;       at\n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpConnection.open(HttpConnection.java:707)\n&gt;       at\n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeWithRetry(HttpMethodDirector.java:382)\n&gt;       at\n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeMethod(HttpMethodDirector.java:168)\n&gt;       at\n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:396)\n&gt;       at\n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:324)\n&gt;       at \n&gt; org.archive.crawler.fetcher.FetchHTTP.innerProcess(FetchHTTP.java:408)\n&gt;       at \n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.Processor.process(Processor.java:103)\n&gt;       at\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.processCrawlUri(ToeThread.java:306)\n&gt;       at org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.run(ToeThread.java:153)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There were 2 errors like this.\n&gt; I doubt if this caused the crawl to end though. Since there were two\n&gt; of these and if it was really terminal the first one should have\n&gt; brought the crawl to an end.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; is there anyother condition for which the crawler gracefully gives up.\n&gt; Like if there are too many URLs in the frontier queue.\n&gt; I&#39;m assuming a heap overflow would have an explicit error message\n&gt; indicating that.\n&gt;\n&gt; (My estimated crawl job time was 4 days)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Jonathan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; jonathansiddharth wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;         This alert/exception abruptly terminated my crawl job.
