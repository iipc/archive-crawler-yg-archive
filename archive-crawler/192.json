I can see\n&gt; it is in early development, what can it do at the moment?

Sorry for the delay in responding.\n\nHeritrix currently takes a seed list, typically up to hundreds of sites,\nand then crawls according to a number of configurable parameters, including...\n\n  - within a limited number of hops\n  - within the seed domains, hosts, or path-prefixes\n\nThe configuration of the crawler is achieved via a number of pluggable\nJava implementation classes, so other forms of focusing the crawl, including\nforms based on content analysis, can be added by coding the appropriate\nnew classes.\n\nAs the internal interfaces continue to evolve and the documentation outside\nof source code is thin, Heritrix is still best suited for use by adventurous\nusers with Java development skills, especially those eager to contribute to\nthe core design with feedback or functionality.\n\nCan you tell us more about your project?\n\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to send any and all questions you have to the list;\nresponses will usually come much more quickly!\n\n- Gordon @ IArchive\n\n\n"}}
