So I would rather change my seed\n&gt; list to this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.site-a.ca\n&gt; http://www.site-b.ca\n&gt; \n&gt; BUT this now means I will now not get the subdomains like\n&gt; subdomain.site-a.ca.\n&gt; \n&gt; So to fix this I figure I need to change it to this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.site-a.ca\n&gt; http://www.site-b.ca\n&gt; +site-a.ca\n&gt; +site-b.ca\n&gt; \n&gt; This is pretty long winded especially with 1000s of seeds.  Is there a\n&gt; better solution?  Is it possible somehow to have seeds with www at the\n&gt; start but make it so the www is ignored when translating it to a SURT\n&gt; form (without having to change to an OnDomains decide rule) ?  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Adam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
