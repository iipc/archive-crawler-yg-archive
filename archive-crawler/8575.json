Can this be done with a decide rule or is there maybe \nalready a switch?\nI am using a seeds file with surts and I only want crawl these Urls and \nalso only want a DNS Lookup for the hosts in this scope.\n\nMy problem is that I have two domains with identical webserver setup on \nthe same machine. One has alot of external Links and one not.\nThe domain without many external Links can be crawled with about \n50Urls/sec and the other one just with 0.5Urls/sec\nThats why I think the DNS-Lookup of the outgoing links might cause the \nspeed issue.\n\nCheers,\nMarkus\n\n"}}
