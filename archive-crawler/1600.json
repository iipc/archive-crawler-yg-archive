This info. is used whenever an extractor goes to\n&gt; get a character stream. No attempt currently is made at using\n&gt; content-type info location such as the HTML META info.\n&gt;\n&gt; In heritrix, a heuristic tries to figure if the charset is single or\n&gt; multibyte. If multibyte we use an expensive charset decoding\n&gt; character stream that maps the charset to that of the JVMs.\n&gt; Otherwise we use the default treating each byte as a character. If\n&gt; the supplied charset is unknown, we fall back on treating the stream\n&gt; as single-byte.\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; But, when I take look at the source code, I found heritrix only try\n&gt; to identify the charset from HTTP head, which is done by function\n&gt; setCharacterEncoding(.,.) in FetchHTTP.java.\n&gt;\n&gt; am I right?\n\nYou are right. \n\nThat is what the doc. is trying to say.  The second paragraph could be \nbetter written.  Its trying to convey that if the heuristic judges the \ncharset multibyte -- by looking at the charset name -- then we use a \nCharSetDecoder instance to make sure the stream passed the encoders is \nproperly decoded (Decoding is whats expensive).  Otherwise, we treat \neach byte in the stream as a character.\n\n&gt; If so, I should plug in a charset recognizer.\n\nThat&#39;d be sweet.  Recent coarse analysis has the http headers and the \nhtml header content-type being pretty unreliable (See &#39;Observations&#39; on \nthis page: http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ArchivePassProject).\n\nIf you&#39;re thinking of adding a recognizer, here is the extant issue that \ncovers the topic: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102&func=detail&aid=899909.\n\nHere is another issue that talks of our adding extraction of charset \nfrom head of the html (there is even an untested patch to do it): \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102&func=detail&aid=913687  \nI&#39;m less enthusiastic about this patch after the findings cited above.  \nI&#39;m thinking language/encoding recognizer is more the way to go.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
