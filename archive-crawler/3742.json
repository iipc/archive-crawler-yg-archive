In the case of\n&gt;&gt; configuration-heavy extractors one may want two differently configured\n&gt;&gt; but same class extractors. Maybe Processor.options should key on the\n&gt;&gt; name instead of the class or something...\n&gt;  \n&gt; Agreed (I made an RFE with your suggestion here: \n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1642052&group_id=73833&atid=539102).\n&gt; St.Ack\n\nYes, this should be allowed -- indeed it was the intent of allowing \nprocessors to have an assigned name separate from their class, and if \nanything in the UI prevents that, it&#39;s a bug.\n\nI suspect the motivation here is to apply different configuration \nsettings to different target URLs (but still only apply one extractor to \neach URL). This should already be possible in most cases using a single \nExtractor with settings that are changed to new values for some URLs. \nThis can be currently be done using &#39;overrides&#39; (on a domain basis) or \n&#39;refinements&#39; (on a URL regex basis).\n\nThe upcoming settings overhaul should eventually make it easier to \noverride settings using arbitrary criteria. For example, an upstream \nprocessor could, as the result of any analysis of the URL pattern or \ncontent, apply a collection of changed settings to an URL, changing \nlater downstream URL processing.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
