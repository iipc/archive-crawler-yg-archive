I have the hs_err_pidXXX.logs and the\nheritrix_out.log, but n=\r\neither points me clearly toward the problem. \nI&#39;m running Heritrix-20050531=\r\n0807 (though I&#39;ve had crashes with\nprevious versions, including 1.4, as wel=\r\nl) on a dual Opteron, with 2G\nof ram, running Linux 2.6.9, glibc 2.3.4, JVM=\r\n 1.5.0_03.\n\nIs there some logging I could turn on (or perhaps somewhere I c=\r\nould\nlook) which could point me toward the right direction?  I&#39;m guessing\ni=\r\nt has to do with a certain URL getting hit, which causes the crash,\nso if I=\r\n could narrow down what exactly Heritrix is up to right before,\nmaybe I cou=\r\nld figure out how to skip the particular URL&#39;s.\n\nA little more information:=\r\n  In the past, the crashes have mostly been\nconsistent.  My previous usage =\r\nmodel was to break large seed files\ninto smaller chunks, and Heritrix would=\r\n usually crash consistently on\nthe chunks with problems.  Sometimes, re-run=\r\nning a seed chunk which\nwould cause a crash could run to competion without =\r\ncrashing (becase I\nretire host-based queues at 200 URL&#39;s, this could be due=\r\n to the bad\nURL being occasionally skipped for being out of scope), but mos=\r\nt of\nthe time the crash would be consistent.  I&#39;m now continually loading\ns=\r\needs via cmdline-jmx.  I&#39;ve changed my program to output exactly at\nwhat po=\r\nint the crash happens (when the connection is refused), but\nthat won&#39;t real=\r\nly make clear exactly which URL&#39;s are being crawled at\nthe time.\n\nAre there=\r\n known bugs that would cause hard crashes I could look into? \nWould posting=\r\n the log files to this list help debug the problem?  Is\nthere logging I cou=\r\nld turn on to show exactly what was being crawled\nat the time of the crash?=\r\n  Any other ideas of approaches to take\ntoward solving the problem?\n\nThanks=\r\n.\n\n-matt\n\n"}}
