My preference would be to add the data as \nyou&#39;ve done as explicit data members rather than with anonymous \nputs/gets into AList (We should do some refactoring so its easier \nplugging in different CrawlURI implementations).  Needs to be clean \ndivision between data that is only to persist across an individual \nCrawlURI processing and data that is to live for the life of the \nCrawlURI (Kris has been talking up this fact with a while now).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) if they are in the Alist, should there be centrally defined \n&gt; setter&#39;s and\n&gt; getter&#39;s or should the code just do what needs to be done every time to\n&gt; access them?\n\nNot sure what you mean here Dave.  Please expound further.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) once upon a time the date variable was the string returned by the\n&gt; server.  then it became a Date object. Now its milliseconds because every\n&gt; time I needed it, I needed the millisecond value.  Is there a \n&gt; preference to\n&gt; what format things like this *should* be kept in?\n\nNone.  Whatever is most amenable.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) I&#39;m keeping the content-length separate from the *other* content \n&gt; length\n&gt; value.  I&#39;m not sure this is required.  By the time there could be a\n&gt; conflict the real value should be known.  Can anyone think of a reason to\n&gt; keep them separate?  Right now, my preference would be to use the \n&gt; existing\n&gt; variable.\n\nThe http-header content-length will often disagree with what Heritrix \ncalculates as content-length so keeping them separate makes sense.  The \nhttp-header content-length may not always be present, nor is it \nguaranteed to be correct.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 6) I have no ego attached to the variable names.  If someone thinks\n&gt; something else would be better, I&#39;ll make the changes.\n&gt;\nJust a suggestion: I&#39;d add httpHeader prefix to those fields you&#39;ve \ngotten from http-headers to help better distingush them.\n\nGood stuff Dave,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave Skinner   dave at solid dot net\n&gt;     High Performance Programming---assembly (lots of them), C, java, perl\n&gt;     Database and Non-trivial web site implementations\n&gt;     Real-time and embedded systems are my specialty\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
