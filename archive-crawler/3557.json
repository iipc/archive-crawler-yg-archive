How=\r\never, \nmy company uses proxy authentication (NTLM scheme) so I got connecti=\r\non \nrefused problem.\n\nI&#39;ve attempted to add the following: Put the proxy IP=\r\n address, port, \nnetwork user name and password in the order.xml file. Thes=\r\ne are then \nread by the FetchHTTP processor. In the innerProcess() method o=\r\nf this \nprocessor, I do the following:\n\nNTCredentials ntCredentials =3D new=\r\n NTCredentials(login, pwd, \nmyComputerName, domain);\n//where login and pwd =\r\nare my network login and pwd taken from order.xml\n//myComputerName and doma=\r\nin are obtained from My Computer&#39;s \nProperties. I&#39;ve tried both short name =\r\nfor the computername and \nfullname (including the domain)\n\nAuthScope authsc=\r\nope =3D new AuthScope( host, Integer.parseInt(port), \nnull, &quot;ntlm&quot;);\n//is n=\r\null correct for realm here? I also tried to use domain instead \nof null but=\r\n no luck\n//where host and port are taken from order.xml\n//then set proxy cr=\r\nedentials\nthis.http.getState().setProxyCredentials( authscope, ntCredential=\r\ns);  \n\nI then setDoAuthentication() to true.\n\nWhen running the application,=\r\n I receive the following error:\nFailure authenticating with NTLM &lt;any realm=\r\n&gt;@....x.x:xxxx\nNov 23, 2006 5:37:30 PM org.archive.crawler.fetcher.Fetc=\r\nhHTTP \ninnerProcess\nINFO: GET http://www.abc.edu/ 407 4515 text/html\n\n-----=\r\n---\nThe &quot;407&quot; status code means proxy authentication required.
