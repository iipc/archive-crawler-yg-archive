Right now I am trying \nto us=\r\ne heredrix to help me collect web pages to build a web graph. I \nam current=\r\nly using the newest version of heredrix (versoin 1.1.2 I \nbelieve). I see t=\r\nhat this version filters out any duplicated pages; \nany duplicated pages en=\r\ncounter is not recorded in the log.\n\nHowever, in order to construct a prope=\r\nr webgraph, I need the \ncrawler, when it encounter a duplicated page, to re=\r\ncord this page to \nthe log, while not allowing to give birth to children. B=\r\necause any \nduplicate pages encountered indicates a linkback or a link to \n=\r\nprevious encountered pages, I am intrested in these relationship and \ndo no=\r\nt wish these links to be terminated\n\nThat is, any duplicated pages encounte=\r\nred during crawling, I need \nthem to be recorded in the log, including thei=\r\nr father url, but I \ndon&#39;t want any duplicated pages to have further childr=\r\nen. \n\nI&#39;ve tried playing around with the setting for herdrix 1.1.2 but I&#39;m =\r\n\ngetting nowhere; I&#39;ve read that older version of heredrix does not \nhave t=\r\nhe ability to filter out duplicate pages, so perhaps I should \ntry older ve=\r\nrsions of heredrix?\n\nany help would be appriciated\n\nthanks\n\n\n\n\n"}}
