(this was noted in a test crawl, and th=\r\ne fact that the urls are not retried) \n\nFor the moment we have &quot;bodged it&quot; =\r\nso in this case the script just sleep(30), which causes Heritrix to timeout=\r\n and retry the url later ;)\n\nFrom reading the source code it appears no spe=\r\ncial handling of error codes is done. For errors in the 5xx range would at =\r\nleast expect them to be retried in the same way that connection failures an=\r\nd connection lost are? \n\nThanks. \n\n\n\n"}}
