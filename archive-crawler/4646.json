So, if you have a seed that has \nnon-resolvable dns, it will take about 19 hours (30*15minutes) before \ncrawler gives up on the dns fetch and moves on. This might explain the \nidle state that you are seeing.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; In 1.12.1 I have a single url in a seed list which is not a resolvable domain name.  Just to \n&gt; clarify, this is not a seed list with a collection of urls with one that can&#39;t be resolved, but a \n&gt; seed list containing only one domain. The crawl log shows a 0 for the lookup of the domain, \n&gt; but the crawl does not end.  It just sits there and does fail or end.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, is this a known bug?  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Briggs.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
