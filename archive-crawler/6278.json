Seems like a bug to me.  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I work around this problem using the following property setting under the MirrorWriterProcessor bean:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;path&quot; value=&quot;jobs/your_job_name/mirror&quot;/&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That means I have to customize it for every job, but it&#39;s not that much hassle.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Steve\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 01/07/2010 at 9:18 AM, anas elghafari wrote:\n&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am not quite sure I understood what you mean, if you mean to ask where\n&gt;&gt;&gt; the files resulting from MirrorWriter are located, they are located in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; $HERITRIX_HOME/jobs/your_job_name/mirror.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jan 7, 2010 at 1:32 PM, sriram_varahan1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;sriram_varahan1@... &lt;mailto:sriram_varahan1@...&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \tIs there any log where the path where files are mirrored to is logged?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \tI have checked out the basic logs but could not find the mirror\n&gt;&gt;&gt; path being logged into.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \tAny help would be appreciated.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \tRegards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \tSriram Varahan.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
