Here is the original announcement: \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1905.\n\nRegards 2. in the below, do you want your additions to Heritrix to \ninclude web UI?  Currently, the Heritrix UI Is not (easily) extensible \nbut it wouldn&#39;t be difficult making it so you could pass a list of \nwebapps, and the context on which to deploy the webapps, to the Heritrix \nembedded Jetty webserver instance.  For example, if you bundled your \nclassifier UI up as the classifier.war file, you might browse to \nhttp://localhost:8080/admin to get the Heritrix admin pages and to \nhttp://localhost:8080/classifier to obtain your classifier UI.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\nsundaram subramanian wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My understanding is that you want to analyse the fetched pages and \n&gt; extract links based on that. I think you should write a new Extractor \n&gt; which calls your analyzer and extracts links based on it\n&gt;\n&gt; */ahmed ghouzia &lt;ghouzia@...&gt;/* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Dear Heritrix friends,\n&gt;\n&gt;     I am a researcher using heritrix to build a focused crawler  in my\n&gt;     experimental work.\n&gt;      I have a new crawling strategy which determines which pages to\n&gt;     retrieve next so that it keeps your crawler focused on a psecific\n&gt;     topic,\n&gt;\n&gt;     This strategy depends on examining the ststus of some features in\n&gt;     the retrieved page, depending on this estimation , it would be\n&gt;     determined which URL to get next.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I am asking the following:\n&gt;\n&gt;     1-Where to put this crawling strategy? As a frontier,  or a filter\n&gt;     2- I want to display the results in a web page , like that\n&gt;     displayed by search engines.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I would appreciate your help very much.\n&gt;\n&gt;     A.M.
