This setting results in GC getting called very la=\r\ntely but when called, it takes about a minute to complete. This is the reas=\r\non behind the previous test results showing very less throughput above 100 =\r\nsimulataneous connections. After removing it, we see the following throughp=\r\nut.\n\n100 connections - about 4.0 Mbytes/sec ( This is same as the reading w=\r\ne got before )\n250 connections - about 2.7 Mbytes/sec ( This was less than =\r\n1 Mbytes/sec before )\n500 connections - about 1.8 Mbytes/sec ( This was les=\r\ns than 1 Mbytes/sec before )\n\nwhich means that the throughput indeed degrad=\r\nes with the number of connections; but not as bad as before.\n\nWe also ran a=\r\nnother quick test wherein we used NBIO instead of the java NIO. We noticed =\r\nthat the throughput degraded to 1.8 Mbytes/sec in the 100 connections case.=\r\n This makes things even more fishy.\n\nThe differences between our setup and =\r\nthe setup used by the SEDA benchmarks are\n\nCrawler Setup                   =\r\n -- SEDA benchmark Setup\n\n- Sun JDK 1.4.1                 -- IBM JDK 1.1.8\n=\r\n- JDK 1.4 NIO library          -- NBIO library\n- 100 Mbps Ethernet         =\r\n -- Gigabit Ethernet\n- No Cache on Webserver  -- Must have had caching.\n \nT=\r\nhe other test combinations we are running now over our SEDA Http downloader=\r\n are\n- Try java -server option.\n- Try JDK 1.4.2 beta.\n- Try IBM JDK 1.4\n- T=\r\nry IBM JDK 1.1.8 with NBIO - This is the closest comparison that we can do =\r\nagainst SEDA benchmarks.\n- Do tests enabling the web server cache.\n\n\nThanks=\r\n,\nReddy\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Gordon Mohr \n  To: archive=\r\n-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, April 15, 2003 12:33 AM\n  Subjec=\r\nt: Re: [archive-crawler] SEDA Performance !!\n\n\n  Thanks for the updated ana=\r\nlysis!\n\n  However, I am concerned that the results may be more a result of =\r\nthe\n  test design or the specific HTTP implementation we&#39;re using than the\n=\r\n  underlying NIO/aSocket code, because the results diverge so greatly\n  fro=\r\nm SEDA&#39;s own published performance testing.\n\n  For example, the results at.=\r\n..\n\n    http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/sandstorm/iocore-bench/index.h=\r\ntml\n\n  ...show strong throughput up through 1,000 simultaneous connections,=\r\n\n  indeed even up past 10,000 simultaneous connections.\n\n  Also, given the =\r\nnote about the 1.4.1 -&gt; 1.4.2 JRE NIO change, a test\n  under 1.4.2 is neces=\r\nsary to truly evaluate either of the asynchronous\n  options.\n\n  Some other =\r\nquestions about the test setup:\n\n  - the meaning of &quot;maxConnections&quot; is unc=\r\nlear to me; it seems it\n     is not a &quot;maximum&quot; but a &quot;target&quot;, and the act=\r\nual number of\n     connections at any point in time might be larger or smal=\r\nler.\n     Is this right?\n\n  - do you have any other intrumentation which su=\r\nggests it is\n     specifically garbage collection which is causing the degr=\r\nadation\n     of the SEDA approach above 100 connections?\n\n  - if some of th=\r\ne setups are hitting garbage-collection or other\n     resource thresholds, =\r\nmore info about the test machine/VM would\n     be helpful: RAM, VM options =\r\nused (server hotspot? heap/stack\n     sizes? etc.)\n\n  - with only 2 Apache =\r\nweb servers to one client process, we may\n     be testing/hitting Apache pe=\r\nrformance limits as much as Java/IO\n     limits. For example, default Apach=\r\ne will only accept 150 simultaneous\n     clients; by my reading of the test=\r\n setup this means that no\n     matter how many connections the LAN test att=\r\nempted, it would\n     never succeed on more than 300 (across the two test A=\r\npaches)\n     at once -- so any LAN test numbers over 300 aren&#39;t really\n    =\r\n indicative of Java performance.\n\n  - is the test code something you could =\r\ncheck into CVS?\n\n  These figures are all very interesting, and even if quir=\r\nks in\n  the test are pushing results one way or the other, that will\n  usua=\r\nlly generate useful info, too.\n\n  - Gordon\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n=\r\n  From: G.B.Reddy\n  To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Friday, Apr=\r\nil 11, 2003 3:16 PM\n  Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] SEDA Performance !!\n\n\n=\r\n  Gordon,\n\n  Please find attached the performance report on the SEDA aSocke=\r\nt NIO layer.

But the oceanstore &quot;HttpClient&quot; stage is\n =\r\n internally using it to do sequencing which is unnecessary since anyway the=\r\n &quot;HttpClient&quot; class implements\n  SingleThreadedEventHandlerIF. I have remov=\r\ned these overheads to do my performance testing.\n\n  After starting to test =\r\nthe SEDA socket performance, I ran into three problems in the SEDA&#39;s socket=\r\n framework.\n\n  - Newly discovered bug : The seda internals throw Concurrent=\r\nModification exceptions when iterating through the selector&#39;s registered\n  =\r\nkeys. This exceptions is highly reproducible when more number of concurrent=\r\n downloads happen. Synchronization has not been taken\n  care when the ReadE=\r\nventHandler tries to deregister the socket from the selector of the WriteEv=\r\nentHandler. ( As you would know, there\n  are three stages ReadStage, WriteS=\r\ntage and ListenStage in the seda socket framework. Each has its own java Se=\r\nlector instance and\n  they wait on its select call. The ReadStage is the on=\r\ne that determines that a connection is terminated. When this happens, it\n  =\r\ndirectly tries to make a deregister call on the WriteStage&#39;s selector on th=\r\nis socket object. So, easily concurrent mod exceptions\n  are thrown when my=\r\n downloader stage is pumping requests and making new connections). I shall =\r\nraise this bug to the author and I am\n  proceeding with my fix on it. Becau=\r\nse of this unsynchronized communication, a lot of CancelledKeyExceptions ar=\r\ne also thrown in the\n  internals.\n\n  - A documented bug : ConcurrentModific=\r\nation exceptions when iterating through the selector&#39;s selectedKeys. This i=\r\ns also due to no\n  synchronization. Multiple threads are allowed by the sed=\r\na internals to do select calls on a single selector. (Look for the docs in\n=\r\n  seda.sandStorm.lib.aSocket.nio.NIOSelectSource.doPoll method). I will hav=\r\ne to look for doing some minimal synchronization as stated\n  in there.\n\n  -=\r\n There has been other rare NullPointerExceptions and IllegalArgumentExcepti=\r\non in some places. I will have to look into their\n  implications.\n\n  I will=\r\n fix the last two problems and get the performance measurements tomorrow.\n\n=\r\n  Thanks,\n  Reddy\n\n  ----- Original Message -----\n  From: Gordon Mohr\n  To:=\r\n archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n  Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2003 12:17 AM=\r\n\n  Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] Status !!\n\n\n  Thanks for the update!\n\n  T=\r\nhe Ocenstore libhttp package is known to be very rough; really just a\n  pla=\r\nceholder or starting point for what we&#39;d need.

The same tests that we did for the downloader will be repeated=\r\n in this oceanstore setup. We\n  are removing some oceanstore code to make i=\r\nt similar.

is unclear to \n  me; it seems it&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not a=\r\n &quot;maximum&quot; but a &quot;target&quot;, and the \n  actual number of&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; conn=\r\nections at any point in time might be \n  larger or smaller.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n Is this right?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- do you have any \n  other intrumentation which sugg=\r\nests it is&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; specifically garbage \n  collection which is caus=\r\ning the degradation&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the SEDA \n  approach above 100 conne=\r\nctions?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- if some of the setups are hitting \n  garbage-collection or=\r\n other&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; resource thresholds, more info \n  about the test mac=\r\nhine/VM would&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; be helpful: RAM, VM options \n  used (server h=\r\notspot? heap/stack&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; sizes? etc.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- with \n  only 2 Apa=\r\nche web servers to one client process, we may&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; be \n  testing=\r\n/hitting Apache performance limits as much as Java/IO&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  li=\r\nmits. For example, default Apache will only accept 150 \n  simultaneous&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; clients; by my reading of the test setup this \n  means that no&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter how many connections the LAN test \n  attempted, it w=\r\nould&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; never succeed on more than 300 (across the \n  two test=\r\n Apaches)&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; at once -- so any LAN test numbers over 300 \n  ar=\r\nen&#39;t really&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; indicative of Java performance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- is the=\r\n \n  test code something you could check into CVS?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These figures are =\r\nall \n  very interesting, and even if quirks in&lt;BR&gt;the test are pushing resu=\r\nlts one \n  way or the other, that will&lt;BR&gt;usually generate useful info, too=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- \n  Gordon&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message -----&lt;BR&gt;From: G.B.Reddy=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;To: \n  archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Friday, April 11, 2003 =\r\n3:16 \n  PM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] SEDA Performance \n  !!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Gordon,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please find attached the performance report on \n  the SE=\r\nDA aSocket NIO layer.

I h=\r\nave \n  removed these overheads to do my performance testing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After s=\r\ntarting to \n  test the SEDA socket performance, I ran into three problems i=\r\nn the SEDA&#39;s \n  socket framework.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- Newly discovered bug : The seda =\r\ninternals throw \n  ConcurrentModification exceptions when iterating through=\r\n the selector&#39;s \n  registered&lt;BR&gt;keys. This exceptions is highly reproducib=\r\nle when more number of \n  concurrent downloads happen. Synchronization has =\r\nnot been taken&lt;BR&gt;care when \n  the ReadEventHandler tries to deregister the=\r\n socket from the selector of the \n  WriteEventHandler. ( As you would know,=\r\n there&lt;BR&gt;are three stages ReadStage, \n  WriteStage and ListenStage in the =\r\nseda socket framework. Each has its own java \n  Selector instance and&lt;BR&gt;th=\r\ney wait on its select call. The ReadStage is the \n  one that determines tha=\r\nt a connection is terminated. When this happens, \n  it&lt;BR&gt;directly tries to=\r\n make a deregister call on the WriteStage&#39;s selector on \n  this socket obje=\r\nct. So, easily concurrent mod exceptions&lt;BR&gt;are thrown when my \n  downloade=\r\nr stage is pumping requests and making new connections). I shall \n  raise t=\r\nhis bug to the author and I am&lt;BR&gt;proceeding with my fix on it. Because \n  =\r\nof this unsynchronized communication, a lot of CancelledKeyExceptions are a=\r\nlso \n  thrown in the&lt;BR&gt;internals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- A documented bug : ConcurrentMo=\r\ndification \n  exceptions when iterating through the selector&#39;s selectedKeys=\r\n. This is also \n  due to no&lt;BR&gt;synchronization. Multiple threads are allowe=\r\nd by the seda \n  internals to do select calls on a single selector. (Look f=\r\nor the docs \n  in&lt;BR&gt;seda.sandStorm.lib.aSocket.nio.NIOSelectSource.doPoll =\r\nmethod). I will \n  have to look for doing some minimal synchronization as s=\r\ntated&lt;BR&gt;in \n  there.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;- There has been other rare NullPointerExcepti=\r\nons and \n  IllegalArgumentException in some places. I will have to look int=\r\no \n  their&lt;BR&gt;implications.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will fix the last two problems and get=\r\n the \n  performance measurements tomorrow.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;Reddy&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-=\r\n---- \n  Original Message -----&lt;BR&gt;From: Gordon Mohr&lt;BR&gt;To: \n  archive-crawl=\r\ner@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Wednesday, April 09, 2003 12:17 \n  AM&lt;BR&gt;Subjec=\r\nt: Re: [archive-crawler] Status !!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks for the \n  update!&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;The Ocenstore libhttp package is known to be very rough; really \n  just=\r\n a&lt;BR&gt;placeholder or starting point for what we&#39;d need.
