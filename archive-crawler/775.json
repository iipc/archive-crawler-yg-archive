Even though you&#39;ve started with 20-something sites, if\n&gt; many of them are small, they&#39;ll finish early and then you&#39;ll only\n&gt; be left with a handful of sites with pending resources. If the sites\n&gt; are then slow, or you are being very polite, you might only be visiting\n&gt; a site (or less) per second.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the crawler seems slow, use Reports-&gt;Frontier Report to see how\n&gt; many per-host work queues are active. I would never expect the progress\n&gt; to be more than (# active queues)/(minimum delay seconds).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Maybe I have my politeness settings too polite and it&#39;s slowing me\n&gt; &gt; down too much.  What are your recommended settings?\n&gt; \n&gt; The defaults are a good start. We go even more polite if we can.\n&gt; If you&#39;re confident the sites are able to handle the traffic you can\n&gt; edge down the retry-delay multiple,min-delay and max-delay settings...\n&gt; but patience is a virtue if you don&#39;t want to anger (and sometimes\n&gt; get IP-blocked by) crawled sites.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Rob.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@a...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Because of the crawler&#39;s adjustable politeness settings, with\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; respect to any\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;one given remote server, it will typically spend more time waiting\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; between\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;fetches than it does in fetches/processing.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Thus even if there are 50 target sites, no more than a few threads\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; may ever\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;be necessary at once, because 90%+ of the target sites are in\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; politeness-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;waiting at all times.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;- Gordon @ IA\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;robeger wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got a crawl running with 21 seed URIs, and the max toe\nthreads is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;set to 50.
