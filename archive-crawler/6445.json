Since html won&#39;t be crawled, css referred to i=\r\nn the uncrawled html will not be discovered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; DEEPA R wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; Hi, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am trying to narrow my crawl by allowing only css ty=\r\npes of files to be accepted. For this I am using the &quot;NotMatchesFilePattern=\r\nDecideRule&quot; with the properties like :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &lt;bean class=3D&quot;org.archiv=\r\ne.modules.deciderules.NotMatchesFilePatternDecideRule&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;property=\r\n name=3D&quot;decision&quot; value=3D&quot;REJECT&quot; /&gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;property name=3D&quot;regex&quot; v=\r\nalue=3D&quot;.*(/|&#92;.css)$&quot; /&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; with the other rules in thi=\r\ns order , as on the manual :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    1. RejectDecideRule\n&gt; &gt;    2. Surt=\r\nPrefixedDecideRule\n&gt; &gt;    3. TooManyHopsDecideRule\n&gt; &gt;    4. PathologicalPa=\r\nthDecideRule\n&gt; &gt;    5. TooManyPathSegmentsDecideRule\n&gt; &gt;    6. NotMatchesFi=\r\nlePatternDecideRule\n&gt; &gt;    7. PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But I a=\r\nm getting all types of files like pdf , images and not getting the css file=\r\ns . I am not able to figure out where am I going wrong. Any help is greatly=\r\n appreciated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
