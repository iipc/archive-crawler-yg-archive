I use it with both path \ncrawls and some specialized broad crawls. Iit is a major thing that is \ncontributing to me not running out of memory (it also seems to speed up \nfrontier because large numbers of URL never get to the scheduler).   I&#39;d be \nhappy to share the code but at this point my entire filter model is \nnon-standard and I&#39;ve not got a clue about how much or little it might have \nin common with the new filter model.\n\nUnless you need it yesterday, it would probably be best to wait until the \nnew filter model is released.\n\nAt 06:09 PM 3/23/2005, you wrote:\n\n&gt;gsellek wrote:\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve added the content type regex filters to my midfetch and ARC\n&gt; &gt; writers, which seems to be working.  But, non text is still getting\n&gt; &gt; added to my frontier, which means I crawl (and then abort) a lot of\n&gt; &gt; things I don&#39;t need.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, I was going to add a postselector regex filter to only add text\n&gt; &gt; back into the frontier to crawl.  But, the filters have me confused,\n&gt; &gt; and it does not seem to be behaving as I would expect.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have the following settings:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; filters ? Filters applied to this processor\n&gt; &gt;         URI ? URI regexp filter.\n&gt; &gt;           enabled:  ?    True\n&gt; &gt;           if-match-return:  ?  True\n&gt; &gt;           regexp:  ? .*\n&gt; &gt; (&#92;.gif|&#92;.jpeg|&#92;.jpg|&#92;.mov|&#92;.bmp|&#92;.pic|&#92;.png|&#92;.tiff|&#92;.tif|&#92;.css|&#92;.js|&#92;\n&gt; &gt; .swf|&#92;.qt|&#92;.mpeg|&#92;.mpg|&#92;.mp3|&#92;.avi|&#92;.wav|&#92;.wmv|&#92;.pdf|&#92;.doc|&#92;.xls|&#92;.cs\n&gt; &gt; v|&#92;.ppt)$\n&gt; &gt;       seed-redirects-new-seed:  ?  True\n&gt; &gt;       override-logger:  ?    True\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The thought being if it matches the regex then don&#39;t add it into the\n&gt; &gt; frontier.  If I set the if-match-return to True, nothing seems to\n&gt; &gt; get added to it.  But, if I set it to false, a lot of .gif\n&gt; &gt; and .jpegs are getting in.  I guess I just don&#39;t understand this\n&gt; &gt; whole filter thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;A filter on postselector is not going to do what you want.  The filter\n&gt;is run after the thing you are trying to exclude has already been\n&gt;fetched: i.e. the URL has gone down through the processor chain and its\n&gt;coming into postselector so postselector can mark the URI finished and\n&gt;so that any links found by extractors get unloaded and scheduled with\n&gt;the Frontier.\n&gt;\n&gt;You&#39;re trying to put a filter on scheduling.  The way to do this is by\n&gt;adding your filter to the scope.   The scheduler checks every found link\n&gt;against scope before scheduling.\n&gt;\n&gt;Try the FilterScope.  It allows you to add things like a regex that will\n&gt;include or exclude URIs before they&#39;re scheduled.\n&gt;\n&gt;St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any ideas?  (In general, I&#39;d rather use a regex to filter out things\n&gt; &gt; as above rather than in, but that could be done if necessary)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Greg\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *Yahoo!
