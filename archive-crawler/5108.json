My first question is this:\n\nHow can =\r\nI (using heritrix) request the webpage, parse out the\nchallenge form, then =\r\nPOST to a resource the unique string? (similar to\nwhat was brought up in th=\r\nis thread:\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2780)=\r\n?\n\nSecondly, I am getting the following error when attempting to do a\nstati=\r\nc post:\n\n&lt;map name=3D&quot;credentials&quot;&gt;\n&lt;newObject name=3D&quot;oo&quot;\nclass=3D&quot;org.arc=\r\nhive.crawler.datamodel.credential.HtmlFormCredential&quot;&gt;\n&lt;string name=3D&quot;cred=\r\nential-domain&quot;&gt;www.backtothefuture.com&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;string\nname=3D&quot;login-uri&quot;&gt;=\r\nhttps://www.backtothefuture.com/login.php&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;string name=3D&quot;http-met=\r\nhod&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;map name=3D&quot;form-items&quot;&gt;\n&lt;string name=3D&quot;challenge&quot;&gt;sta=\r\ntic&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;string name=3D&quot;md5pass&quot;&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;string name=3D&quot;noerror&quot;&gt;1=\r\n&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;string name=3D&quot;email&quot;&gt;buffordtannen@...&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;string n=\r\name=3D&quot;pass&quot;&gt;&quot;XXXX&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;/map&gt;\n\n\nerrors are on each post item:\n\n  \t\n\nSe=\r\ntting attribute value null on\n/crawl-order/credential-store/credentials/oo/=\r\nform-items/challenge:\nValue of illegal type: &#39;null&#39;, &#39;java.lang.String&#39; was=\r\n expected.\n\nSetting attribute value null on\n/crawl-order/credential-store/c=\r\nredentials/oo/form-items/email: Value\nof illegal type: &#39;null&#39;, &#39;java.lang.S=\r\ntring&#39; was expected.\n\n\nSetting attribute value null on\n/crawl-order/credent=\r\nial-store/credentials/oo/form-items/noerror: Value\nof illegal type: &#39;null&#39;,=\r\n &#39;java.lang.String&#39; was expected.\n\n....\n\n\nLastly, we pointed heritrix at ou=\r\nr proxy server, with the goal of\nintercepting HTTP headers for examination,=\r\n but it doesn&#39;t seem to send\nrequests through the configured proxy address/=\r\nport.\n\n\nthanks for all your help on these issues!\n-Bif\n\n\n"}}
