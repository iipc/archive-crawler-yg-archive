This is how\nwe use it:\n- we store the schedules in a database and provide a management front-end to it\n(if you only had a few schedules you can store them directly in code\nor in flat files).\nThe schedules vary from first and third Monday of the month, to\nparticular days of the year.\n- when a job comes time to be crawled its job execution is to build a\ncrawl configuration\nand then heritrix hcc (http://crawler.archive.org/hcc/) picks it up\nand assigns it to a crawler.\n\nAndrea\n\nOn Dec 9, 2007 7:39 PM, myepoch2008 &lt;liu_xingjian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My mean.How do realize the time in appointment grabbing Web page?\n&gt;  for example:No. 1&#39;s 23 o&#39;clock of every month.\n&gt;  thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I am not sure what do you mean.
