I have a ContentTypeRegExpFilter on the ARC writer\nlimiting the types saved to text/html. Indeed, this same order is\nbeing used in another Heritrix instance (a clone of this) without any\nproblems.\n\nHowever, when I look on disk, the ARC file contains only 7\nrecords. The other 21K or so are disappearing into the ether: the logs\nshow nothing out of the ordinary, the information is just getting lost\nsomewhere.\n\nAs I said, I have a clone of this running on another port and it is\nhappily saving tens of thousands of documents into the ARC files. This\nis weird.\n\nI&#39;m going to try some things on my side, but I wanted to ping the list\nand see if anyone has any ideas.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
