Not as such, although there was an issue with Heritrix builds \n&gt; failing on 2.6 kernels at some point. Myself, I&#39;m running on Red Hat, \n&gt; but that is simply because thats what we use here, not because \n&gt; Heritrix runs better on it. (Michael, I think there should be a FAQ \n&gt; entry for this question).\n\nWhat would you suggest Kris?  We have this FAQ entry -- \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/faq.html#testsfail -- and this release note: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/releasenotes.html#1_4_0_limitations.  \nYou thinking we should talk about particular OS versions?  That might be \na tough one since we have only limited experience  Recently we&#39;ve been \nrunning on suse 9.3 because it holds out the (as yet unfulfilled) \npromise of a stable 64-bit JVM.  Previous we ran with recent versions of \nfedoras.  Before that it was debian but we had the release noted issues.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
