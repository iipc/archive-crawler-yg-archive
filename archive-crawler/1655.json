Either thecrawler doesnt crawl pages beyond the seed or it \nseems to crawl everything.\n\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gsellek&quot; &lt;gsellek@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; This time I&#39;m trying to narrow my crawls down to html.  Tom \n&gt; emerson&#39;s doc in the FAQ is not available at the moment, so I&#39;m \n&gt; guessing on how to do this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve added the content type regex filters to my midfetch and ARC \n&gt; writers, which seems to be working.  But, non text is still getting \n&gt; added to my frontier, which means I crawl (and then abort) a lot of \n&gt; things I don&#39;t need.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I was going to add a postselector regex filter to only add text \n&gt; back into the frontier to crawl.  But, the filters have me \nconfused, \n&gt; and it does not seem to be behaving as I would expect.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have the following settings:\n&gt; \n&gt; filters ? Filters applied to this processor \n&gt;         URI ? URI regexp filter. \n&gt;           enabled:  ?    True  \n&gt;           if-match-return:  ?  True  \n&gt;           regexp:  ? .*\n&gt; \n(&#92;.gif|&#92;.jpeg|&#92;.jpg|&#92;.mov|&#92;.bmp|&#92;.pic|&#92;.png|&#92;.tiff|&#92;.tif|&#92;.css|&#92;.js|&#92;\n&gt; .swf|&#92;.qt|&#92;.mpeg|&#92;.mpg|&#92;.mp3|&#92;.avi|&#92;.wav|&#92;.wmv|&#92;.pdf|&#92;.doc|&#92;.xls|&#92;.c\ns\n&gt; v|&#92;.ppt)$   \n&gt;       seed-redirects-new-seed:  ?  True  \n&gt;       override-logger:  ?    True \n&gt; \n&gt; The thought being if it matches the regex then don&#39;t add it into \nthe \n&gt; frontier.  If I set the if-match-return to True, nothing seems to \n&gt; get added to it.  But, if I set it to false, a lot of .gif \n&gt; and .jpegs are getting in.  I guess I just don&#39;t understand this \n&gt; whole filter thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?  (In general, I&#39;d rather use a regex to filter out \nthings \n&gt; as above rather than in, but that could be done if necessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Greg\n\n\n\n\n"}}
