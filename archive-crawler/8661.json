It looks\n&gt; like you managed to figure out the tricky parts, and document them,\n&gt; before I had a chance to do it myself! Thank you for that. At some\n&gt; point I&#39;d like to get some of your insights into the umbra readme.\n&gt; Anyone is welcome to accelerate that process by sending a pull\n&gt; request. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Also want to briefly discuss your results:\n&gt; https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/Integrating+Umbra+And+Heritrix+3\n&gt; &quot;And then we ran some harvest jobs using umbra, on various interesting\n&gt; sites including twitter, facebook, youtube, and bt.dk. Running\n&gt; harvests takes more time than developing code or learning APIs so this\n&gt; part of the investigation was unfortunately cut rather short. In our\n&gt; specific harvests we found very few cases where umbra identified urls\n&gt; which were not also found by the heritrix extractor. The only ones we\n&gt; were reasonably sure about were some JSON queries in twittter.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As you probably know, umbra runs a &quot;behavior&quot; on each web page that it\n&gt; loads. These behaviors can be customized for different urls, and they\n&gt; can do things like scroll through the page, click on different\n&gt; elements, etc. So far we have only developed a handful of customized\n&gt; behaviors. Of the 4 sites you mentioned, only facebook has a custom\n&gt; behavior in umbra at this point. That does mean that the facebook\n&gt; pages you harvested should have benefited from umbra. For urls without\n&gt; an assigned custom behavior, umbra falls back on a default behavior.\n&gt; The main thing the default behavior does is scroll to the bottom of\n&gt; the page, and keep scrolling if more content is loaded. The twitter\n&gt; json queries were probably a result of that scrolling.\n&gt; https://github.com/internetarchive/umbra/tree/master/umbra/behaviors.d\n&gt; Pull requests for additional behaviors are also very welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; Noah\n&gt;\n&gt; On Mon, Feb 2, 2015 at 2:57 AM, Colin Rosenthal\n&gt; csr@...
