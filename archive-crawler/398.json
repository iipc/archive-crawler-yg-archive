I need\n&gt; this functionality to save copies of sites for evidential purposes.\n\nKristinn&#39;s answer covers the Heritrix view, but I wonder if Heritrix\nis overkill for that: wget can mirror a site, rewriting most URLs,\nquite effectively. It&#39;s also very fast.\n\nIf you wanted to use Heritrix you could also extract the sites from\nthe ARC files for browsing: presumably the Wayback machine is doing\nthis in some way.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
