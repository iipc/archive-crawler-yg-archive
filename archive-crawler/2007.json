Now I have\nupdated to Heritrix 1.4 (with JDK 1.4) and get the following error\nmessage: &quot;name is not a valid java type (or is a reserved word):\nsettings-directory&quot;\n\nIf I use JDK 1.5 everything works fine - but for a costumer I need to\nuse JDK 1.4.\n\nWhen I took a look at the MANIFEST in the JAR file of Heritrix I saw\nthat it was compiled with JDK 1.5. So I rebuild Heritrix from the\nsources with JDK 1.4.\n\nBut still the above described error happens as before.\n\nThanks in advance for your help,\nHolger\n\n\n\n"}}
