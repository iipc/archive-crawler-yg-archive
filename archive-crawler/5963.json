(We could definitely improve the error \nmessage, and maybe tolerate record-oblivious compression, though the \nrecord-at-a-time technique is part of the WARC spec.)\n\nAlternatively, if you are experiencing this error with a WARC that has \nnot been uncompressed-and-then-recompressed, could you attach an example \nWARC (in as abbreviated form as possible) to the issue, with details of \nhow it was created?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nsykushel wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; I have opened a bug http://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1653 (I didn&#39;t\n&gt; find the group earlier)\n&gt; Can anyone please have a look there and comment?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a lot,\n&gt; Shaul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
