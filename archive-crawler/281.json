Then, go back to the metadata-line\nand fill in the actual length when done.\n\n(Such length-patching would be very difficult if the metadata-line is\nwithin one of the compressed GZIP segments; however, metadata-lines could\nbe written to the file with a GZIP setting of &quot;no compression&quot;,\nallowing such random edits and possibly offering other random-seek\nand index-reconstruction benefits.)\n\nThe benefit of writing to the ARC before the length is known would be to\nreduce the need for temporary files -- and a redundant read/rewrite --\nwhen resources exceed the size of the in-memory per-URI/thread buffers.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
