(Yes I\n&gt; did write the script!) I feel it is much better than the regular\n&gt; checkpointing.\nGood.\n&gt;\n&gt; The crawlers are running into OOME in a day but I&#39;ll see if\n&gt; checkpointing + recover would make them run longer. If that&#39;s the case\n&gt; maybe I&#39;ll setup daily checkpointing and restart...\nSo you&#39;re OOME&#39;ing after running for a day?   Do you have a large seed \nlist (You&#39;ve mentioned 5k seed list in the past)?  Did you ever say what \nyour OS is?  You say its linux and your JVM is 1.5.0_05-b05 but is it  a \nrecent kernel and glibc?  What is the size of your bdbje cache?  If \ndefault -- 60% -- you might set it down to 30% or 20% or so especially \nusing Bloom already seen.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; -joe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Computer security \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+security&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=BHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWDg&gt; \n&gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+training&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=v0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
