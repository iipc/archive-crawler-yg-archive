If so, be aware most se=\r\narch engines ban \n&gt; robots from their results pages.\n&gt; \n&gt; In your private m=\r\nail, you included a &#39;scope&#39; configuration which only \n&gt; had one DecideRule,=\r\n to accept URIs of your patterns. Working scopes\nhave \n&gt; many rules, includ=\r\ning some to support the fetching of prerequisite\nURIs. \n&gt; As you forwarded =\r\nyour scope, it would not accept a seed URI (such as a \n&gt; search engine resu=\r\nlts page) that did not fit the pattern, nor allow \n&gt; certain preqrequisite =\r\nfetches to complete.\n&gt; \n&gt; I always recommend starting with a default, worki=\r\nng scope, then \n&gt; incrementally changing it to match your needs -- leaving =\r\nmost of it \n&gt; unchanged.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; ramc=\r\nhandra_narkhede wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Gordon,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First of all thanks for the =\r\nreply.
