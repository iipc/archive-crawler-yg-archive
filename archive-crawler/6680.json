Perhaps when the WarcWriter writes a revisit record? It is not set=\r\n to zero but the size of detected duplicate is very substantially lower bas=\r\ned on the crawl.log than either the crawl-report or the deduplicator proces=\r\nsor-report indicate (the latter two both relying on the contentSize are in =\r\nfull agreement about the volume of duplicate data).\n\nThis discrepancy makes=\r\n it impossible to rebuild the crawl-report from the crawl.log if a crawl te=\r\nrminates abnormally.
