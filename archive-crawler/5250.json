I&#39;m using following commands.\n&gt; maven java:compile\n&gt; maven test\n&gt; Once this is done a jar file under target directory is created. Now\n&gt; how can we execute heritrix using this jar file.\n\nHave you consulted the Heritrix Developer&#39;s Manual? Neither \n&quot;java:compile&quot; nor &quot;test&quot; are the proper maven targets for a full \nrunnable distribution build.\n\nMaven is used to build exactly the final distribution which is offered \nfor douwnload, so when you have Maven working properly, you launch a \nmaven-built Heritrix exactly the same as a prebuilt Heritrix.\n\n(Note that the dev manual officially describes Heritrix 1.X, which is \nbuilt with Maven 1.02. Still, it may be helpful in understanding things \nabout Heritrix 2.X, which is built with Maven 2.)\n\n&gt; Actually I&#39;m trying to customize heritrix to increase the number of\n&gt; connections, so that we can crawl the site at faster rate, but cant\n&gt; get anywhere. Any further assistance would be appreciated.\n\nAre you certain the target site approves and can handle the kind of \nfaster rate that requires changing the code?\n\nRapid crawling can harm sites and trigger webmaster countermeasures. \nEven without changing the code, you can configure Heritrix to use very \nsmall delays -- small enough to negatively impact many small sites. So \nbe sure to be careful, to understand what impact you&#39;re having on sites, \nand to provide webmasters a way to contact you if you go down this path.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; ramchandra_narkhede wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Can We build Heritrix using java only( without using Maven ).\n&gt;&gt; Anything is possible!
