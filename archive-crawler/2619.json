I want to know\n&gt; if 6KB/s is an acceptable bandwidth? We have a tight schedule and want\n&gt; to crawl at the fastest possible.\n6KB/s seems low.  How many threads are you running?  Are they all \noccupied all the time?  Has the crawl just started or is the 6KB/s a \nmeasure taken after crawling a while.  What kind of hardware and what is \ntheoretical upper bound on the pipe you are using?\n\nOn fairly basic hardware with 200 threads, minutes after startup doing a \nbroad crawl, a megabyte per second and higher is not unusual.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I understand that Heritrix only limits a crawl of 1 uri per host\n&gt; at a time for politeness. Is it possible to circumvent this since we\n&gt; have the permission of the web owners to crawl their website?\n&gt;\nNot currently.  The model of one-URI-per-host-at-a-time is fairly deeply \ningrained.\n\n&gt; Aside from above, what could be the reason for the slow crawling? The\n&gt; following is the result when I use TOP in unix.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cpu(s):  0.3% us,  0.2% sy,  0.0% ni, 99.3% id,  0.0% wa,  0.2% hi, \n&gt; 0.0% si\n&gt; Mem:   1035664k total,   945060k used,    90604k free,    91592k buffers\n&gt; Swap:  2040244k total,   128092k used,  1912152k free,   252684k cached\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n\nYour top seems to show your crawler idle most of the time (If I&#39;m \nreading it correctly).  Study the crawler reports, particular the thread \nreports.  Are they all just in wait all the time?  How many hosts are \nyou crawling?  One?  If so, only one thread will be active against that \nhost.  Have you played with the min-delay-ms settings changing it from \ndefault of 2000?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Computer security \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+security&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=BHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWDg&gt; \n&gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+training&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=v0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
