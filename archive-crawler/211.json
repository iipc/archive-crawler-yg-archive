Let the crawler versioning scheme be MAJOR.MINOR.POINT_VERSION w/ \n&gt; qualifier of &#39;-dev&#39; while building toward &#39;stable&#39; versions. Examples \n&gt; would be 0.1.1-dev, 1.0.23, 2.0.1, etc. \n&gt; 2. Let our first release be 0.1.0. \n&gt; 3. Let increments to MAJOR or MINOR merit branching. Let the branch be \n&gt; named MAJOR.MINOR (I think &#39;.&#39; is disallowed so will have to be \n&gt; MAJOR_MINOR).\n&gt; 4. Releases made along a branch should only ever be bug fixes and should \n&gt; only ever increment POINT_VERSION. Such releases should be tagged \n&gt; MAJOR.MINOR.POINT_VERSION (Keeping this scheme, we&#39;ll be able to easily \n&gt; distingush branches and tags looking at cvs logs).  \n&gt; 5. Adding significant functionality should merit an increment to MINOR \n&gt; number while a suite of new functionality would merit an increase in \n&gt; MAJOR numbering (This last bullet item is pretty nebulous.  I think \n&gt; it&#39;ll just be &quot;obvious&quot; when its time to roll the MAJOR rather than MINOR).\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
