I have programmed a workaround within NetArchive \n&gt; Suite, however it doesn&#39;t always work.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having read the release notes of Heritrix 1.14.4, I would like some \n&gt; extra explanation on fix https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1756. \n&gt; Can I assume that when Heritrix transitions from status &quot;FINISHING&quot; to \n&gt; &quot;FINISHED&quot; all these reports have been generated? If not is there a \n&gt; reliable way to test this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Nicolas Giraud\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; D�veloppeur Archives du Web - Biblioth�que Nationale de France\n&gt; Web Archiving Developper - National Library of France\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
