If the latter, it will make a new job *based* on \nthe \n&gt; c=\r\nontent of the jar. Then you should see new directory under job \ndir).  \n&gt; I=\r\nf former, then I believe, it will just use order values as are on \n&gt; resump=\r\ntion (Is the resumed crawl running out of the checkpoint \ndirectory \n&gt; or o=\r\nut of the original job directory?).\n\nI was doing the former. seems like a b=\r\nad choice...\n\nAssuming I don&#39;t have any overrides, can I just pass it a jar=\r\n file \ncontaining both order.xml and seeds.txt?\n\nAlso, I have no idea how t=\r\no supply the 4th parameter (seeds) for \naddJob. I&#39;m just passing &quot;x&quot; for no=\r\nw because I thought it would pick \nit up from the jar file if I do the jar =\r\nfile thingy. Or should I \nspecify something else?\n\nCheers,\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
