It basically suggests allocating an \nins=\r\ntance of Heritrix and invoke its and CrawlJob&#39;s methods (either \ndirectly o=\r\nr via the mbean interface).  But it doesn&#39;t show how to add \na customized f=\r\nilter and/or processor to it.  For example, I created \nsome subclasses like=\r\n MyFilter, MyExtractor and MyWriterIndex, how do \nI attach them to the proc=\r\nessing chain? I read the developer manual \nand javadoc already but it&#39;s not=\r\n obvious to me how to do it. \nPhil\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this help: \n&gt; http://crawler.ar=\r\nchive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?EmbeddingHeritrix?\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; pchoy wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; Are there any examples on how to embed heritrix into a standal=\r\none \njava\n&gt; &gt; app?
