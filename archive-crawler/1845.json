I wondering how to run it for bigger scope.\n\nImagine i will like to craw a country, can a single heritrix machine\nhandle it? And how long it might take to finish the craw job?\n\nIs there anyway that we can setup a &quot;cluster&quot; for heritrix, say using\n5 pcs. So that a single craw job will distributed evenly to all\nmachines in the cluster for some kind of crawl balancing.  If not, how\ncan we expand heritrix for a huge crawl like this?\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
