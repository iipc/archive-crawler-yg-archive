If its broadscope, OOMEs are \nexpected: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/releasenotes.html#1_0_0_limitations.\n\nAnother reason for your OOMEs may be the following. Each completed job \nkeeps references to the main datastructures used crawling to make it so \nthe UI can go back and look at configuration and logs of old jobs.  \nThough these datastructures are emptied on job completion, these \ndatastructures themselves occupy quite a lot of space in the heap.  You \ncould restart Heritrix after every 3rd or 4th job completion.  This will \nclear the heap of the old job datastructures (We need to fix this aspect \nof our UI).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; waiting for ur suggestions,\n&gt; bala.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
