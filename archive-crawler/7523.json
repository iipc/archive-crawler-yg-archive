The size of the checkpoint\n&gt; directories in the state directory vary (see sample below).  Can you\n&gt; explain why?\n\nThe du command does not count disk usage twice. If you du each checkpoint\ndirectory on its own you may find that the total exceeds the capacity of the\ndisk because checkpoints use hard links to refer to shared resources.\n\nYou may also consider creating checkpoints at longer intervals to reduce the\nneed to manage them.\n\nTravis\n\n\n\n"}}
