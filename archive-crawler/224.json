Lets go w/ it.  See below for further comment.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;In our situation, I consider us to have been working on &quot;0.1.0&quot; --\n&gt;development, unstable, CVS-only. We&#39;ve put a &quot;heritrix-0_1_0&quot;\n&gt;label into CVS HEAD to reflect that.\n&gt;\n&gt;By decision -- and to work through release and numbering issues --\n&gt;we now want to make an official release. Because this is\n&gt;an external/&quot;stable&quot; (sorta) release, it will get an even\n&gt;minor number: 0.2.0.\n&gt;\n&gt;The first step should be to make sure the last 0.1.x series\n&gt;number is assigned, to collect any changes since the previous\n&gt;0.1.x label. So we&#39;d update any internal version-identifier\n&gt;strings to read &quot;0.1.1cvs&quot;, and then apply a &quot;heritrix-0_1_1&quot;\n&gt;label. Essentially, this is a &quot;release candidate&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Provided it passes muster, we&#39;d effect the necessary version-\n&gt;identifier string changes in source/config files to reflect a\n&gt;&quot;0.2.0&quot; version.  Then, we&#39;d apply a &quot;heritrix-0_2_0&quot; label\n&gt;and use so-labelled files to build an official release in all\n&gt;formats.\n&gt;\n&gt;Finally, internal software version identifiers would be updated to\n&gt;be &quot;0.3.0cvs&quot;, and a &quot;heritrix-0_3_0&quot; CVS label applied.\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;heritrix-0_1_1&quot;, &quot;heritrix-0_2_0&quot;, and &quot;heritrix-0_3_0&quot; would\n&gt;describe functionally identical code, with only the version\n&gt;identifiers changed. However, when remote users fetch and run\n&gt;anything from us, any displayed version number (in a User-Agent\n&gt;string, command-line stdout, or web admin UI) would make the\n&gt;pedigree of what they&#39;re running clear.\n&gt;\n&gt;If an &quot;0.2.1&quot; patch release becomes necessary, we would branch\n&gt;from the &quot;heritrix-0_2_0&quot; label, apply the necessary fixes,\n&gt;rev the internal version identifiers, apply the &quot;heritrix-0_2_1&quot;\n&gt;label, and build the 0.2.1 distribution from that branch.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI&#39;m fine w/ the above except the piece where we add labels of heritrix-0_1_x and heritrix-0_3_0 labels to the repository just before and after the heritrix-0_2_0 labeling.  I don&#39;t see any point in our having 3 labels for one repository state. Lets only use the heritrix-?.?.? label in the repository when making releases (whether dev or stable).  The updating (and committing) of our software version as maintained in config. files (project.xml) should be sufficent for making the &#39;pedigree&#39; of what it is that external users are running clear (I&#39;d also suggest no need of the &#39;cvs&#39; suffix for version numbers -- the &#39;odd&#39; numbering scheme should be signifier enough that current state is &#39;development&#39;).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;- Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
