Most probably they are found inside other \n  HTML documents which won&#39;t be matched by the regexps above. This \nshould be addressed somehow.\n\nRegards,\nSergey\n\n\n&gt; How can I download HTML files only from this path for example\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.SITENAME/MEMBERNAME &lt;http://www.SITENAME/MEMBERNAME&gt;(s)/TAG(S)/\n&gt; \n&gt; I used regexp\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.SITENAME/.*/TAG &lt;http://www.SITENAME/.*/TAG&gt;(S)/\n&gt; \n&gt; With URIregExpFilter in FilterDecideRule , but it didn&#39;t work , any \n&gt; suggestion ?\n\n"}}
