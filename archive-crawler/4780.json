Then check if \n&gt; hasNext has been called more then once for each next().\n&gt;\n&gt; Or, see if you can fix the ArchiveReader iterator and share the code. :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; */Christoph Buescher &lt;sterntaufe@...&gt;/* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     exactly in this order and always one after each other. This, however,\n&gt;     seems to be a very strict constraint for a standard Java-Iterator. The\n&gt;     problem arises because I don&#39;t want to load all the records right\n&gt;     away,\n&gt;     but let out processing pipeline request new records from an ArcReader\n&gt;     when it needs one. In our scenario we can&#39;t assure that the client\n&gt;     using\n&gt;     the ArcReader is well-behaved and always gets the next record after\n&gt;     right after calling &quot;next()&quot;. It might just want to know several times\n&gt;     if there is something left to process and then get the record some\n&gt;     time\n&gt;     later...\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
