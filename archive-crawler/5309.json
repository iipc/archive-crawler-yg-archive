Here are some of my\ninitial thoughts.\n\n- In general, I would do analysis off-line and not during the crawl.\n\n- See if Browser Monkeys will scale for this project. If yes, then you get\nyou javascript engine, events simulations, dom and all other wonders of a\nbrowser for &quot;free&quot;.\n\n- If you decide to fetch two pages for cloaking detection be sure that\nfetches are coming from different ip addresses/ranges. Also, be sure that\nfor &quot;browser&quot; fetches you don&#39;t make robots.txt requests. This is a\ntelltale to spammers that you are bot regardless of the IP address,\nuser-agent and other http request headers. This kind of dual fetching can\neasily be done with Heritrix&#39;s proxy setting and probably a beanshell\nprocessor.\n\n- As you already pointed out, dual fetching can be expensive. However,\nsampling is probably a good way to go given that spammers are usually\nambitious/greedy. So, fetching a couple of pages per host will probably be\ngood enough. I recommend slash page plus one other link of it.\n\n- As a part of a wish list, it would be good to check how often webmasters\nimplement beneficial cloaking (removing session ids, parameters and etc.).\nAlso, if Flash has been a new spamming medium.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n&gt; Hi everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have established a web page (at\n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Web+Spam+Detection+for+Heritrix)\n&gt; for my project &quot;Web Spam Detection for Heritrix&quot; on Heritrix wiki I\n&gt; will keep updating it during development. Comments are welcome.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; - Ping\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
