Heritrix goes through the set of rules in order and for each rule s=\r\nets the status of the URI being tested to ACCEPT, REJECT, or PASS. At the e=\r\nnd of the decide rules, the status in place is the one used, so even if you=\r\nr MatchesListRegexDecideRule rejects the URI, a later rule may change that =\r\nstatus to ACCEPT. For example, your regex might rule out the URI, but if af=\r\nter that rule you have a TransclusionDecideRule, that &quot;accepts any URI whos=\r\ne path-from-seed ends in at least one non-navlink hop&quot; (https://webarchive.=\r\njira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Configuring+Crawl+Scope+Using+DecideRules) a=\r\nnd is generally used to accept embedded content such as images and videos n=\r\no matter the URI pattern, the URI would be ruled back in to acceptance. You=\r\n could try moving your MatchesListRegexDecideRule lower in the chain of rul=\r\nes and see if that helps.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lauren Ko\n&gt; &gt; Web Archiving Programmer\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; UNT Libraries\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: arch=\r\nive-crawler@yahoogroups.com [archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com ] on behalf of=\r\n matteo.ceccarello@ [matteo.ceccarello@]\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, January 29, 201=\r\n3 6:26 AM\n&gt; &gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; Subject: [archive-cr=\r\nawler] [Heritrix 3] exclude images, videos and archives from being crawled\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi all, we are trying to exclude images, videos and archives from t=\r\nhe set of URIs being crawled with a MatchesListRegexDecideRule:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;.*&#92;.(jpeg|jpg|png|tiff|gif)$&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;.*&#92;.(mpg|webm|=\r\nogg|flv)$&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;.*&#92;.(mp3|oga|wav)$&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;.*&#92;.(iso|tar|gz|zip|rar|ex=\r\ne)$&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However this doesn&#39; seem to work: images still app=\r\near in the crawl log.
