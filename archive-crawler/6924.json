When cr=\r\nawling specific sites that can handle large amounts of traffic, the paralle=\r\nl queues option can be used to open many concurrent crawling connections to=\r\n a single site.&quot;\n\nmeaning if I want to crawl only a specific site by multip=\r\nle connections how can I do it? \n\nThanks a lot!\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/16/10 1:39 AM, yotp=\r\no.official wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m pretty new to Heritrix 3 and despite my v=\r\nery good impression of the code and it&#39;s ability, I&#39;m having problems with =\r\na couple of things:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.

How do i make the multiple queuing =\r\nto work? does it happens automatically?\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you mean by &quot;multiple =\r\nqueueing&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. I configed the cxml file so I wont process all the jpg=\r\n/gif/png files but my logs still show me (Mimetypes) i process them.  this =\r\nis what I did:\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bean class=3D&quot;org.archive.modules.deciderules.MatchesLi=\r\nstRegexDecideRule&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;            &lt;property name=3D&quot;decision&quot; value=3D&quot;REJ=\r\nECT&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;!--&lt;property name=3D&quot;listLogicalOr&quot; value=3D&quot;true&quot; /&gt;  --=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;!--&lt;property name=3D&quot;regexList&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;             &lt;list&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n                &lt;value&gt;.*(?i)(&#92;.css(&#92;?.*)?)$&lt;/value&gt;\n&gt; &gt;                   =\r\n&lt;value&gt;.*(&#92;.bmp|&#92;.gif|&#92;.jpg|&#92;.png|bmp))$&lt;/value&gt;\n&gt; &gt;             &lt;/list&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;            &lt;/property&gt;  --&gt;\n&gt; &gt;      &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; what is my mistake??=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A definite problem is that your &#39;regexList&#39; property element is insid=\r\ne \n&gt; XML comment markers -- &quot;&lt;!-- ... --&gt;&quot; -- so is not a part of the activ=\r\ne \n&gt; configuration.\n&gt; \n&gt; A possible problem could be the relative location =\r\nof this rule with \n&gt; respect to other scope rules; if this comes early, but=\r\n then a later rule \n&gt; ACCEPTs the same URIs, the later rule wins.\n&gt; \n&gt; You =\r\nregexes also seem a bit suboptimal -- the CSS part could be mixed in \n&gt; wit=\r\nh the others, BMP doesn&#39;t need to be listed twice, you may want the \n&gt; case=\r\n-insensitive indicator for all suffixes, etc. -- but looks vaguely \n&gt; funct=\r\nional for your purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
