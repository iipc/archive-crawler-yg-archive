If you can supply more details \nabout your configuration and the error you saw, we might be able to get \nto the bottom of the issue. One thing to watch out for: any state \ndirectory provided as a &#39;preload-source&#39; should *not* also be the target \nstate directory for the current crawl.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 5/20/10 6:33 PM, steve@... wrote:\n&gt; hi Solomon,\n&gt;\n&gt; the getClassCatalog() problem was encountered in HER-1627 due\n&gt; to misconfiguration in H1, but it required a patch in H3 due\n&gt; to a change in the PersistProcessor implementation from H1\n&gt; to H3.\n&gt;\n&gt; PersistLogProcessor is still recommended for H1 dedupe config\n&gt; as described here:\n&gt;\n&gt; Deduping (Duplication Reduction)\n&gt; https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/x/aoFz\n&gt;\n&gt; hope that helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; /steve@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 5/18/10 9:43 AM, Solomon Gibbs wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; HI,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to get deduplication working in Heritrix 1.14.4.
