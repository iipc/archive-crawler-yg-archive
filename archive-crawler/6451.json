The problem here is the code actually checks =\r\nfor the &#39;/&#39; count and rejects any URI based on this count.\n\nIdeally there s=\r\nhould have been only 3 `/&#39; for 4 path segments. Since there are two after h=\r\nttp://, the number of segments match the number of `/&#39;.\n\nSo it actually acc=\r\nepts an URI like\nhttp://localhost:8080/TestHeritrix/211\n\nBut rejects the sa=\r\nme url with a &#39;/&#39; at the end\nhttp://localhost:8080/TestHeritrix/211/\n\nHas a=\r\nnyone gone through the same issue?\n\nThanks,\nSubha.\n\n\n"}}
