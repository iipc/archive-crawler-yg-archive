Although heritrix-1.3.0.jar was at the front \nof my CLASSPATH, it turns out that Heritrix gets its jarfile\nvia the $HERITRIX_HOME environment variable, which I had not \nbothered to reset from heritrix-1.2.0/.\n\nI fleshed out the heritrix-1.3.0/ directory with bin/ and conf/\nand then repointed $HERITRIX_HOME to it.  All is now well.\n\nSt. Ack also asked:\n\n&gt; if I try and shove the parent CrawlURI into the \n&gt; CandidateURI#alist using putObject, I get serialization \n&gt; exceptions out of BdbFrontier when it schedules/queues \n&gt; the resulting CrawlURI. Being able to add any old &#39;Object&#39; \n&gt; to a CandidateURI/CrawlURI is just asking for trouble.\n&gt; Is this going to be a problem for you?\n\nNo problem.  I am copying only basic ints, floats, & strings \nfrom CrawlURI to CandidateURI.  \n\nMany thanks to Michael Stack for making all those code changes\n(and very promptly, too!) to allow the possibility of parent\nCrawlURIs passing information to its child CandidateURIs.  In\nthe long run I suspect it will be a plus to have AList hidden\nfrom us; calling &quot;put&quot;s and &quot;get&quot;s right on the URIs is neat.\nAlso, the overridable Postselector.createCandidateURI is in\nfact a very elegant way to minimize the amount of Postselector\nthat needs to be overridden by a subclass of it.\n\nbergmark_d, happy camper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
