My guess would be css that&#39;s generated dynami=\r\ncally on the server side, in which case that shouldn&#39;t present special prob=\r\nlems for crawling. Heritrix does extract links from css. If you mean css ge=\r\nnerated dynamically on the client side using javascript, then that&#39;s tricki=\r\ner. Heritrix does its best to guess urls from javascript strings, but that =\r\nlink extraction can easily be foiled. Can you explain the problem further, =\r\nperhaps with example urls?\n&gt; \n&gt; Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; On 2011-08-09 04:27 , mike.pavlen=\r\nko wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using heritrix-1.14.4 and there are 3 different sites wit=\r\nh dynamic CSS.
