I want it to get 10 pages from each seed, not including pages from =\r\noutlinks of the seed. I set the number of documents limit in the configurat=\r\nion file to 10, and it passed that. Set it to 20, passed it again. If that&#39;=\r\ns not the right tweak, where should I set the limit for it to work?\nAbout l=\r\neaving out external pages, I have 100+ sites to crawl, so I can&#39;t set regex=\r\nes matching every single URL (and don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a better way rather=\r\n than that.)\n\nI&#39;d appreciate any help.\n\n\n"}}
