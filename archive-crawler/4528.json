Maybe there is a case when this is needed, however I cannot see it. \nDo you have a case that you can share on this list? That might help me \nunderstand what exactly you are trying to do.\n\nAlso, send over the scheduler&#39;s decide rules and some URIs examples and \nI will take a look at it.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n&gt; Thanks Igor.\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel very happy to have your kind reply and it cleared \n&gt; up my question about the role of LinkScoper.\n&gt; DecideRuleSequence in decide-rules worked well and \n&gt; I achieved crawls as I expected.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I have one more question. How about place some rules\n&gt; in Scheduler#decide-rules ? I placed rules rejecting\n&gt; some unwilling URIs in Scheduler#decide-rules as a test.\n&gt; But when vieweing Frontier URIs by pausing the job,\n&gt; those unwilling URIs showed up in the Frontier URIs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, as I wrote at the begging of this post,\n&gt; my crawlings are comming along using DecideRuleSequence \n&gt; in decide-rules. I say thanks again, Igor.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hello Takashi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I suggest that you use the DecidingScope to scope the crawler.\n&gt;&gt; To learn more about this scope check the user manual here:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/config.html#decidingscope\n&gt;&gt; By studying the decide rules you will learn that most common way to \n&gt;&gt; reject URIs is via regular expressions and SURT prefixes within the \n&gt;&gt; DecidingScope sequence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; LinkScoper rules on which extracted (not scheduled) links, of a crawled \n&gt;&gt; URI, are within the scope. Links that are not in the scope are \n&gt;&gt; disregarded. The links that are in the scope are &quot;promoted&quot; to \n&gt;&gt; CandidateURIs (if not CandidateURIs already) and later scheduled to be \n&gt;&gt; crawled.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The decide rules of the LinkScoper itself simply decide if the\n&gt;&gt; LinkScoper will be skipped the next processor in the processor chain\n&gt; or not.\n&gt;&gt; If the LinkScoper is skipped, I believe that getting ClassCastException \n&gt;&gt; errors is to be expected.  The extractors create Link and not \n&gt;&gt; CandidateURI links needed by Scheduler. However, if you use your own \n&gt;&gt; extractors that create CAndidateURI links, skipping the LinkScoper \n&gt;&gt; simple means that all extracted links will be scheduled.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want to reject already schedule links, that can be done with \n&gt;&gt; Preselector&#39;s options like recheck-scope, block-all and etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I hope this helps.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Take care,\n&gt;&gt; i.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
