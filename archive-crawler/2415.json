Thanks for the tip. Now I must get\n&gt; stuff from the httpRecorder().getRecordedInput() with a\n&gt; RecordingInputStream right? Is this the simplest way to get the whole\n&gt; document?\n\nYou probably want to use HttpRecorder.getReplayInputStream(), to get\na stream from which you can read exactly what was &#39;recorded&#39; at the\nearlier fetch step. This is what the existing ARC-writing code uses.\n(In contrast, getRecordedInput() will return the actual input-stream\nwhich was used as a wrapper for the initial recording, which is unlikely\nto be in a usable state for more reading.)\n\nIf you prefer a CharSequence interface (for example to perform\nregex matching), you could use getReplayCharSequence() instead. Most\nexisting extractorinterprets the recorded data with respect to a\ncharacter-encoding, it&#39;s not the raw, byte-for-byte exact copy that\nthe replay-input-stream provides.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
