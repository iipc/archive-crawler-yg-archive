Model reminds of me of apache &#39;.htaccess&#39; \nfile scheme where you can insert directory specific config. to override \nthe core httpd.conf.  I like it.  Below are some general \ncomments/questions:\n\n+ Does the order file change as you do a crawl?  Where is state kept?  \nWhat if you want to tweak a setting during a crawl.  Where would that be \ndone?  Would you change the order file or would you instead change UI \nand its value would be save to a state file subsequently used crawling?  \nWould such a change be one of the &#39;dynamic settings&#39; from the global \nconfiguration file saved at the head of the configuration dir \n(&#39;overrides&#39; for the order file) mentioned in your doc.?\n+ Why can&#39;t I set any value?  What if during a crawl I want to up the \nnumber of running threads or change the logging levels or the way in \nwhich statistics are being gathered (e.g. move from &#39;pedestrian&#39; crawl \nto debug mode) or even instantiate new processors and change the order \nin which the processor chain works.  Some settings won&#39;t be changeable \nmid-crawl and these might fail w/ a polite message (e..g. changing heap \nsize mid-run) but otherwise, I&#39;d suggest no constraint on what can be \nchanged in configuration (Keep in mind I don&#39;t know much about crawler \ndeploys).\n+ I&#39;d imagine in the scheme of things, the reading of a new \nconfiguration file into memory, whether per host or per domain, a rare \nevent.  Do you agree?  At what time are the domain/host configuration \nfiles read?  On initially crossing into a new domain or on first seeing \na host?  Will we ever refresh what we have in mem?\n+ What are the plans for having multiple crawler instances working off \nthe one Frontier instance?  If the frontier makes a CrawlServer to \nassociate w/ a URI, how will we ensure that one crawler instance does \none server only (Maybe frontier can do distribution between crawlers).\n+ Won&#39;t there only be one instance of the configuration instance in \nmemory? It won&#39;t be duplicated per CrawlerServer -- just a reference to \nthe single instance?  Why then are we worried about XML DOM cost?  Won&#39;t \nthe configuration just be read into an object tree w/ an xml serializer \nused creating the objects w/ periodic visits to the file on disk to \ncheck mod time?  The serializer would do something like, if a value \nexists at a certain node in the configuration hierarchy, a getter that \nreturns the value at that location in the hierarchy is returned, else, \nwe call super.  Or are we talking of doing per host an aggregation of \nall xml snippets to write a new configuration file to feed the crawler \naccessing a particular host?\n+ Author, date and section numbering make it easier to refer to a \ndocument and its sections.\n+ Later we might use an ldap server implementation behind your \n&#39;Configuration&#39; reader class to store config.  The hierarchical nature \nof the configuration w/ a rare write would make it a natural match.\n\nOther comments:\n\n+ Is CrawlServer class to do w/ crawl accessing a particular server?  \nMaybe rename it Server?\n+ I have comments on the xml -- no schema nor dtd and extensive use of \nelement attributes -- but they can go elsewhere.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n"}}
