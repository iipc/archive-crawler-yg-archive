\nstructure), there are a couple of recent bugs affecting H1 through \n1.14.4 and H3 through 3.0.0 you should be aware of:\n\nHER-1786 BloomFilter32bitSplit (default in H1) breaks for bitfields &gt; 512MiB\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1786\n\nHER-1783 BloomFilter64bit bit-length bug prevents full bitfield from \nbeing used; premature saturation\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1783\n\nIn a nutshell for H1 users (HER-1786):\n\nIf you&#39;re using BloomUriUniqFilter *and* have increased the size so the \ninternal bitfield is larger than 512MiB (which is uncommon and \ninconvenient to do, as it requires changing system properties), that \nextra-large bloom filter will not be performing properly -- it will have \nmuch worse false-positive behavior, after a much-smaller number of \ninserts, because of an int/long problem in the internally-generated hash \nvalues.\n\nCurrent auto-builds have been fixed, and the eventual 1.14.5 release \n(date uncertain) won&#39;t have the problem.\n\nIf in H1 you&#39;re not using BloomUriUniqFilter, or haven&#39;t tried to use a \nlarger-than-default filter, you&#39;re not affected.\n\nIn a nutshell for H3 users (HER-1783):\n\nDifferent but similar problems affected even the default-sized internal \nbloom filter used by BloomUriUniqFilter -- so any use would see much, \nmuch higher false-positive rates -- approaching 100% even before \nreaching the configured-at-instantiation number-of-inserts.\n\nCurrent auto-builds have been fixed, and the eventual 3.0.1 release \n(date uncertain) won&#39;t have the problem.\n\nThe fix(es):\n\nThe myriad of investigational BloomFilter implementations that \npreviously existed have been consolidated into one better-tested \nimplementation class, BloomFilter64bit, that supports bitfields through \nany conceivable heap size.\n\nThe number of ongoing crawls affected by this may very well be &quot;zero&quot; \nbut I wanted to highlight the risk and fixes just in case.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
