Do you have the JMX \nflags enabled for the JVM you are hosting hcc in?  (Or is hcc hosted in \nJBOSS?  If the latter, then there *should* be JMX servers available.)\n\nHeritrix should be deregistering with JNDI each instance if its been a \nclean shutdown.  See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#1545.  \nSee in same file the getJndiContainerName method which constructs the \nJNDI name per instance -- they take a similar format to names used \nregistering with JMX.\n\nThe JNDI registry in JBOSS is RAM-based so with a controlled start/stop \nof JBOSS followed by startup and shutdown of Heritrix, you should see a \nHeritrix instance come and go in the JNDI registry (JBOSS MBean screen \ncan be hard to navigate: you might search using a string like \n&#39;org.archive.crawler:*&#39;).\n\nThere is no way currently to name the default Heritrix instance on the \ncommand line.\n\nJNDI is used as a central place all Heritrix instances register \nthemselves to.  hcc goes there to figure all members participating in \nthe cluster.  The name of instances in JNDI includes the JMX address so \nhcc, once its found an instance in JNDI, subsequently knows where to \nsend its JMX controlling operations.\n \nIf you are deploying Heritrix in JBOSS, then it provides the JMX Agent \nHeritrix will register itself with (and via which hcc will send JMX \noperations to get to the Heritrix instance).  Otherwise, enable the JMX \nsettings on your JVM so Heritrix registers itself with the JVM JMX Agent.\n\nHTH,\nSt.Ack\n\n\nAndrea Goethals wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve been trying for a few days to get hcc working but still am having\n&gt; trouble figuring out all the pieces. I&#39;ve followed the hcc Overview\n&gt; page (http://crawler.archive.org/hcc/apidocs/index.html \n&gt; &lt;http://crawler.archive.org/hcc/apidocs/index.html&gt;) and the\n&gt; emails we have about it from this list. I&#39;m new to JBOSS and JMX but\n&gt; have gotten the JBOSS part of it working. I can start up JBOSS as a\n&gt; name service, start a heritrix instance up and then initialize an hcc\n&gt; ClusterControllerBean. After I call init() on the\n&gt; ClusterControllerBean I get a NullPointerException in my console:\n&gt;\n&gt; Starting ClusterControllerBean\n&gt; May 24, 2007 1:56:15 PM org.archive.hcc.ClusterControllerBean init\n&gt; INFO: maxPerContainer setting: 1\n&gt; May 24, 2007 1:56:15 PM org.archive.hcc.ClusterControllerBean$3 run\n&gt; INFO: running poll task...\n&gt; java.lang.NullPointerException\n&gt; at \n&gt; org.archive.hcc.ClusterControllerBean.registerMBean(ClusterControllerBean.java:833)\n&gt; at \n&gt; org.archive.hcc.ClusterControllerBean.init(ClusterControllerBean.java:817)\n&gt; at \n&gt; edu.harvard.hul.ois.wax.crawl.CrawlController.main(CrawlController.java:44)\n&gt; Started ClusterControllerBean\n&gt; May 24, 2007 1:56:15 PM org.archive.hcc.ClusterControllerBean$3 run\n&gt; INFO: poll task done.\n&gt; May 24, 2007 1:57:15 PM org.archive.hcc.ClusterControllerBean$3 run\n&gt; INFO: running poll task...\n&gt;\n&gt; Besides getting help with this exception - how can I get the hcc\n&gt; source? It&#39;s not bundled with the heritrix src code and I only get the\n&gt; *.class files in the hcc jar from CruiseControl.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see this in JBOSS&#39; JNDIView:\n&gt; +- org.archive.crawler (class: org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContext)\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this the Heritrix instance? Even when I stop my heritrix instance\n&gt; it still is listed in the JNDIView.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way to name the heritrix crawler from the command line\n&gt; start-up? I saw that you can do this from the heritrix web GUI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m having trouble understanding which ports are needed to get\n&gt; hcc & heritrix working. I need to change the default ports for JBOSS,\n&gt; hcc and heritrix to keep my used ports within a certain range on some\n&gt; overused machines. I have these set:\n&gt; * JNDI port set in JBOSS and in the jndi.properties accessible by all\n&gt; 3 of the ClusterControllerClient, ClusterControllerServer and the\n&gt; heritrix instances\n&gt; * Heritrix GUI port\n&gt; * JBOSS JMX Client ports\n&gt; Is the JNDI port all that the hcc and heritrix classes need or do they\n&gt; also need a JMX port? By using JBOSS for the name service does this\n&gt; mean we are using it for the JMX agent?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry about the number of questions here!\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Andrea\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
