Study this module to see how it \nworks (Also see the developer&#39;s manual on writing processors).\n\nCurrently title, description and keywords are not extracted but it \nshouldn&#39;t be hard to amend the ExtractorHTML, a processor that runs \nearlier than ARCWriterProcessor in the processing chain, so it extracts \nthis metadata.  Its already reading META headers to see if crawling is \nbarred by a robots META-tag so keywords and description should be \nstraight-forward.  For title, you&#39;d have to add a special case to the \nRELEVANT_TAG_EXTRACTOR regex.   Your extraction-additions would write \nthe discovered metadata into the &#39;cart&#39; that gets passed down along the \nprocessing chain, the CrawlURI.   This laden CrawlURI will be passed \ninto your db writer (CrawlURI is where you get the pointers to the \ndownloaded content).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; any pointers are welcome\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks in advance\n&gt;\n&gt; sivaji\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
