My end goal is to send heritrix \na job of say 10,000 domains to crawl, have it crawl for some finite \nperiod of time (x hours or x pages), and then stop the crawl, feed \nit another 10,000 pages and start again.\n\nI&#39;ve read the Wiki for the JMX controls and have Heritrix up in \njconsole right now (I know, not really command-line).  However I&#39;m \nnot sure what to do from here.  I&#39;m happy to RTFM, but currently I \ncan&#39;t find any info on things like scheduleSeed or scheduleFile.  \nCan anyone help me figure this out, give me an example, or even just \ngive me a URL and tell me to RTFM.  :)\n\nWhat do I need to do to auto-start a crawl with a predetermined set \nof parameters, somehow determine when it&#39;s done, rinse, repeat?\n\nThanks,\nGreg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
