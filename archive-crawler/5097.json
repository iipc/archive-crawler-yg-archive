I have been\ncrawling for months =\r\nnow with full contact information and received no\ncomplaints.\n\nMy standard =\r\ncrawl rate is 4 seconds, with a multiplier of 4.0.\n\nAnyway, back to the top=\r\nic of crawl-delay.\n\nI think crawl-delay is a badly designed non-standard ro=\r\nbots.txt\noption. Anyone could put any value that doesn&#39;t assist the crawl\no=\r\nperator in crawling their domain. Entering a value of crawl-delay of\n5 seco=\r\nnds. Doesn&#39;t stop 10 different crawlers from hitting the site at\nthe same t=\r\nime each requesting pages at 5 second intervals.\n\nMy own website often gets=\r\n hit by Google, Yahoo and Live at the same time.\n\nI do like Google&#39;s idea f=\r\nor the host-load option that defines how many\nthreads can crawl a domain at=\r\n the same time.\n\nHere&#39;s a link\n\nhttp://www.stonetemple.com/articles/intervi=\r\new-matt-cutts.shtml\n\n&gt; We put our crawler &quot;signature&quot; in Heritrix when we c=\r\nrawl the Internet. \n&gt; The signature is specified in the order.xml file. Her=\r\nitrix, as a user \n&gt; agent, will leave that signiture on the crawled site.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; The signature is in the form of a URL so people know where they can \n&gt; =\r\ncontact us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most of the time, people use email. There are rare cases w=\r\nhere people \n&gt; use formal letters to address their concerns.\n\n\n\n"}}
