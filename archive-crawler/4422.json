Default delay between retries is 15 minutes and maximum number of \nretires is 30. So, if you have problems fetching an URI, you will spend \nat least 7.5 hours of waiting and retiring if the problem persists.\n\nConsult the frontier report (reports tab in WUI) to see what is left to \nbe crawled.\n\nTo learn more about Heritrix crawl.log status codes please see FAQs or \nthe user manual.\n\nI hope this helps.\ni.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am feeding 2 Lacs seed to my heritrix instance and I am using\n&gt; QuotaEnforcer to limit 10 docs per host.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using SURT Rule in the Deciding Scope.\n&gt; max-hops : 5 in Too Hops Rule\n&gt; max-trans-hops : 5 in Trans Rule\n&gt; \n&gt; I use max-retries : 3 in BdbFrontier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please any tell me what is the reason behind this slow crawling after\n&gt; completion of 90%.\n&gt; \n&gt; I found all the URI having -2 [SocketTimeoutException@HTTP] HTTP code\n&gt; In my crawl.log file.\n&gt; \n&gt; So let me know what to do to get speed in the end as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jigar Patel\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
