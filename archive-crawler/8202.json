There was legacy code written and that uses getURI() to=\r\n do this. Since, I could not find any setter method(setURI()) on CrawlURI, =\r\nI planned to use getCanonicalString/setCanonicalString() instead of getURI(=\r\n).\n\nI would like to understand the impact of this change.\n\nsome differences=\r\n I found are,\n1. some letter in getURI()&#39;s result has UpperCase and those a=\r\nre lower case in getCanonoicalString()\n2. I could see some url result writt=\r\nen by getURI() starts with http://www. and the same was staring with http:/=\r\n/ using getCanonicalString().\n\nsome questions are,\n1. Is there an alternati=\r\nve to accomplish this task?\n2. Is there a way to setURI()?\n\nAny suggestions=\r\n would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in Advance,\nThamizh\n\n\n"}}
