I can&#39;t figure out\n&gt; what&#39;s causing it.  We have multiple servers with the same config\n&gt; BDB, SURT and Tom&#39;s text/html URI filter on the scope. They do have\n&gt; different seeds, and not all of them are doing it.  I can&#39;t seem to\n&gt; pinpoint anything that is casuing it.  I also went back to 1.2.0 on\n&gt; a server to try that out, and it too died with an OOM error using\n&gt; BDB and SURT.  I&#39;m no java guru, but I saw that you asked for a heap\n&gt; dump from Tom when this happened to him, so I&#39;m posting mine.  Maybe\n&gt; it will help.  I apologize for the long post, as I have included the\n&gt; dump below.\n\nHave you looked at the frontier reports page -- Hit the &#39;Reports&#39; tab, \nand then select &#39;Frontier Report&#39; -- to see how many queues are in \noperation?  Heritrix is going to have memory issues if the number of \nqueues are in the  tens of thousands (If this is the issue, you may have \nto further subdivide your seeds amongst crawls).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
