First of all i use heritrix\n&gt; version 1.3.0-200412111608. I wrote a lil processor\n&gt; and wanted to test if it can get accessed via\n&gt; heritrix&#39;s web-console... i have the class in\n&gt; classpath (i know that it works cuz i had exactly the\n&gt; same classpath-entry with the 1.2.0 release of\n&gt; heritrix and it worked there) i put the\n&gt; fully-qualified classname into the\n&gt; processors.options-file in conf&#92;modules (same goes\n&gt; here i tested it with 1.2.0 and it works without\n&gt; problems there)... Somehow i get the feeling there was\n&gt; something changed with the modules-loading procedure\n&gt; but i looked into the docs that came with the\n&gt; 1.3.0-200412111608 version but i didn&#39;T find a hint\n&gt; what i did wrong... Can anybody explain me what i did wrong??\n\nNo change in modules loading since 1.2.0 (Last change was reading the \nprocessors options file from the CLASSPATH rather than from filesystem \nbut that was done before 1.2.0).  Is there anything in the \nheritrix_out.log?  Are you adding your new processor and then rebuilding \nso your modified processors.options gets built into the heritrix.jar?\n\nYou can send over a patch and I can try stuff over on this end if \nthat&#39;ll help?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;            \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Take Yahoo!
