(There&#39;s an outstanding issue to add a web UI \noption.)\n\nI hope that you are using a stronger login combination than your example \nof &#39;admin:admin&#39;, and limiting access to the web UI port by one or both \nof (1) only binding/listening on localhost (the default); (2) other \nnetwork security measures.\n\nThe configuration UI of H3 allows reading and writing to arbitrary local \npaths (for configuration editing and file/log browsing) and the \nexecution of arbitrary Java code (via scripting in the UI and \ncrawl-configuration) -- as the user executing the Java VM. So, you \nshould protect access to the H3 user interface as strictly as logins to \nthe machine on which it is running. (The web UI can do as much as a \ncommand shell on the machine.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nPranay Pandey wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Look at the heritrix_out.log in $HERITRIX_HOME for some clue.\n&gt; I suspect your signal isn&#39;t killing all the processes properly. I use \n&gt; kill -9 and it guarantees a sure shot heritrix termination.\n&gt; Did you netstat for the port used by heritrix? I am quite sure, the \n&gt; default port would show up as occupied. Kill that process and you should \n&gt; be good to restart the engine.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Pranay\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On *Sun, 1/17/10, t.schoellhorn /&lt;t.schoellhorn@...&gt;/* wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     From: t.schoellhorn &lt;t.schoellhorn@...&gt;\n&gt;     Subject: [archive-crawler] Restarting Heritrix 3.0.0 keeps failing\n&gt;     To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     Date: Sunday, January 17, 2010, 4:21 AM\n&gt; \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;     Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt;     we are using Heritrix 3.0.0 to crawl snaphshots of about 500\n&gt;     Web-Sites. Now I had to restart the Heritrix Engine. As I don&#39;t know\n&gt;     the recommended way to stop the engine I &quot;killed&quot; it via its process\n&gt;     number (with signal 15).\n&gt; \n&gt;     The problem now is: I cannot restart the engine. When starting the\n&gt;     enging with &quot;bin/heritrix -a admin:admin&quot; the progress dots appear\n&gt;     enlessly.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Any ideas what I can do to start the engine again?\n&gt; \n&gt;     What is the recommended way to shut down the Crawler?\n&gt; \n&gt;     Cheers,\n&gt;     Tino\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
