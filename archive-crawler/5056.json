You could\nconfigure mul=\r\ntiple domains to point to that external domain. So that\nHeritrix would see =\r\nit as multiple websites. It would be tricky to\nconfigure the rules to preve=\r\nnt duplicate crawls, but it could be done\nI think.\n\nThis would require a po=\r\nst crawl cleaning of the archive to restore\ndomain names back to what they =\r\nshould be.\n\nThe other option is to run multiple Heritrix engines, and crawl=\r\n by\nclusters of that domains (i.e. www.cnn.com/news, www.cnn.com/weather,\nw=\r\nww.cnn.com/movies)\n\nI wouldn&#39;t advise hammering a single server with 3000 t=\r\nhreads.\n\n&gt; I have just deployed Heritrix and am in the process of trying to=\r\n\noptimize\n&gt; is. We are running it on an 8-core/16GB RAM server and in the p=\r\nassed\nwe have\n&gt; successfully used as many as 3000 threads on this machine w=\r\nhen\nscraping many\n&gt; sites at once.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right now we only want to scrape 1 =\r\nvery large site, and it is going very\n&gt; slow with the 1 thread/site used by=\r\n Heritrix. Is there any way to\nconfigure\n&gt; this, so that we can crawl this =\r\nsite faster by taking advantage of\nparallel\n&gt; crawls? We are only retrievin=\r\ng 2-5% of the URIs/sec that we were getting\n&gt; when scraping many sites at o=\r\nnce.\n\n\n\n"}}
