Most of that will be spent reading\n&gt; data that is not used and should be skippable.\n\nYes. Once the index is built, however, you will not need to build it\nagain, hopefully.\n\n&gt;  Did you in your test make sure the file wasn&#39;t in memory?\n[...]\n\nlibarc memory maps the contents of the arc files: it relies on the OS\nto page the file as necessary. I did this intentionally to avoid\nhaving to read the entire file, and to avoid the added complexity of\nmanaging multiple buffer reads while running the inflation code.\n\n&gt; The ARC format was particularly designed so that you did not ever have\n&gt; to go through all the files, you could just read the metadata lines and\n&gt; skip the bodies to make the index, then use the index to get the entries\n&gt; you want.  That&#39;s a not insignificant part of what makes it effective.\n\nIf you build a CDX file from the compressed contents, you have the\noffsets in the compressed file (V field) allowing you to decompress\nthe entry you are interested in.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, the proposed idea of having the metadata\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The more I thought about your idea on my drive into the office this\n&gt; &gt; morning, the more I like it. Keep the URL record uncompressed, and\n&gt; &gt; include a compression method and offset to the start of the next\n&gt; &gt; entry.\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;d lose the zmore/zless usability bit, though.  I&#39;m not sure which\n&gt; I&#39;d prefer.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t go into the middle of an uncompressed ARC file and easily\n&gt; &gt; find the headers either.\n&gt; \n&gt; /^http:&#92;/&#92;/[^ ]* [0-9]+&#92;.[0-9]+&#92;.[0-9]+&#92;.[0-9]+/ is nigh foolproof.  \n\nTouche, if your regexp engine allows forwards and backwards searches.\n\n&gt; &gt; It also depends on the tools. With libarc working with index-less\n&gt; &gt; files is trivial.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s also important that the tools be easy to reconstruct in the far\n&gt; future.\n\nOf course.\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
