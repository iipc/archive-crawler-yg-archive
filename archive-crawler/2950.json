That is why I decided to\n&gt; find a consultant.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this poin=\r\nt my questions are very broad. I would like to archive lists\n&gt; of websites =\r\nand then scan them for viruses/spyware/malware stuff.\n&gt; Anything found woul=\r\nd be added to a blacklist to be shared with various\n&gt; security based newsgr=\r\noups.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is also certain javascript code segments I want to find an=\r\nd when I\n&gt; do find them, I would like a list of those sites so I can invest=\r\nigate\n&gt; them further.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this possible with Heritrix? Is anyone doing =\r\nthis now? \n&gt; \n&gt; I read about how the University of Washington did their res=\r\nearch but it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t provide enough details on exactly how their system w=\r\nas\n&gt; setup/configured. I would like to do something like what they did/are\n=\r\n&gt; doing, but on an ongoing basis and actually provide lists to various\n&gt; se=\r\ncurity groups as well as using it myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this something the list c=\r\nan assist me with?
