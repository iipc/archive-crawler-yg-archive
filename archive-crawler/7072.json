(In contrast, NOINDEX/NOFOLLOW are documented, \nat least a little, via reports of a consensus discussion at \nrobotstxt.org. [1])\n\nI believe that &#39;NOARCHIVE&#39; was introduced by Google, and adoption by \nothers has been spotty.\n\nAnd, for Google, it does NOT mean &quot;don&#39;t store this info in any form&quot;. \nRather, it means, &quot;don&#39;t display a cached version of this page to the \npublic&quot;. [2] Google still retrieves and indexes the full contents of \n&#39;NOARCHIVE&#39; pages, and (in one sliced-and-diced form or another) has \nwhat amounts to an internal copy of the content.\n\nAs a result, if we are following Google&#39;s lead as the creator of this \n&#39;NOARCHIVE&#39; tag, we should make the tag automatically cause the material \nto be discarded at crawl time. Rather, the tag should be considered at \neither index-for-display or redisplay time, and prevent the sharing of \ncached material.\n\nIndeed, that&#39;s what we do for Heritrix: only consider the robots rules \nthat limit initial collection, leaving decisions on storage and access \nfor other software. Both the classic (closed-source) Wayback, and the \nnew open-source Wayback software, will usually observe a &#39;NOARCHIVE&#39; \ndirective inside HTML META tags during URL-indexing, as meaning a \ndocument should be left out of public display. (The content remains \nstored for other potential purposes.)\n\nIf an archive in an abundance of caution wanted to discard fetched \ncontent with a NOARCHIVE tag such that it is never even stored, that \nwould be a fairly easy option to add to Heritrix. I&#39;d be open to that as \na feature, but for the reasons above, we might not want that to be the \ndefault crawl-time behavior.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n[1] http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html ...and...\nhttp://www.robotstxt.org/metabof.html\n\n[2] See Google&#39;s help text at:\nhttp://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=79812\n\n\nOn 3/9/11 5:08 AM, tuxzone wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I just found a webpage in our archives that contains a robots metatag saying\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex,noarchive,nofollow&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The page was harvested using the classic robots policy.
