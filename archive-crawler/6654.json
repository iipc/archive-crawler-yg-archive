I would like a short explanation on\n&gt; the semantics of the fields present in this report :\n&gt;\n&gt; queue\n&gt; currentSize\n&gt; totalEnqueues\n&gt; sessionBalance\n&gt; lastCost (averageCost)\n&gt; lastDequeueTime\n&gt; wakeTime\n&gt; totalSpend/totalBudget\n&gt; errorCount\n&gt; lastPeekUri\n&gt; lastQueued\n&gt;\n&gt; Most of the fields have rather understandable names, but I&#39;d just like\n&gt; to make sure I do understand the exact semantics, the unit in which\n&gt; values are expressed etc. I was unable to find this information in the\n&gt; user guide or by searching online.\n\n\nHere&#39;s a quick rundown:\n\nqueue: the string name of the distinct queue within the frontier (also \nsometimes referred to as &#39;class key&#39;)\n\ncurrentSize: number of URIs currently in the queue\n\ntotalEnqueues: count of total times a URI has been enqueued to this \nqueue; a measure of the total number of URI instances ever put on this \nqueue. This can be a larger number than the unique URIs, as some URIs \n(most notably DNS/robots when refetched, but possibly other things \nforce-requeued under advanced usage) may be enqueued more than once\n\nsessionBalance: when using the &#39;budget/rotation&#39; functionality (a \nnon-zero URI cost policy), this is the running &#39;balance&#39; of a queue \nduring its current &#39;active&#39; session. This balance declines; when it hits \nzero, another queue (if any are waiting &#39;inactive&#39;) gets a chance to \nenter active crawling (as fast as politeness allows).\n\nlastCost (averageCost): the &#39;cost&#39; of the last URI charged against the \nqueue&#39;s budgets, and average of all such URIs. If using a cost policy \nthat makes some URIs more costly than others, this may indicate the \nqueue has reached more-costly URIs. (Such larger-cost URIs will be \ninserted later in the queue, accelerate the depletion of the session \nbalance, and accelerate progress towards the total queue budget, which \ncould send the queue into &#39;retirement&#39;. Thus higher-cost URIs mean a \nqueue over time gets less of the crawler&#39;s cycles.)\n\nlastDequeueTime: timestamp of when the last URI came off this queue for \nprocessing. May give an indication of how long a queue has been \nempty/inactive.\n\nwakeTime: if the queue is in any sort of politeness- or \nconnect-problem-&#39;snooze&#39; delay, this indicates when it will again be \neligible to offer URIs to waiting threads. (When it wakes, it gets in \nline -- so actual wait before next URI is tried may be longer depending \non the balance of threads and other active queues.)\n\ntotalSpend/totalBudget: The total of all URI costs charged against this \nqueue, and the totalBudget above which the queue will be retired (made \npermanently inactive unless its totalBudget is raised).\n\nerrorCount: the number of URIs from this queue that reached &#39;finished&#39; \nstatus with an error code (non-retryable errors, or exhausted retries, \nor other errors). When nonzero and rising there may be special problems \nwith the site(s) related to this queue.\n\nlastPeekUri: the last URI peeked/dequeued from the head of this queue\n\nlastEnqueue: the last URI enqueued to anywhere in this queue\n\nHope this helps!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
