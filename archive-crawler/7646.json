We are att=\r\nempting a large crawl using the Heritrix crawler (version 1.14.4). The fron=\r\ntier we are using is the bdbfrontier. We noticed that using this frontier, =\r\nthe crawler is constantly accessing the disk, performing small reads/writes=\r\n that \n a) are inefficient in terms of aggregated disk I/O  \n b) move the d=\r\nisk head a lot, which is not very healthy for the disk itself. In fact, we =\r\nhave already lost multiple disks in the process. \n\nIs there some way to avo=\r\nid this problem?\n\nThanks for the help\n\nMatteo Ceccarello,\nAlessandro Secco\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
