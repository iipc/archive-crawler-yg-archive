Anyway, I&#39;m trying=\r\n to\nreproduce the steps here.\n\n\n&gt; Is it that the form inputs differ by &#39;god=\r\n knows what&#39; every time you \n&gt; run?  Thats annoying.  So, how do you handle=\r\n it?  You notice \n&gt; failure-to-login in log, then change form inputs in UI?=\r\n  And then,\nafter \n&gt; changing the form inputs, you want to retry the page -=\r\n- but the page \n&gt; does not get retried because the page has already been cr=\r\nawled? \n&gt; \n&gt; Have you tried force fetching the URL? (Force fetching is avai=\r\nlable\nin a \n&gt; paused crawler.

But it might not because we keep the credenti=\r\nal \n&gt; state in the server object.  The old state may block the rerunning of=\r\n \n&gt; the credentials.  I haven&#39;t tried it (Otherwise, need to add to UI and =\r\n\n&gt; JMX a way to clear any stored server credentials).\n\n\nYep, the inputs are=\r\n different every time I run it. I just get\nredirected pages (302) if the lo=\r\ngin has failed.\nI&#39;ll try the force fetching then. I just got the inputs usi=\r\nng a\nHTMLparser on my WriterProcessor. Perhaps I could set them on-the-fly\n=\r\nand then do the force fetching right afterwards?\n\nSamuel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
