From the release n=\r\notes I understand it handles updation of mirrors by default. No need to cha=\r\nnge configuration like the 1.x.x release. \n\nI have mirrored a website by sp=\r\necifying its URL in a seeds.txt.\n\nFirst time it downloaded the entire websi=\r\nte.\n\nBut when I try to launch the job again it only checks for the main URL=\r\n. If it is not modified it says &quot;Finished&quot; then and there without checking =\r\nfor the remaining URL&#39;s which have been mirrored previously.\n\nIs this the d=\r\nesired behaviour of updation or is there any configuration which should be =\r\nused so that Heritrix checks for all the links which have been previously d=\r\nownloaded for modification.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nThanks,\nSriram=\r\n.\n\n\n"}}
