Now I understand why I have\nspent a few hours on the Heritrix user manual, but still fail in\nfinding that function.\n\nWe have been using GNU Wget which has the link-changing function, but\nWget always got trapped by those CGI redirection link! That&#39;s why we\nneed to make a change.\n\nI will definitely check out the HTTrack and hope it will work!\n\nOnce again, thank you so much for your valuable information!\n\nregards,\nAlan\nMay 11\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kristinn Sigurdsson&quot;\n&lt;kris@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Heritrix is based on the notion of accurately capturing websites (i.e.\n&gt; without any modifications of downloaded content). The functionality\nyou are\n&gt; asking for has not been included. It would probably be possible to\nwrite a\n&gt; processor for this, however I don&#39;t know of anyone working on that.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Might I suggest that you try HTTrack (http://www.httrack.com/)\ninstead of\n&gt; Heritrix. Unlike Heritrix, HTTrack is designed for mirroring\nwebsites, which\n&gt; includes rewriting those links. I think it might be more suitable to\nyour\n&gt; purposes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; - Kris\n\n\n\n\n"}}
