Testing this \non our main crawl machine shows that its fine. \n\nSo basically the re-direct page  from / to /admin/login.jsp \nobviously isn&#39;t pre-compiled (or whatever mechanism it uses).\n\nSorry this bug has been reported in dribs and drabs - I should&#39;ve \ninvestigated more thoughly. \n\ncheers \n\nmark \n\n**************************************************************************\n\nExperience the British Library online at www.bl.uk \n\nHelp the British Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
