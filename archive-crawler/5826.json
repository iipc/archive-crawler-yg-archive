I understand Heritrix=\r\n by default will persue all links it finds (including external ones).\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I am using Heritrix 2.0.0\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re just starting with Heritrix, w=\r\ne recommend using 1.14.3.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the default configuration, crawling wil=\r\nl generally stay on the \n&gt; sites defined by the seeds, but the crawler will=\r\n go offsite to get URLs \n&gt; that appear necessary to render on-site pages (s=\r\nuch as embedded images, \n&gt; scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This behavior comes=\r\n from the \n&gt; &#39;TransclusionDecideRule&#39; -- so removing that rule or setting i=\r\nts various \n&gt; &#39;*-hops&#39; limits to zero will prevent the offsite collection.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, if you do want necessary offsite resources, but fin=\r\nd \n&gt; Heritrix sometimes going too many hops off, you could reduce those \n&gt; =\r\nTransclusionDecideRule &#39;*-hops&#39; values without moving them to zero. \n&gt; Also=\r\n, Heritrix always considers links found in Javascript or Flash to be \n&gt; lik=\r\ne inline/embedded resources (because it can&#39;t tell the difference \n&gt; betwee=\r\nn those that load into the page, or only load on user navigation). \n&gt; So if=\r\n you find the only reason Heritrix is wandering offsite is such \n&gt; links, y=\r\nou could disable Javascript extraction (in the ExtractorHTML and \n&gt; Extract=\r\norJS) and Flash extraction (in ExtractorSWF).\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
