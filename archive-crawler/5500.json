I am using MirrorWriter and do not believe it\nis in that module =\r\nthat the stripping of the ? is happening as I do not\nhave entries under the=\r\n &#39;character-map:&#39; section. \n\nFor example: \nWhen Heritrix crawls the followi=\r\nng url: \nhttp://mysite.org/myfolder/myfile.cfm?pic\n\nIt is saving it in the =\r\nfile system as:\nmysite.org/myfolder/myfilepic.cfm\n*Here I don&#39;t know if the=\r\n original URL was:\n1)http://mysite.org/myfolder/myfile.cfm?pic\nOR\n2)http://=\r\nmysite.org/myfolder/my.cfm?filepic\n\nI would like to substitute something fo=\r\nr the question mark rather than\njust remove it, i.e. I did try using a \nmys=\r\nite.org/myfolder/myfile_SUB_pic.cfm\n\nThis way it would be easier to match f=\r\niles in the filesystem with the\nentries in the crawl.log as there would be =\r\nno ambiguity in where the\nquestion mark existed in the original URL. \n\nThan=\r\nks,\nMike\n\n\n"}}
