It has proven to work for \nmyself - but thats it.\n\nMaybe I&#39;ll work on a Heritrix 2 based implementation of this feature \nthat could have better inclusion into Heritrix codebase -  but atm I \ndon&#39;t have time to work on it.\n\nRegards\n   Olaf Freyer\n\nsusannanino schrieb:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; I&#39;ve a problem crawling a site written in .NET with a form that uses\n&gt; VIEWSTATE hidden field for postback action. So the same url is used\n&gt; for displaying the form and for displaying the results (after post\n&gt; back) that i&#39;m interested to crawl.\n&gt; I read the issue HER-1218 and I think it could be a solution.\n&gt; Where can I find the complete code, not the patch, of this issue\n&gt; implementation?\n&gt; Is there another chance to post a form with some values (also the\n&gt; default values) i.e. reposting the hidden VIEWSTATE and some other fields?\n&gt; Thanks in advance,\n&gt; Antonino\n&gt; \n\n"}}
