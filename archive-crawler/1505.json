My end goal is to send heritrix\n&gt; a job of say 10,000 domains to crawl, have it crawl for some finite\n&gt; period of time (x hours or x pages), and then stop the crawl, feed\n&gt; it another 10,000 pages and start again.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve read the Wiki for the JMX controls and have Heritrix up in\n&gt; jconsole right now (I know, not really command-line).  However I&#39;m\n&gt; not sure what to do from here.  I&#39;m happy to RTFM, but currently I\n&gt; can&#39;t find any info on things like scheduleSeed or scheduleFile. \n&gt; Can anyone help me figure this out, give me an example, or even just\n&gt; give me a URL and tell me to RTFM.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt; What do I need to do to auto-start a crawl with a predetermined set\n&gt; of parameters, somehow determine when it&#39;s done, rinse, repeat?\n\nThe jmx command-line interface is currently primitive.  You can see \nwhats allowed browsing jconsole.  You can only get global state and do \nglobal tasks such as pause and stop the crawler, or send it a seed or \nfile of seeds to crawl. The vocabulary you require, one that allows \nadding new jobs isn&#39;t there yet but it&#39;ll be there soon since its needed \nhere in house too.\n(Good on you for getting this far).\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Greg\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
