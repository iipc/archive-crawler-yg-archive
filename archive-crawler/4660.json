In order to crawl a finished URI you will have to \nre-fetch them. You can do that with the importUri JMX feature. In this \npost you can find an example of how to do so (it is the second part of \nthe post).\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/4589\n\n\nMore info on the our JMX client:\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/cmdline-jmxclient/\n\nHope this helps.\ni.\n\n\n&gt; I began a crawl with 10 or so seed items.\n&gt; I am using a surt_source_file for Decision: ACCEPT\n&gt; and another surt_source_file for Decision: REJECT\n&gt; \n&gt; For both SurtPrefixDecideRules the following are set \n&gt; seeds--as-surt-prefixes: FALSE\n&gt; also-check-via: FALSE\n&gt; rebuild-on-reconfig: TRUE\n&gt; \n&gt; I realized after the crawl had initiated by using the view the seed\n&gt; report that a couple of the seed items were being excluded by the\n&gt; &#39;REJECT&#39; SurtPrefixDecideRule - I had mistakenly entered in the same\n&gt; domain as a couple of the seed items.\n&gt; \n&gt; I paused the job, edited and removed the entries in the &#39;REJECT&#39;\n&gt; SurtPrefixDecideRule surt-source-file, clicked &#39;Finished&#39; on the job\n&gt; edit page, and resumed the crawl. I took another look at the seed\n&gt; report through the job page and the site still reports -5000. I forced\n&gt; generation of the crawl reports and viewed the seed-reports.txt file\n&gt; and the sites still report -5000.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there something I am doing wrong?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any help,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
