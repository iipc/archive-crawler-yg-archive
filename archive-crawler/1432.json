In\norder to explain why i need to do that in my case is\nthe following: The aim of our bachelor-project was to\ndevelop a web-application with which you can analyze\nweb-pages with the long term goal to achieve better\nrankings in common Web-search-Engines (Google,\nAltavista, Yahoo...) without having to use spammer\ntechniques (150 meta-tags...). The result of the\nproject (it&#39;s almost finished, just some things\nmissing e.g. user-agent) is that you are able to write\ncustom &quot;checks&quot; (e.g. you check the crawled pages for\nthe size, or you go through the first 100 words of the\npage and count the number of occurences of a\npre-defined word...), hook it up to the custom\nprocessor i developed and have the crawler check each\nURI against the desired checks for this crawl. (Btw.\nthe whole project is NOT designed for public use so in\nmy eyes it&#39;s ok to change the user-agent) \n--- Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi Christoph,\n&gt; \n&gt; I will just like to add on to the Stack&#39;s note.\n&gt; These days webmasters pay close attention to Web\n&gt; crawlers. If you pose to be googlebot it is most \n&gt; likely that IP addresses or entire IP range that you\n&gt; are using for crawling will be blocked from \n&gt; many sites. This will indefinitely prevent you from\n&gt; crawling these sites in future.\n&gt; On the other hand, there are many sites out there\n&gt; (a.k.a cloakers) that are trying to trick Google \n&gt; and other search-engine crawlers to get better\n&gt; ranking. In this case you will be crawling a lot \n&gt; &quot;junk&quot; that these cloakers server to popular\n&gt; crawlers...All in all, I strongly recommend not to\n&gt; pose \n&gt; as other popular crawlers since it will cause you\n&gt; more trouble than good. As Stack suggested you \n&gt; should work on creating good relationships with\n&gt; webmasters. Keep in mind that in crawling business \n&gt; it is easy to get bad reputation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take care,\n&gt; i.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi everybody!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I got two questions for you:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;First let&#39;s assume you want to crawl a web-page\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;you want heritrix to pretend to be one of the\n&gt; &quot;big&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;webspiders (GoogleBot e.g.). I know i can change\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;user-agent to something like &lt;user-agent&gt;(+&lt;url&gt;)\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt;&gt;is the usage of &quot;GoogleBot (+http://x.net)\n&gt; &lt;http://x.net%29&gt; enough to\n&gt; &gt;&gt;pretend that this is Googlebot??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Effectively, yes.  This &#39;user-agent&#39; string is\n&gt; usually how servers would \n&gt; &gt; distingush agents whether its adding special\n&gt; handling/defenses or when \n&gt; &gt; designating access rules in robots.txt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But note, we&#39;d strongly counsel against you posing\n&gt; as someone else&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; agent.  Because of misconfigurations or because\n&gt; you&#39;re not privvy to \n&gt; &gt; arrangements made between the target site and\n&gt; agent, there is the danger \n&gt; &gt; that you could blacken the  name of the robot\n&gt; you&#39;re posing as.  If the \n&gt; &gt; site only allows crawling by GoogleBot or some\n&gt; other agent, rather than \n&gt; &gt; pose as GoogleBot, try contacting the webmaster\n&gt; and ask that your \n&gt; &gt; crawler be allowed access.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Second if you take a look at the crawlorder-file\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt;can see something like that:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;newObject name=&quot;robots-honoring-policy&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;class=&quot;org.archive.crawler.datamodel.RobotsHonoringPolicy&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;      &lt;string name=&quot;type&quot;&gt;classic&lt;/string&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;      &lt;boolean name=&quot;masquerade&quot;&gt;false&lt;/boolean&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;      &lt;text name=&quot;custom-robots&quot;&gt;&lt;/text&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;      &lt;stringList name=&quot;user-agents&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;      &lt;/stringList&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    &lt;/newObject&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Can anybody explain me what the idea of this thing\n&gt; &gt;&gt;is??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take a look at &#39;6.5.1.4. Robots honoring policy&#39;\n&gt; in the user manual: \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#settings.\n&gt;  It makes \n&gt; &gt; a cut at explaining these fields.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good luck,\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Christoph\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           \n&gt; &gt;&gt;__________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Yahoo!
