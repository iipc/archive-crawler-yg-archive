The NutchWAX &#39;import&#39; command\nreads archived pages from (W)ARC files, producing a Nutch segment.  We\nsubvert the crawling features of Nutch and import the content directly.\n\n&gt; I am looking at some of the nutchwax code to see how to parse ARC\n&gt; records and pull out content.\n\nNutchWAX uses the &quot;commons&quot; library bundled with Heritrix, where the\ncode for (W)ARC file reading is found.  If you want just that piece, it\nmight be easier to get it from Heritrix rather than NutchWAX.\n\n\nAaron\n\n-- \nAaron Binns\nSenior Software Engineer, Web Group\nInternet Archive\naaron@...\n\n"}}
