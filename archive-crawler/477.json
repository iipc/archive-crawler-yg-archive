I&#39;m getting the feeling that this\n&gt;approach might me better/more efficient than simply writing a unique Perl\n&gt;script for each of the 100&#39;s of universities that i&#39;m considering. That\n&gt;said, i still have a few questions about setting up the app, and running a\n&gt;test. My primary issues would get into how complex the jave\ncode/environment\n&gt;would be.\n&gt;\n&gt;Never coded in Java. Plenty of C/C++/etc... but minimal java experience...\n&gt;But it might be worth climbing the learning curve if this might work.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nYou could do as Kris suggests and write plugins for Heritrix having it\nmake decisions on-the-fly about what to write to disk.  But I&#39;d advise\nthat learning java is a significant undertaking.\n\nI&#39;d suggest you begin by figuring heritrix, learning how to configure it\nto do a targetted crawl, and spend your time initially on the parsing of\nthe downloaded ARCs (Take a look at Tom&#39;s pretty libarc tool if c/c++ is\nwhat you&#39;re used to).  Taking this approach will help you better\ndetermine the mods you want to make to heritrix, if you need to make\nthem at all.\n\n&gt;Is there a phone number for you so I could have a short conversation\n&gt;regarding the Heritrix app??\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nWe don&#39;t do phone support usually (smile).  Put your questions up here\non the list.  Its better than phone support anyways (Witness the quality\nand variety of the responses you&#39;ve gotten to date).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;Bruce Douglas\n&gt;bedouglas@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: Kristinn Sigurdsson [mailto:kris@...]\n&gt;Sent: Friday, May 28, 2004 2:04 AM\n&gt;To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: RE: [archive-crawler] Heritrix - use...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;From: bruce [mailto:bedouglas@...]\n&gt;&gt;Sent: 28. ma� 2004 01:08\n&gt;&gt;To: &#39;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt;&gt;Subject: RE: [archive-crawler] Heritrix - use...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;hey...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;thanks for the response. my questions are pretty basic, so bear with me!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;1) is it possible to provide a list of domains/urls that the app can crawl\n&gt;&gt;through, thus creating a basic domain/pool of content. ie, is it possible\n&gt;&gt;for us to &quot;feed&quot; the urls of the various college registrar sites to the\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;app,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;and have it then return/save the information to an internal file, or\nseries\n&gt;&gt;of files.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2) is it possible to configure the app to only return pages from a given\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;url\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;that have certain information/tags/elements, or is that better handled by\n&gt;&gt;the parser/reader function?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;A custom module can be plugged into the processing chain that looks for\nthis\n&gt;type of information. But it would then also require a custom writer module\n&gt;to take advantage of the information.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;3) once we have the returned information, how difficult/easy is it to\n&gt;&gt;write/create a reader? if we are looking to parse multiple schools, would\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;it\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;make sense to write a separate reader for each school that would have been\n&gt;&gt;returned from the crawling app?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;It occurs to me that you _might_ be best off not using the standard ARC\n&gt;writer that comes with Heritrix. Rather implement your own writer that\n&gt;examines the content and makes informed decisions about what to write to\n&gt;disk. That writer could then write the files to disk any way you like. In\n&gt;fact you could have it simply extract what data you are interested in and\n&gt;only write that piece of information. For information about writing custom\n&gt;modules refer to the developers manual on our website. It and the user\n&gt;manual are quite comprehensive and should give you a clear idea of\n&gt;Heritrix&#39;s potential.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;4) are there reasonably well documented readers for us to review? it would\n&gt;&gt;help greatly to be able to run a crawling app, and then pass the reader\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;over\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;the returned information... this would allow a way to see how the overall\n&gt;&gt;apps actually function..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m unsure of the status of existing readers. But if you opt for the above\n&gt;idea you wouldn&#39;t need to bother with ARC files.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;another question...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;can the heritrix app be setup/configured to access sites that require a\n&gt;&gt;user/passwd in a manner similar to what i can do with a perl (LWP)\napp...??\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yes, credentials can be supplied for certain types of logins. This is\n&gt;covered in the user manual.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;thanks for your time/patience...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;No problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;Kristinn Sigur�sson\n&gt;Software Engineer\n&gt;National and University Library of Iceland\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;bruce\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
