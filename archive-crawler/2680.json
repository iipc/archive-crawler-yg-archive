Both surt and seed files can been mixture of both seeds and SURTs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;OK. This is good to know. The documentation, as I remember reading\n&gt;&gt;when I was creating my SURTs, didn&#39;t imply this. Overall a lot of\n&gt;&gt;knowledge about using SURTs is spread through to many\n&gt;&gt;documents/messages/wiki entries. The fact that I have to put a &#39;+&#39; in\n&gt;&gt;front of the surts in an external SURTs file is counter-intuitive to\n&gt;&gt;me.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree. Surts-source-file is counter-intuitive since the file name indicates that the file contains \n&gt; surt prefixes rather than a mixed source of different scope forms (e.g +http://archive.org or \n&gt; +archive.org). However, I think that we should keep &#39;+&#39; as an indicator that conversion to surt \n&gt; prefixes is applied. We should definitely make this clear in the user manual and UI.\n\nThis is a bit counterintuitive; the change was made post-1.4 (June 2005).\nBefore then, the surts-source-file was interpreted strictly as SURT prefixes,\nassuming the operator had already SURT-ified any URLs included.\n\nHowever, the &quot;implicit conversion&quot; being used for seed URLs elsewhere had\nproved useful, and indeed I think some operators had tried putting plain\nURLs in the surts-source-file and were confused when the same implied\nconversion wasn&#39;t occurring. So the decision was made to unify the syntax\nof the seeds and surts files. In both cases the same SURTs would result,\nwhereas in the seeds case plain URLs would also become seeds.\n\nPractically, this meant using SurtPrefixSet.importFromMixed() where\npreviously SurtPrefixSet.importFrom() had been used, and that lines\nthat were only the be interpreted as pure SURTs had to be prefixed with\na &#39;+&#39;.\n\nThis should get better documentation in the manual and web UI hints; I&#39;ve\nmade an RFE for such improvement:\n  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1436290&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
