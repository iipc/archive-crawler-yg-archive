 \n&gt;&gt; I think, the fix is pretty simple now, however.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the report... I can see the problem path, but am \n&gt; wondering how you&#39;ve triggered that path when my crawl tests have \n&gt; not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you describe your use in more detail, perhaps with a taller \n&gt; call-stack, so we can reproduce here (and in a test case)?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
