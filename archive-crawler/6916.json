The StatisticsTracker assumes you want reports (see how its \ncrawlEnded() method calls dumpReports()), and it&#39;s generally assumed a \nStatisticsTracker will be present.\n\nHowever, since that&#39;s handled by the public method \nStatisticsTracker.dumpReports(), simply creating your own subclass of \nStatisticsTracker that doesn&#39;t do anything there should do the trick.\n\nAnd further, a feature of the Spring configuration framework we&#39;re using \nis that you can even create new classes *in your configuration file(s)* \n-- sparing you the need to add an Java classes to your build. See:\n\nhttp://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/dynamic-language.html#dynamic-language-beans\n\nSo it shouldn&#39;t be hard to suppress reports in your crawls. We&#39;d also \nwelcome a patch that makes whether all reports are dumped, or the list \nof reports available or auto-dumped, crawl operator configurable through \ntoggles or a named list.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/15/10 7:17 PM, Zach Bailey wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Are there any configuration options available (either on the crawl\n&gt; controller or the frontier) to disable the report writing when a crawl\n&gt; finishes or is terminated?\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not using the generated reports for anything and it&#39;s keeping me\n&gt; from being able to quickly turn around and perform another crawl until\n&gt; the previous crawl is finished thrashing the disk by pulling info out of\n&gt; BDB.
