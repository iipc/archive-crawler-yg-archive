Looking, for example, at...\n\n    percentages-googlemercator.txt \n\n...the first line is...\n\nwww.match.com              676     266143      0.25%    -265467\n\nIf &quot;0.25%&quot; is the percentage of the Google hits that Mercator\ngot, then we would assume Mercator got 0.25% * 625 = 1.5625\npages???\n\nClearly, the percentage is the lower of the two numbers shown,\ndivided by the higher, without regard to whether the same\nURIs appear in both sets (union/intersection issues) or not.\n(I don&#39;t think his isn&#39;t a very useful percentage number,\nespecially because its sense inverts based on which set is\nlarger.)\n\nI can get the real number from the autosummary data:\n\nwww.match.com\n                        google   mercator    Intersection      Union\nURLs retrieved             676     266143              12     266807\nResponse codes:\n  code = 200               676     257088\n  code = 302                 0       8883\n  code = 503                 0        172\n\nIf only 12 URIs are in both sets, the percentage of Google\ntop hits that are in the mercator data is 12/676 or 1.78%.\n\nClearly, something funky with the way the Match.com site does\nthings may make its URIs unsuitable for easy source-to-source\ncomparisons. (It appears to be the query-string &#39;trackingid&#39;\nappended to most of their page URIs.)\n\nLooking at a less idiosyncratic site, the &quot;percentages&quot;\nreport says...\n\nwww.copyright.gov              1000       9690      10.32%      -8690\n\n...but looking at the autosummary data...\n\nwww.copyright.gov\n                        google   mercator    Intersection      Union\nURLs retrieved            1000       9690             970       9720\n\n... we see that Mercator actually got 970 out of 1000 of Google&#39;s\ntop hits, or 97%.\n\nI&#39;d like it if these more useful percentages were automatically\ncalculated in the autosummary reports. \n\nSpecifically, when comparing the two URI sets A and B, we already\ndisplay:\n\n   count(A), count(B), count(A-intersect-B), count(A-union-B)\n\nWe should add for convenience&#39;s sake:\n\n   percentage of A also in B:\n     count(A-intersect-B)/count(A)\n\n   percentage of B also in A: \n     count(A-intersect-B)/count(B)\n\n(When dealing with an artificially truncated set, like the\nGoogle top-X, one direction of these two won&#39;t be very useful.)\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
