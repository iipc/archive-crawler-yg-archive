In your decide rules (DecideRuleSequence), you will probabl=\r\ny want to include at least the following three rules:\n&gt; 1.

Use a rule such as OnDomainsDecideRule  or SurtPrefi=\r\nxedDecideRule  to accept the URIs from your desired domain set.\n&gt; 3. Use a =\r\nTransclusionDecideRule somewhere after the above two rules to allow inclusi=\r\non of embedded resources such as images.\n&gt; \n&gt; If that is not exactly what y=\r\nou are trying to do, and you need to provide further inclusion of images or=\r\n exclusion of certain embedded resources, you might do something with a Mat=\r\nchesFilePatternDecideRule to match URIs that are likely to be certain types=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lauren Ko\n&gt; Programmer\n&gt; UNT Libraries \n&gt; __________________________=\r\n______________\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com [archive-crawler@yah=\r\noogroups.com] on behalf of leff_42 [caron.clement@...]\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, Oc=\r\ntober 06, 2012 7:42 AM\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [ar=\r\nchive-crawler] Heritrix - Crawl only images from other websites\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi eve=\r\nryone !\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope i post this question in the good place..\n&gt; \n&gt; I trying =\r\nto use Heritrix in order to crawl a list of websites (seeds), but must not =\r\ngo out of the domain, except to gather images.
