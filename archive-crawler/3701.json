I&#39;ve implemented a=\r\n\nWriter processor called HDFSWriterProcessor to write content directly\ninto=\r\n the Hadoop Distributed Filesystem.  For those of you not familiar\nwith Had=\r\noop, it is an open source implementation of the Google File\nSystem and Map/=\r\nReduce system.  It stores files by breaking them into\nchunks and distributi=\r\nng n replicas of each chunk across different\nnodes.  It allows you to do hi=\r\ngh-speed distributed processing of your\ncrawled data reliably, using a larg=\r\ne cluster of machines.\n\nThe code is mostly isolated to new source files, bu=\r\nt I had to make a\ncouple of small changes to some of the existing interface=\r\ns.  If there\nis any interest, I&#39;m willing to offer it to the project.\n\n- Do=\r\nug Judd\n  www.zvents.com\n  doug@...\n\n\n\n\n"}}
