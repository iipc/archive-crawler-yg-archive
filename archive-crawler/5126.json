So you should \nadd at least a PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule at the end.\n\nStill, while your seed would then match the 2nd rule&#39;s regex (exactly), \nI don&#39;t see any outlinks on your seed page that have &#39;program&#39; in them. \nSo nothing else would be crawled.\n\nMaybe you want to crawl everything &#39;under&#39; (an extension of) \nhttp://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~sajib/ ? In which case make that second \nrule a SurtPrefixedDecideRule, with ACCEPT as the decision, and have it \nuse the seeds to get the initial acceptable prefixes.\n\nThat will get your seed, plus any other material it discovers at URLs \nstarting http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~sajib/ -- and any &#39;program&#39; URLs \nif you leave in your third rule.\n\nI highly recommend people designing their own scopes start with the \ndefault and craft it to add/remove other URLs, rather than build up from \nscratch.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I also tried with\n&gt;   Reject By Default org.archive.crawler.deciderules.RejectDecideRule\n&gt;   Accept If org.archive.crawler.deciderules.MatchesRegExpDecideRule \n&gt;                  [Here, I have added .*program.* as regular expression]\n&gt;   Accept If org.archive.crawler.deciderules.SeedAcceptDecideRule\n&gt; \n&gt; None of those seems to work. \n&gt; I thing if anyone suggests how to write the regular expression in \n&gt; Heritrix, that would be just great.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sajib\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
