I want to crawl a particular site and only \n&gt; the &quot;pages&quot; linked to it and not the entire linked sites.  I tried with \n&gt; Max-hop-filter 1 and 2.\n&gt; \n&gt; With 1 I end up crawling the seed site but nothing outside. With 2 its \n&gt; crawls all the pages of the linked sites. I guess I am doing something \n&gt; incorrectly, any guidance would be appreciated.\n\nIf I understand correctly, you want to crawl a site, plus any pages \nlinked-to from that site -- &quot;one hop off the target site&quot;.\n\nThe various max-hops settings generally count hops from your seeds, not \nhops from a site. There is a pending feature request (but with no target \ndate/release) for generally supporting a scope which is &#39;n hops off&#39; \nsome other more focused sub-scope:\n\n[ 1289245 ] n-hops-off decide rule / focus plus N hops scoping\nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1289245&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\nHowever, if using a scope based on SURT-centric DecideRules -- which \ninclude the (Not)SurtPrefixedDecideRule, (Not)OnDomainsDecideRule, \n(Not)OnHostsDecideRule -- there is another setting which acheives \nessentially &quot;1 hop off&quot; scope expansion: &#39;also-check-via&#39;.\n\nIf &#39;also-check-via&#39; is true, the SURT-based scope check will be tried \nagainst both an URL and its &#39;via&#39; (the URL from which is was \ndiscovered). If either is acceptable, the current URL is ruled in. The \neffect is generally to include anything discovered one hop away from the \nestablished SURT URL prefixes.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
