I know heritrix is not intended to be used as a library, but wo=\r\nuld using it as one be feasible?\n\nAs a proof of concept, I would like to ju=\r\nst write an app that you can point to a domain, and have it print out all t=\r\nhe URLs it can find in the domain.  I&#39;ve been digging through the code for =\r\na couple hours, and am still not really seeing how I would do something lik=\r\ne that.  Is heritrix useful as a web spider library, or should I just back =\r\naway slowly?\n\nHeritrix seems to contain many features that I would like to =\r\ntake advantage of later, so I really don&#39;t want to rewrite all this from sc=\r\nratch, however I also don&#39;t want to spend all my time trying to hammer a sq=\r\nuare peg into a round hole.\n\nCould anyone point me at some documentation th=\r\nat might be helpful for what I am trying to do (a good tutorial, or maybe j=\r\nust a tip at which classes I should be looking into in the javadoc)?  Maybe=\r\n some suggestions for an alternative?  Thanks for any help you could provid=\r\ne.\n\n   - DEAN\n\n\n"}}
