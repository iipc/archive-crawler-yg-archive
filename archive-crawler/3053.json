I used the \nQuotaE=\r\nnforcer to limit the number of urls from host to a certain \nvalues. Since I=\r\n set it as a prefetcher, the crawl.logs show a lot of -\n5003 status code. T=\r\nhat&#39;s fine! Now, can I use QuotaEnforcer in the post-\nprocessor stage (befo=\r\nre Scheduler) so that those url exceeding limits \nwon&#39;t even be scheduled? =\r\nThat will save time to my crawl.\n\nThanks\nBarabasy \n\n\n\n\n"}}
