I have a big collection of Ruby\nparsers, so I may end up usi=\r\nng JRuby to host them, if it would be\nsimple enough to send the fetched con=\r\ntent and request metadata to a\nmethod on one of my Ruby classes.\n\nIs this s=\r\nomething people are doing with Heritrix? Are there better\nalternatives I ma=\r\ny not have heard of? If I were to attempt patching\nsome JRuby calls into He=\r\nretrix, would I be better working from the 1.x\nbranch or 2.0?\n\nThanks for a=\r\nny feedback,\nChris\n\n\n"}}
