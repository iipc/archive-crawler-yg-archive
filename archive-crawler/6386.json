But now, we got a complaint of a webmaster \n&gt; claiming the contrary. I started a quick test crawl on a local server and \n&gt; I still find lines like\n&gt; \n&gt; 172.20.16.132 - - [15/Feb/2010:17:14:44 +0100] &quot;GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.0&quot; \n&gt; 404 274 &quot;http://...&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; ...)&quot; &quot;-&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; in the server&#39;s access.log.\n&gt; \n&gt; Did I miss something?\n\nHi, Bert.\n\nNo, we missed something. It appears the fix was only applied to H2/H3 \ncode branches, even though the H1 branch was also marked as &#39;fixed&#39;. \nI&#39;ve reopened the issue so it can be fixed for 1.14.4.\n\nThanks for catching this,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
