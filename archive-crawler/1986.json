I have my startup script written as \nrecommended\n&gt; &gt; with the proper classpath in the proper order. Everything seems \nto be\n&gt; &gt; in order except I always get the ServerCache error for any domain \nor\n&gt; &gt; ip address I try to crawl.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is ServerCache error?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The box is not running anything else and\n&gt; &gt; is not firewalled. (I thought for a moment that my firewall was\n&gt; &gt; giving Heritrix a hard time but that seems unlikely, I just \nwanted to\n&gt; &gt; get that out of the way before asking for help.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am counting on Heritrix to feed a knowledge refinery before the\n&gt; &gt; weekend. Perhaps there is an issue with my crawl order? Could \nsomeone\n&gt; &gt; post or send me a domain scope crawl order that is known to be\n&gt; &gt; working? I can fill in the seeds. The order I have uses no pre-\nfetch-\n&gt; &gt; processors, another post suggested eliminating this part of the \nchain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; This is probably your issue.  You&#39;ll need the Preselector and \n&gt; PreconditionEnforcer that are the usual occupants of the \n&gt; pre-fetch-processor step.\n&gt; \n&gt; Try using an order based off one of the profiles setting user-agent \nand \n&gt; from and supplying a couple of seeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to lend a hand developing, I like the architecture \nand\n&gt; &gt; plan to be using it for a few projects but I have to get some \ncrawls\n&gt; &gt; running first.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you in advance any help will be greatly appreciated,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Brian M.
