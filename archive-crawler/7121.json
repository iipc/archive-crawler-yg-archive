You can leave the crawler in the &#39;holding jobs&#39; state \n(don&#39;t hit &#39;start&#39; in the main console window), create your job, edit \nthe seeds.txt, and then tell the crawler to start crawling pending jobs.\n\nYou can also, on the initial &#39;create new job&#39; screen, hit one of the \nbuttons other than &#39;submit job&#39; to view the other configuration pages \n(other than the &#39;settings&#39; fields, which also includes the seeds.txt \ntextarea at the bottom). Manually edit the seeds.txt, and only then \n&#39;submit job&#39;.\n\n&gt; One more question, if I initiated a new job based on an old one that has\n&gt; a seeds.txt file, is the file going to be copied?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt; By the way, why there is not anything about this (using seeds.txt) in\n&gt; the manual. I think this is very important.\n\nIt should be, but the H1 User Manual has always been more of a guide to \ngetting started than a complete reference. Also, it hasn&#39;t received \nmajor updates in a long time – I think its info was most current around \nthe 1.8-1.10 timeframe, and I suspect editing large seed lists outside \nthe UI was considered a clunky expert trick at the time of its initial \nwriting.\n\nMore attention is now paid to the H3 User Manual. That lives on the \nproject wiki, in the hope that any user who notices an error or omission \ncan help fix them directly.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *From:* Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Cc:* Muath Alkhalaf &lt;moath2@...&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Wed, April 20, 2011 2:23:50 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [archive-crawler] How to specify a Seeds file for\n&gt; Heritrix 1.14\n&gt;\n&gt; Mohamed gave the right seeds answer for H3 – where you edit the\n&gt; &#39;crawler-beans.cxml&#39; file for your job, to pull seeds from a different\n&gt; place – but the situation is a little different in H1.14.\n&gt;\n&gt; In Heritrix 1.14, it&#39;s assumed there&#39;s a &#39;seeds.txt&#39; file in your job\n&gt; directory. You can find and edit this file directly on the filesystem\n&gt; before you start your crawl. (When it&#39;s over a certain manageable size,\n&gt; the web UI will no longer show the in-page editable textarea.)\n&gt;\n&gt; H3 is better at handling millions of seeds, but we&#39;ve done hundreds of\n&gt; thousands of seeds in H1 without problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding your other questions:\n&gt;\n&gt; (2)\n&gt;\n&gt; For postprocessing analysis that pulls together a bunch of related\n&gt; resources (such as a text/html page and all scripts it inlines), you&#39;ll\n&gt; want to create a master index of what&#39;s spread across your files, then\n&gt; use that index to guide you to individual resources. Our &#39;Wayback&#39;\n&gt; project for browser access does this, as part of its operation, so you\n&gt; may want to look at it for ideas and code that&#39;s applicable to your use.\n&gt;\n&gt; (3)\n&gt;\n&gt; There&#39;s no master reference; our general recommendation is to start with\n&gt; the bundled defaults and tinker incrementally.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many of the major alternative settings and components are discussed in\n&gt; the H1 user-manual\n&gt; (&lt;http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/index.html&gt;) or H3\n&gt; wiki user-manual\n&gt; (&lt;https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Heritrix+3.0+User+Guide&gt;).\n&gt;\n&gt; But others are discussed in other wiki pages, or old discussion threads,\n&gt; and to find and understand all the lesser-used options requires\n&gt; reviewing the Javadoc comments and raw source.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt; On 4/20/11 12:14 PM, Muath Alkhalaf wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; So is this file a global configuration file for Heritrix and if so where\n&gt;  &gt; can I find it and what will happen to the configuration from the web\n&gt;  &gt; interface?

I have a\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; seeds file with 100K URLs but I do not know how to provide it as input.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; In first you have to comment 2 beans and uncomment only one bean. The 2\n&gt;  &gt; beans you have to comment them are as follows:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The first one\n&gt;  &gt; ------------------\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;!--&lt;bean id=&quot;longerOverrides&quot;\n&gt; class=&quot;org.springframework.beans.factory.config.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;property name=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;props&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;prop key=&quot;seeds.textSource.value&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; # URLS HERE\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/prop&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/props&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/bean&gt; --&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The second one\n&gt;  &gt; ----------------------\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;!--&lt;bean id=&quot;seeds&quot; class=&quot;org.archive.modules.seeds.TextSeedModule&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;property name=&quot;textSource&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;bean class=&quot;org.archive.spring.ConfigString&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;value&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; # [see override above]\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/value&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;property name=&#39;sourceTagSeeds&#39; value=&#39;false&#39;/&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/bean&gt;--&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; After that you have to uncomment the following bean:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;bean id=&quot;seeds&quot; class=&quot;org.archive.modules.seeds.TextSeedModule&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;property name=&quot;textSource&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;bean class=&quot;org.archive.spring.ConfigFile&quot;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;property name=&quot;path&quot; value=&quot;seeds.txt&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;property name=&#39;sourceTagSeeds&#39; value=&#39;false&#39;/&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Note that: I put seeds.txt in the same directory of Heritrix. You can\n&gt;  &gt; put it under any directory as you want, but you have to write its path\n&gt;  &gt; in the value as shown above.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; 2- Here is the scenarion I want to use Heritrix for and I would like\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; to know if my assumptions are correct. I want to gather a data set\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; consisting of webpages that have:\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; a- HTML forms\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; b- Javascript processing forms data.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Then I will go offline and iterate over the ARC archive files that\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; result from my crawl using a java program. While iterating, I can\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; check each one of the files if it is of type html/text and if so check\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; if it contains an html form. If it does and the code that processes\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; the form is in a separate javascript file is there a way to extract\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; that file from the archives using for example its URL as an index or\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; do I have to download that file again?\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I can&#39;t give you the correct answer.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; 3- Is there a good reference with some example profiles with values\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; for the different configurations available along with description of\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; when to use each of these profiles (I mean based on the bandwidth\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; available to my machine and its processing power I can use these\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; reference examples to better decide different inputs).\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; You can look at this URL\n&gt;  &gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/6771. I hope\n&gt;  &gt; it helps you.\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; Thanks for your help\n&gt;  &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; \n\n"}}
