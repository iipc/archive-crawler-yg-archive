But it would then also=\r\n require a custom writer module\n&gt; to take advantage of the information.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;3) once we have the returned information, how difficult/easy is it t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt;write/create a reader? if we are looking to parse multiple schools, wo=\r\nuld\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt;make sense to write a separate reader for each school that woul=\r\nd have\n&gt; been\n&gt; &gt;returned from the crawling app?\n&gt; \n&gt; It occurs to me that =\r\nyou _might_ be best off not using the standard ARC\n&gt; writer that comes with=\r\n Heritrix. Rather implement your own writer that\n&gt; examines the content and=\r\n makes informed decisions about what to write to\n&gt; disk. That writer could =\r\nthen write the files to disk any way you like. In\n&gt; fact you could have it =\r\nsimply extract what data you are interested in and\n&gt; only write that piece =\r\nof information. For information about writing custom\n&gt; modules refer to the=\r\n developers manual on our website. It and the user\n&gt; manual are quite compr=\r\nehensive and should give you a clear idea of\n&gt; Heritrix&#39;s potential.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;4) are there reasonably well documented readers for us to review? it\n&gt; =\r\nwould\n&gt; &gt;help greatly to be able to run a crawling app, and then pass the r=\r\neader\n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt;the returned information... this would allow a way to see h=\r\now the overall\n&gt; &gt;apps actually function..\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m unsure of the status of=\r\n existing readers. But if you opt for the above\n&gt; idea you wouldn&#39;t need to=\r\n bother with ARC files.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;another question...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;can the heritrix a=\r\npp be setup/configured to access sites that require a\n&gt; &gt;user/passwd in a m=\r\nanner similar to what i can do with a perl (LWP)\n&gt; app...??\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, crede=\r\nntials can be supplied for certain types of logins.
