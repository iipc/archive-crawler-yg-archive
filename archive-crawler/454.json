If the URL is URL encoded then there isn&#39;t an issue: the\nURL will be encoded at the byte level, and all is fine.\n\nWe faced a similar problem to this when we worked with Lycos to move\ntheir systems to Asia: it was common for Japanese documents to include\nURLs that contains Japanese text in them in multiple encodings:\nsomeone authoring a page on Windows (which uses CP932, a Shift JIS\nvariant) might paste a URL or pathname from a Unix system (which is\nusing EUC-JP). If you weren&#39;t careful when extracting the URL then the\ncharacters would get munged and a subsequent crawl would fail.\n\nThe cure here was, in part, to URL encode every URL before doing any\nother character conversions on the original documents. Heritrix is not\ndoing this (character conversion), but it should be URL encoding the\nURLs if it isn&#39;t, IMHO.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
