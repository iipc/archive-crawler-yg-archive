I&#39;m not much familiar with cron objects. I ha=\r\nve installed heritrix 1.14.1 and I want to run a job automatically after it=\r\n finishes.\n\nIn this how to specify in the shell script when the state of th=\r\ne job is finish, start it again? How to write the statement of getting the =\r\nstate of the job in shell script?\n\nRegards\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;avinashnash&quot; &lt;avinashnash@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Your question =\r\nis not that much clear for me. Any ways I will try to\n&gt; help you as much as=\r\n i can. Actualy what you need is an automated crawl\n&gt; that you want to run =\r\nwith out UI , you want to run it from the\n&gt; background. My suggession will =\r\nbe do the procedure like this and see\n&gt; the result\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. start heritrix f=\r\nrom command line using command \n&gt;    (..path)/heritrix/bin heritrix --admin=\r\n=3Dletmein:letmein\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. start the Job\n&gt;    (..path)/heritrix/bin heritri=\r\nx (path of Order.xml)/order.xml\n&gt; \n&gt; By this way to can start crawling the =\r\ngiven URLs\n&gt; To do it on an automated basis try the following\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Creat=\r\ne a shell scrip which calls the start method\n&gt;    (..path)/heritrix/bin her=\r\nitrix (path of Order.xml)/order.xml\n&gt;    with your logic&#39;s like if the job =\r\nis completed like that\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Create a cronjob which you will be able to c=\r\nreate where you can set\n&gt; like run this shell script every 3 hours, every d=\r\nay,every hour  like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Add this cron job to like\n&gt;     type cron=\r\ntab -e\n&gt;     which will open a file\n&gt;     enter the cron job in that file\n&gt;=\r\n     save that file using keys  esc+shift+:  type wq and enter\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Add =\r\nthis cronjob to the supervisor in your OS\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
