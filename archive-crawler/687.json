This user-agent change\n&gt;    would let vanilla webservers assume Googlebot is more like a\n&gt;    regular user, while still allowing site owners to recognize that\n&gt;    Google is visiting and still providing clear contact info in case\n&gt;    of questions or issues.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (GoogleGuy post on http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/22408-3-10.htm)\n&gt; \n&gt; TIA,\n&gt; \n&gt;     -tree\n\n\n"}}
