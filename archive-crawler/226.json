I don&#39;t see any point in our having 3 labels for one repository state. Lets only use the heritrix-?.?.? label in the repository when making releases (whether dev or stable).  The updating (and committing) of our software version as maintained in config. files (project.xml) should be sufficent for making the &#39;pedigree&#39; of what it is that external users are running clear (I&#39;d also suggest no need of the &#39;cvs&#39; suffix for version numbers -- the &#39;odd&#39; numbering scheme should be signifier enough that current state is &#39;development&#39;).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; I can see dropping the 0_1_x, but the 0_3_0 serves a valuable purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; Namely, as soon as the release version 0_2_0 is done, but before\n&gt; another dev version number is assigned, there will be code changes,\n&gt; perhaps significant ones. Builds from that development would\n&gt; identify, misleadingly, as 0_2_0 until a dev version number is\n&gt; assigned.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I&#39;d like to assign that dev number immediately after a stable\n&gt; release, making it nearly impossible for anything fetched from\n&gt; CVS to give confusing version info.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sound OK?\n\nMichael has pointed out to me that we can &quot;assign the next dev number&quot;\nimmediately, by committing updates to project files reflecting the\nnew version number, without necessarily adding another version label.\n(The label, coming later, would then accurately capture a collection\nof changes.)\n\nI&#39;ve just committed a summary of our version numbering discussion\nto the developer guide in the main project: xdocs/developer.xml .\n\nHere&#39;s the text, please comment if anything seems wrong:\n========================================================================\n&lt;section name=&quot;Version and Release Numbering&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;Heritrix uses a version numbering scheme modelled after the one\n         used for Linux kernels. Versions are 3 numbers:\n     &lt;/p&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;[major].[minor/mode].[patchlevel]\n     &lt;/p&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;The major version number, currently at zero, increments upon\n         significant architectural changes or the achievement of\n         important milestones in capabilities. The minor/mode version\n         number increments as progress is made within a major version,\n         with the added constraint that all external releases have an\n         even minor/mode version number, and all internal/development\n         versions have an odd minor/mode version number.\n     &lt;/p&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;The patchlevel number increments for small sets of changes,\n         providing the most fine-grain timeline of software evolution.\n         Patchlevels increment regularly for internal/development(odd\n         minor level) work, but only increment for external\n         releases when an official update to the previous release\n         version has been tested and packaged.\n     &lt;/p&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;In the CVS HEAD, version numbers are applied as tags of the form\n         &quot;heritrix-#_#_#&quot;. When a particular development-version is\n         thought appropriate to become an external/&quot;stable&quot; release,\n         it is considered a &quot;Release Candidate&quot;. If testing confirms\n         it is suitable for release, it is assigned the next even\n         minor/mode value (and a zero patchlevel), CVS version-labelled,\n         and packaged for release. Immediately after release, and before\n         additional coding occurs, the CVS HEAD is assigned the next odd\n         minor/mode value (and a zero patchlevel) in project/source\n         files.\n     &lt;/p&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;If patches are required to a released version, before the next\n         release is ready, they are applied to a CVS branch from the\n         release version tag, tested, and released as the subsequent\n         patchlevel.\n     &lt;/p&gt;\n     &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that each version number is an integer, not merely\n         a decimal digit. To use an extreme example: development version\n         2.99.99 would be followed by either the 2.99.100 development\n         version patchlevel or the 2.100.0 release. (And after such a\n         release, the next development version would be 2.101.0.)\n     &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n========================================================================\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
