Then each request will immediately follow the one before,\nacquiring resources much faster than the default settings.\n\nThe assumption that we only want to make one outstanding request to a\nsingle server is deeply integrated into aspects of our design, so I\ncan&#39;t immediately think of a single, easy way to relax this assumption.\nIt would probably involve creating multiple instance of the Frontier&#39;s\n&#39;KeyedQueue&#39; per hostname, or assigning a KeyedQueue a &#39;parallelism&#39;\nvalue which keeps it in &#39;ready to supply URIs&#39; state whenever fewer\nthan the given number of URIs are in-progress.\n\nWe have considered relaxing the single-outstanding request policy\nfor servers which clearly have multiple IPs serving a single\nhostname -- in which case we would allow one outstanding request\nper IP -- or moving to HTTP/1.1 pipelined requests, which would\nremove the slow-start and teardown socket overheads of the one-\nrequest-per-connection approach. However, these optimizations have\nbeen put off to some post-1.0 release -- perhaps by the fall,\nwhen our focus will be on broader and web-wide crawls.\n\nPlease feel free to file an enhancement request via our Sourceforge\nproject so that your need is tracked, including any details about\nhow you&#39;d like this to be configurable.\n\n  - Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
