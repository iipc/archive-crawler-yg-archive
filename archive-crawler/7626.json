Where can I have more information about it? \n\n=3D&gt; 2: I=\r\n perceive that ARCFiles, like below, has a pattern but I have to be sure ab=\r\nout it. Is WARC-Target-URI the URI downloaded?

I&#39;m doing a research in a metric to estim=\r\nate the numbers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of URL of a domain. I have a problem to solve and you=\r\n think you can help me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  I want to make a complete graph of all=\r\n URL&#39;s collected but all I have from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crawl.log is the &quot;father&quot; of the=\r\n URL and the URL. This would be necessary but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have an misundertandi=\r\nng about one thing: If heritrix collect one URL,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suppose &quot;yahoo.com&quot; =\r\nfrom &quot;google.com&quot;. If the heritrix enter in &quot;amazon.com&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and found &quot;y=\r\nahoo.com&quot; again, in crawl.log will appear:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  - - - yahoo.com - g=\r\noogle.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  - - - yahoo.com - amazon.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  or only:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  - - - yahoo.com - google.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  So, the heritrix will ignor=\r\ne the found in &quot;amazon.com&quot; because it was already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; found in &quot;google.c=\r\nom&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Att.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Elverton.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =3D&gt; Gordon&#39;s answer:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You&#39;re correct, the crawl.log is not enough info to make a ful=\r\nl web\n&gt; &gt; &gt; graph... it only records the exact paths that led to a URI bein=\r\ng first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discovered. You&#39;d need to log more from the crawler before it=\r\n &#39;uniques&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the URIs for crawling purposes, or perform a post-crawl an=\r\nalysis on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; full link-containing content, to create the web graph.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Gordon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
