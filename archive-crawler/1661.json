I had thought there would always be an F+ line \n&gt; for any URL before it would show up in an Fe line -- basically, you \n&gt; discover and add a URL to the frontier before you ever emit/crawl it.  Am I \n&gt; misunderstanding this?\n&gt; \n&gt; I ask because the RecoveryLogMapper class I contributed recently makes the \n&gt; assumption noted above, so when it gets an Fe without a predecessory F+ \n&gt; line it throws an Exception to indicate that situation wasn&#39;t expeceted.\n\nHi, Mike.\n\nYour assumption was correct: there should always be an &#39;F+&#39; (add to Frontier)\nbefore an &#39;Fe&#39; (emit for crawl-try).\n\nCan you easily reproduce the case where there is an &#39;Fe&#39; with no preceding\n&#39;F+&#39;, or is it a rare occurence in large/long crawls?\n\nCan you excerpt out all the recovery-log lines pertaining the the URI in\nquestion, as well as any crawl.log lines for the same URI, to see if\nthat sheds any light on what&#39;s happening?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
