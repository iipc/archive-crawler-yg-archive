I&#39;ve written a wiki page describing our experiences, including \ndetailed installation and configuration instructions, as well as some \nrather more limited discussion of the actual results we were able to \nobtain using Umbra. I hope the page will be a useful resource to anybody \nelse thinking about adding Umbra-integration to their Heritrix 3 \nworkflows, and that it might even help to stimulate some Umbra \nuser-community action!\n\nhttps://sbforge.org/display/NAS/Experience+With+IA+Umbra\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nColin Rosenthal\nIT Developer\nState and University Library, Aarhus\n\n"}}
