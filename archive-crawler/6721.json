The more I read the more I realized that doing a change in the =\r\ncode directly might not be the smartest thing to do as it would require a h=\r\nuge set of changes, so I had an idea that I wanted to run by the group if p=\r\nossible.\n\nSince Heritrix so easily supports modules I am thinking that I wo=\r\nuld develop 2 new Frontiers that will do the distributed crawling.\n\nThe mas=\r\nter Frontier (the distributed crawling I am envisioning has a central maste=\r\nr) will pretty much do the same code done with the following exceptions:\n1-=\r\n A socket listener which will be able to dispatch new URIs to schedule, to =\r\nmark URIs as finished and to send out new URIs to be crawled when requested=\r\n\n\nThe slave Frontier (for each instance of Heritrix) will be the simplest f=\r\norm of a Frontier which will do the following:\n1- When requested for a next=\r\n URI it will get it send a request for the master for a new URI\n2- When a n=\r\new URI is discovered and should be scheduled it is sent to the master\n3- Wh=\r\nen a URI is finished the slave will inform the master of that state.\n\nMy id=\r\nea of the above is to keep the basic code of Heritrix unchanged and just al=\r\nlow the addition of distributed code through a new module. I would love inp=\r\nut on the above especially if you think it would not work for some reason o=\r\nr the other.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Mackram Raydan &lt;mackr=\r\nam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have recently been looking into whe=\r\nther or not we can have heritrix run in\n&gt; a distributed manner and had open=\r\ned a minor issue for it. Gordon was kind\n&gt; enough to point out the list her=\r\ne might be helpful. Also Noah was kind\n&gt; enough to point to the hcc project=\r\n which as I understand is in the alpha\n&gt; stage. I was considering porting h=\r\neritrixs to hadoop and would like the\n&gt; opinions of the group. My line of t=\r\nhought was to change the worker threads\n&gt; into map functions and then use r=\r\neduce to manage the URLs. Arguably one does\n&gt; not really need map/reduce fo=\r\nr this and could go more with the approach of\n&gt; the hcc project but honestl=\r\ny I am still going through heritrix code so, l\n&gt; would love the input from =\r\npeople on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and best regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Mackram Raydan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
