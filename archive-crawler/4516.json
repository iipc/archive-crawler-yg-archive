I have just started to use Heritrix 1.12.1\nand roughly succeeded in=\r\n simple crawls.\n\nNow I&#39;m switching to control the scope of my crawl finely.=\r\n\nI added some rules rejecting unwilling URIs in LinkScoper.\nIt causes java.=\r\nlang.ClassCastException in the processor &#39;Scheduler&#39;.\n\nI have not read sour=\r\nces but I am wondering that \nLinkScoper converts Links comming from link ex=\r\ntractors\nto CandidateURI which Scheduler needs.\n\nCould anyone tell me wheth=\r\ner rejecting URIs in LinkScoper \nis correct use or not ? If it is incorrect=\r\n, should I reject\nunwilling URIs in the Scheduler (Scheduler#decide-rules) =\r\n\nwhich comes just after LinkScoper module.\n\nThanks.\n\nTakashi SASAKI\n\n\n"}}
