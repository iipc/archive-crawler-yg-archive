I&#39;d imagine that we&#39;d add\n&gt; an option on command \n&gt; line that enabled the setup of the SSL listener that\n&gt; volunteered a \n&gt; self-signed cert on connection and that set up a\n&gt; redirection from \n&gt; insecure to secure if user tried to access the\n&gt; insecure admin pages.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Thanks,\n&gt; &gt;Yousef\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
