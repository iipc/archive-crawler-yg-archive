For example, the URL\nhttp://www.someserver.com/dir7/dir8/ might be accepted as in-scope if\nits discovered purely through embeds (speculative and non) and\nredirects.\n\nI turned on all the logging I could and heritrix_out.log is\ninteresting (see below).  It appears the same URL is ruled in-scope,\nthen out-of-scope.  I&#39;m now looking into DecidingScope, and thinking\nmaybe the ClassicScopes I was using had some implicit rule to allow\nthings from embeds even if they aren&#39;t in scope...is this the case?\nIf so, it should be documented a bit better and the log behavior in\nsuch a case is confusing.  Any ideas?
