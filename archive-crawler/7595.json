Can you recommend\n&gt;&gt; a strategy for doing this with the 5 instances we are running?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Do we need to run a separate crawler dedicated to this? If so, can you\n&gt;&gt; suggest a way to crawl out from the tweeted urls but when we get\n&gt;&gt; additional urls from the tweets, quickly change focus to these urls\n&gt;&gt; instead of the ones branching out. When adding urls as seeds, can you\n&gt;&gt; set a high priority to crawl those before the discovered urls? Do you\n&gt;&gt; recommend maybe setting up a specific crawl for these urls and then only\n&gt;&gt; crawl a few hopes from the seeds - injecting the urls from the tweets as\n&gt;&gt; seeds?\n&gt;\n&gt; Dedicating a special script or crawler to URIs that come from such a\n&gt; constrained source (Twitter feeds), or that need to be crawled in a\n&gt; special timeframe, or according to other special limits (fewer hops),\n&gt; could make sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; It would take some customization of the queueing-policy or &#39;precedence&#39;\n&gt; features of Heritrix to allow URIs added mid-crawl to be prioritized\n&gt; above those already discovered and queued. The most simple possible\n&gt; customization might be a UriPrecedencePolicy that takes all zero-hop\n&gt; URIs (which all seeds and most direct-fed URIs would be) and gives them\n&gt; a higher precedence (lower precedence number) than all other URIs.\n\n"}}
