And I wish heritrix can run a job repeatedly in a certain\n&gt; \n&gt; period. So I\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;can add some \n&gt;&gt;site into the seed, and create a job ,then tell heritrix run this job\n&gt;&gt;everyday,\n&gt;&gt;and heritrix can run it automatically and update only the changed\n&gt; \n&gt; pages of\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;the sites.\n&gt;&gt;  thanks all the developer for develop the great spider!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;ansi\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Right, as Mark said this isn’t present yet but is becoming a\n&gt; \n&gt; priority so\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;expect to see a lot of work done on this in the coming months.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;In fact I’ll be looking into doing continous repeating crawls that\n&gt; \n&gt; adapt to\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;change frequencies. With a little luck that will be available\n&gt; \n&gt; sometime this\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;fall. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I would therefor very much like to hear why you want this feature\n&gt; \n&gt; (what do\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;you hope to gain). Is it a matter of conserving disk space,\n&gt; \n&gt; bandwidht, being\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;polite to websites etc. Please be as verbose as you like. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Feedback on this issue from other members of the list is of course also\n&gt;&gt;welcome.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;- Kris\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;From: Williamson, Mark [mailto:Mark.Williamson@b...] \n&gt;&gt;Sent: 15. j�`?2004 10:40\n&gt;&gt;To: &#39;zhousp &#39;; &#39;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com &#39;\n&gt;&gt;Subject: RE: [archive-crawler] Does heritrix support recraw?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;this isn&#39;t supported at present.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;It was talked about at the Copenhagen workshop (see wiki\n&gt;&gt;for details).
