I have a crawl going that was started from 40 seeds using \n&gt; the HostScope. I left the defaults of max-link-hops set to 25, \n&gt; max-trans-hops set to 5 and max-path-depth set to 20. I configured it to \n&gt; log any URIs that it considers out of scope. I can see in the \n&gt; heritrix_out.log file that there are thousands of URIs that it is not \n&gt; crawling because they are outOfScope. But in the crawl job report I can see \n&gt; that is still crawling many hosts and retrieving files successfully from \n&gt; hosts that are not the same as the hosts in the seed list. Is this normal \n&gt; for the HostScope? Ideally I would like to be able to only retrieve files \n&gt; from the hosts in the seed list or maybe go one link &#39;out&#39; past the host.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW I&#39;m using heritrix 1.6.\n\nBy default, Heritrix will include URIs that appear necessary to fully render\nother URIs in the main scope -- such as embedded images, scripts, frames,\nand resources referred to inside Javascript code.\n\nThis is probably what you are seeing. A way to tell for sure is to look\nclosely at the lines in crawl.log about the off-host URIs that were\nincluded. After the URI itself will be a string of capital letters, such\nas &quot;LLE&quot; or &quot;LXXP&quot;. Each letter in this &#39;hops-path&#39; indicates the type of\none &#39;hop&#39; that led to this URL from a seed:\n\n  L regular link (eg &lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;)\n  E &#39;embed&#39; (eg &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;&quot;&gt; or &lt;FRAME SRC=&quot;&quot;&gt;)\n  R redirect/refresh\n  P prerequisite (robots or DNS)\n  X speculative -- best guess reference (URI-like strings found in Javascript)\n\nA string of E/R/P/X hops, shorter than max-trans-hops, at the end of the\nhops-path will cause otherwise out-of-scope URIs (such as off-host URIs) to\nbe included.\n\nYou can tighten the HostScope to never go off-host by setting &#39;max-trans-hops&#39;\nto 0.\n\nOther notes:\n\n- HostScope and its sibling scopes DomainScope and PathScope are rather\n   inefficient in their testing of URIs (performing a linear probe of\n   all allowed URI patterns). This doesn&#39;t matter much in small crawls\n   (up to a few hundred seeds/allowed hosts) but can be a noticeable\n   factor in larger (many thousand seeds/hosts) crawls.\n- HostScope and its siblings also limit your ability to mix domain\n   (http://*.example.com), host (http://example.com/*) and path\n   (http://example.com/topic/*) scopes in a single crawl.\n- SurtPrefixScope adds a little complexity but both improves the\n   efficiency and mixing-flexibility of scope definition -- it can do\n   everything HostScope/DomainScope/PathScope can do, and then some,\n   more efficiently.\n- For even finer-grained control, and sometimes greater efficiency,\n   a DecidingScope with a customizable sequence of DecideRules can be\n   used, though understanding/designing such scopes is harder.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
