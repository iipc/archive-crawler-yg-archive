I&#39;d like to increase the rate until either the client or =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; server&#39;s resources are maxed out. At 2 pages per seconds, both the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; client and the server have plenty of bandwidth & cpu to spare.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n So far I&#39;ve reduced the frontier&#39;s min-delay-ms to 0, but the rate\n&gt; &gt; onl=\r\ny changed slightly. I notice that only 2 of the 50 available\n&gt; &gt; threads ar=\r\ne active at any given time. Could this be the source of the\n&gt; &gt; rate limit?=\r\n If so, how can I increase the number of active threads?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Btw, I ow=\r\nn the targetted web server, so politeness is no concern.\n&gt; \n&gt; Delay is calc=\r\nulated as the time the last fetch took, times the \n&gt; &#39;delay-factor&#39;, but no=\r\n less than &#39;min-delay-ms&#39; nor more than \n&gt; &#39;max-delay-ms&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you shou=\r\nld also zero &#39;max-delay-ms&#39; or &#39;delay-factor&#39; (or both) \n&gt; to completely el=\r\niminate politeness delays.\n&gt; \n&gt; Heritrix will still only open one connectio=\r\nn to a single hostname \n&gt; at a time, but this may be fast enough for you. (=\r\nAn earlier \n&gt; frontier implementation had an option for processing multiple=\r\n URLs \n&gt; from a single queue/host at once, but the option was not carried \n=\r\n&gt; forward to the current recommended frontier implementation.
