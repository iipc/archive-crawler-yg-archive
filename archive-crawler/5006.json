As far as I understand\nunsing this rule in a DecidingScope will accept pages one hop away from my\noriginal scope. What exactly happens when I\n\n- use a SurtPrefixedDecideRule to accept all pages from SURTS expanded from my\nseedlist\n- set the also-check-via of this rule to &quot;true&quot;\n\nMy understanding so far is that setting &quot;also-check-via&quot; to true will expand the\nscope by one hop. Will using the ScopePlusOneDecideRule expand this by another\nhop or is this redundant?\n\nThe reason I&#39;m asking is this scenario. I&#39;d like to crawl all domains that are\nin my seedlist and in addition I would like to crawl all &quot;neighbouring&quot; domains,\nthat is, all domains connected by one link to the domains on the seedlist. I&#39;d\nlike to allow the crawler to get as many pages from this &quot;neighbouring&quot; domains\nas possible, but not to wander away to far from the seed-domains to restrict the\nfocus of the whole crawl. Is this possible using some clever combination of\nrules I haven&#39;t thought about yer?\n\nAny help appreciated,\n\nThanks,\n\nChristoph\n\n\n\n"}}
