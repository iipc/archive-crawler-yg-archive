Instead, our analysis and web-access \nall operate on the aggregate files, pulling ranges out (and serving them \nvia Wayback Machine installations) on the fly, using prebuilt indexes.\n\nThus we have no standard or recommended tool for doing this. Someone \nelse might.\n\nFor simple cases it should be a simple tool to write. Complications can \narise, though, because not all URL paths are trivially representable as \nfile-paths. If your ultimate hope is to use a web browser to view the \nfiles on disk, careful choice of conventions for mapping URLs to files \nis important, and the file contents may need rewriting as well to make \nURLs relative to the file&#39;s new home.\n\n(The externally-contributed MirrorWriterProcessor included in Heritrix \nis one attempt at writing web content directly to such filesystem \nhierarchies, though I don&#39;t have any experience with it, so I don&#39;t how \nwell it works in practice.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 2/11/11 4:45 AM, virginie wrote:\n&gt; Sorry, I rephrase my question.\n&gt; So, I unpacked my whole WARC-File and so I would like to write the result (issue of the Extractor) on my File system into a structured directory like for example\n&gt; www.edu/2010/1000/pdf/Dokument.pdf\n&gt; www.edu/2010/1001/pdf/Dokument.pdf\n&gt; www.edu/2010/1002/pdf/Dokument.pdf\n&gt; www.edu/2010/1003/pdf/Dokument.pdf\n&gt; please do you have any Idea?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;virginie&quot;&lt;mbakom@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;&gt; I unpacked the whole WARC-File and now I&#39;d like to write the Output in my file system.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;&gt; Virginie\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
