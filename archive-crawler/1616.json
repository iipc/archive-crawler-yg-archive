So, \nI did some research into the Server vs. Client VM per the \nsuggestion.  Turns out 1.5 will automatically use the server VM if \nthe machine has more than 2 GB of RAM or 2 CPU&#39;s.  \n\nAnyway, I tried launching HEAD with the &#39;-client&#39; option to force \nthe client VM, but the heritrix_out.log file kep saying I was using \nthe server VM.  However, a kill -3 command to the java process shows \nthe client VM in the log file.  So, after looking in the start \nscript, I see that you&#39;re just running a -version.  This will ALWAYS \nshow the server VM on a machine with the above configs. Maybe run \nthe -version command along with JAVA_OPTS?\n\nAlso, FYI, the new 64-bit JVM for AMD64 will not run in client \nmode.  I was hoping to use the new VM on my hardware to give \nheritrix a bit more RAM in the heap, but heritrix doesn&#39;t seem to \nplay well with the server JVM.  I&#39;ve tried this with the x86 JVM and \nthe 64-bit JVM with variuos heap sizes..\n\nThanks,\nGreg\n  \n\n\n\n\n"}}
