This rules i&#39;ve created seem to work in the sense that dupl=\r\nicate URIs are not downloaded. The problem I am having though is that in my=\r\n custom Archiver when i look at the URIs that are passed in they are not th=\r\ne canonicalized version of the URIs. Is there a way configure Heritrix to n=\r\not just use the canonicalized for when deciding whether or not to crawl a u=\r\nri, but actually use the canonicalized form when crawling?\n\nI can&#39;t seem to=\r\n find another place besides the uriUniqFilter that does this kind of canoni=\r\ncalization.\n\nI am using 2.0.2\n\nThanks,\n\nsteve\n\n\n"}}
