But the end\nis slow.\n\nIt often looks like there&#39;s one domain left and one thread fetches a\nsingle doc every now and then. When downloaded/discovered stays at 99%\nfor a day I usually terminate the job and think that a couple of docs\nremained somewhere on the way. \n\nBut then I wonder how much remains uncollected and what paths might\nhave opened up. For one job the rate has been 99% (16209/16241) over\n24 hours. I somehow think this means about 30 docs uncollected. But\n&#39;Crawl report&#39; page says\n\nURIs\nDiscovered: 16241\nQueued: -178 (queue size &lt;&gt; 30)\nFinished: Total 16419   Success 16209  Failed 159 Disregarded 51 \n\nIt would be nice to see all URIs waiting in queue before terminating\njobs. Frontier report shows some queues but only their top URIs?\n\n****\nI&#39;ve haven&#39;t been caught in loops lately, maybe because I&#39;ve added\nsome filters to profile. But it&#39;s sometimes hard to guess in advance\nwhat might cause a loop. Couldn&#39;t heritrix monitor itself =&gt; when one\ndomain starts to fill queues heritrix could move URIs from other\ndomains upwards and leave the possible loop causing URIs for a later\ntime?\n\nkk\n\n\n"}}
