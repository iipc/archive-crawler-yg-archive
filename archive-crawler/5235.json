However i \n&gt; have just written a custom WriterProcessor\n&gt; wherein in the initialTasks() i need to get the value for the \n&gt; &quot;max-toe-threads&quot; as set in the global sheet.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can access the default value but not the live value whichever way i \n&gt; try. The standard method of global.get() does not\n&gt; work since it requires an object instead of the class.\n&gt; \n&gt; It would be of great help if somebody can suggest me a method.\n\nMAX_TOE_THREADS is a setting on CrawlControllerImpl, so you&#39;d need an \ninstance of that to pass into:\n\n     context.get(controller, CrawlControllerImpl.MAX_TOE_THREADS);\n\nTo ensure your processor has such a reference, you should be able to use \nthe same technique as used by the RuntimeLimitEnforcer -- an \nautoreference to the CrawlControllerImpl as part of its own settings:\n\n     final public static Key&lt;CrawlControllerImpl&gt; CONTROLLER =\n         Key.makeAuto(CrawlControllerImpl.class);\n\n...then in initialTasks()...\n\n     CrawlControllerImpl c = curi.get(this, CONTROLLER);\n     int toes = context.get(c, CrawlControllerImpl.MAX_TOE_THREADS);\n\nI haven&#39;t tried this, but think it will do what you need.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
