How do I request a crawl stop in a processor (innerProcess())?\n&gt; \n&gt; I found the method requestCrawlStop() in the CrawlController but wasn&#39;t able to find out how I get to my CrawlController inside of a processor&#39;s innerProcess() method!?\n\nIf you&#39;re just starting to work with the Heritrix codebase, I recommend \nyou use the latest Heritrix 1.x version (the released code which is \nbest-documented and most-used). If you are forward-looking and \nadventurous, you could start with the pre-release Heritrix 3.x code.\n\nIn Heritrix 1, class Processor has a method getController() which will \ngive you the CrawlController. You can see an example of a use similar to \nyours in LowDiskPauseProcessor -- a processor that pauses the crawl. \n(LowDiskPauseProcessor uses a different mechanism in H2.x, and seems to \nbe doing something slightly wrong with the URI-in-progress when the \npause is triggered.)\n\n(In Heritrix 3, which uses the popular Spring framework to configure \ncrawls using the &#39;Inversion of Control&#39; style, if your processor bean as \nrequires a CrawlController instance at construction time, it will be \nautomatically supplied by the automatic &#39;wiring&#39;.)\n\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.) I have a list which I instantiate in the initialTasks() method of one of my processors and I would like to make sure that this list is only accessed by one toethread at a time (in the innerProcess() method of the referring processor of the toethread). How can I make sure that this list is only accessed by one toethread at a time?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not really solid in multhithreading and this is kinda new problem to me. I looked into wait() and notify() methods and some general stuff but couldn&#39;t really figure something for Heritrix so I would appreciate any help on this!\n\nThe most simple way to achieve this would be to mark your local override \nof the innerProcess() method be &#39;synchronized&#39;. Only one instance of \nyour Processor is created, and &#39;synchronized&#39; only allows one thread to \nenter any code which is &#39;synchronized&#39; on that Processor instance at a \ntime.\n\nIf you need a more sophisticated understanding of your options, you \nshould consult a general Java reference on these topics.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
