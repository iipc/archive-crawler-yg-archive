When this option is set to \ntrue all URIs are tagged with the seed that originated the path of \ndiscovery. See the 11th column of the crawl.log.\n\nAs Mike and Erik pointed out, the current approach would be to deal with \nthis in the post crawl. If you want Heritrix to aggregate URIs, then you \nwill have to write a new writer.\n\nHope this helps.\ni.\n\nmikej wrote:\n&gt; There is a hoppath.pl script provided with Heritrix (at least 1.10) in \n&gt; the bin dir. I have not used this but I believe it is supposed to do \n&gt; exactly what you are looking to do - track a url all the way back to the \n&gt; seed. I made a few modifications as the version provided would not \n&gt; escape out characters that caused trouble in the pattern matching. I \n&gt; have attached the my version. I have not completely tested it, but I \n&gt; believe it is working properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; On Jan 30, 2008 12:30 PM, Erik Hetzner &lt;erik.hetzner@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:erik.hetzner@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     At Wed, 30 Jan 2008 08:37:52 -0800,\n&gt;     &quot;Travis Jensen&quot; &lt;travis.jensen@...\n&gt;     &lt;mailto:travis.jensen@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I originally asked this question regarding 2.0RC1, but I didn&#39;t get\n&gt;      &gt; any response. Given the sparse docs for 2.0, I&#39;m backing up to 1.4.1\n&gt;      &gt; and asking the same question:\n&gt; \n&gt;     1.4.1? There are newer releases in the 1.x branch.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &gt; I&#39;ve got a set of seed URLs. Each of the URL has some other\n&gt;      &gt; meta-data (categorical) associated with it. What I want to do is\n&gt;      &gt; store each of the crawled URLs along with the meta-data associated\n&gt;      &gt; with the seed URL.\n&gt; \n&gt;     So the essence is that you want to track the discovery path of a URL\n&gt;     back to a seed, and associate arbitrary metadata with a crawl or with\n&gt;     every URL that was discovered by a certain seed?\n&gt; \n&gt;     Tracking discovery path back to a seed might be possible but I do not\n&gt;     think that it is currently implemented. Since Heritrix tracks the\n&gt;     discovery path from a seed to a URL I think it might not be that\n&gt;     difficult to track the seed itself.\n&gt; \n&gt;     As for storing metadata, Heritrix does not (as far as I know) concern\n&gt;     itself with any descriptive metadata about a crawl. This would either\n&gt;     need to be dealt with outside of Heritrix or added to Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt;      &gt; Is it possible to keep that meta-data with the seed URL as the\n&gt;      &gt; crawling progresses? Can I do it as a single job with many seeds or\n&gt;      &gt; do I have to plan on creating a single job per &quot;meta-data&quot;? Where do\n&gt;      &gt; I plug in to receive the content of the crawled page?\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; Any pointers are greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt;     What we do here at CDL is have one job per site, where sites have\n&gt;     descriptive metadata (outside of Heritrix) associated with them. This\n&gt;     is probably the easiest solution if you don&#39;t want to modify Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt;     best,\n&gt;     Erik Hetzner\n&gt; \n&gt;     ;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n&gt;     ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
