If a \nsite has a large number of hostnames that all resolve to the same \nmachine, that one machine may see a far-larger number of concurrent \nfetches. When we notice this happening, we add special settings for the \naffected domain(s) which slow the crawler.\n\n(2) By default, Heritrix tries any plausible relative-URI-like String \nfound in certain form elements and Javascript. This does not result in \nrapid requests, but can result in a lot of 404&#39;s as invalid URIs are \ntried against a site. Toggling some of the settings in ExtractorHTML and \nExtractorJS can stop Heritrix from trying these URIs -- eliminating many \n404s (at the cost of possibly missing some valid URIs).\n\nWith more specifics, I might be able to make more specific recommendations.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nnukleonrus wrote:\n&gt; We have left heritix2 crawling for a few days without any problem, but later, we got lots of emails which complained about making DoS attacks by us\n&gt; We used the default settings of heritrix2\n&gt; Could you please advice us, what to change, so we can be sure about no complaints from admins ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
