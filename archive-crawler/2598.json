I use\nthis strategy this because I have 10,000 seeds, so it&#39;s impossible to just\npaste them in the seeds window.\n\nHowever, whenever I start the job, heritrix completes it immediately,\nwithout processing anything. When I go looking for my seeds file, I find\nthat it is blank, or that it contains only the seed I manually entered via\nthe WUI interface.\n\nDoes anybody see what&#39;s wrong with my strategy, and/or could somebody\nsuggest what is the right way, in 1.6, to provide the seeds in a file,\nrather than via the WUI?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRegards,\n\nMarco\n\n-- \nMarco Baroni\nSSLMIT, University of Bologna\nhttp://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni\n\n"}}
