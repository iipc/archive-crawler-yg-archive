They can make (unsorted) cdx files from\n&gt;(uncompressed) arc files[1], do binary searches and get entries out of\n&gt;arc files, and write new arc files.  They&#39;re not optimized for huge\n&gt;collections like the Alexa tools are, for instance can&#39;t handle\n&gt;multi-file cdx files yet, but we use them internally with success. \n&gt;They&#39;re all under GPL, and improvements are welcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nGood stuff.  I just added a pointer to the developer documentation: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual.html#arcreader.\n\nThe same location pointed to above also talks about the ARCReader class \nthat is part of heritrix.  I just finished up some testing, profiling, \nand added a command-line interface and a wrapper script to make \nARCReader amenable.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;-Lars\n&gt;\n&gt;[1] Actually, they do support compressed arc files, except they can&#39;t\n&gt;figure out the length of the compressed entry, so they can&#39;t scan\n&gt;through them.  There&#39;s ways to do that, but I at least prefer to just\n&gt;not compress the files.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
