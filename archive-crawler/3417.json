Heritrix will only open one request to any one host at a time, \nand will pause between requests in accordance with the various &#39;delay&#39; \nsettings.\n\nWith 149 queues, that means there are only 149 target sites available \nwith URIs to crawl. Having more than 149 ToeThreads won&#39;t help.\n\nStill, only 3 URI/s seems low, unless either:\n(1) You are very bandwidth-constrained\n(2) The resources your are crawling are very large\n(3) Your target sites are unresponsive/unreachable, so most are waiting \nfor a connection-timeout most of the time\n\nThe threads report or crawl log might help distinguish among these, or \nsuggest what else is amiss. Even just the single line summary of thread \nstatuses (from the &#39;reports&#39; page) might help.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
