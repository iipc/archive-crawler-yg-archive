right now, we&#39;re just trying to actually talk to\nsomeone who understands the heritrix app to get a better understanding as to\nwhether or not it would be helpful for our goals.\n\nthanks for any help/assistance that you can provide.\n\nregards\n\nbruce douglas\nbedouglas@...\n(925) 866-2790\n\nps.\nessentially, we want to create an app that would be directed towards the\nregistrar sites of various university/college websites. the app would\nreturn/extract information from the websites to be stored in a database.\nbasically we&#39;re looking at class schedules.\n\nour initial understanding of heritrix is that we can &quot;feed&quot; it urls, and\nthat it will extract the page content for the various urls/sites. we would\nthen need to write a &quot;reader&quot; app that would parse the returned content for\nthe information for our purposes.\n\non the surface, this would appear to be a lot more efficient than creating\n100&#39;s of different perl scripts.\n\nthanks!\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Tom Emerson [mailto:Tree@...]\nSent: Friday, May 28, 2004 6:38 AM\nTo: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [archive-crawler] Heritrix - use...\n\n\nKristinn Sigurdsson writes:\n[...]\n&gt; Michael&#39;s suggestion of datamining the generated ARC files (compiled\nrunning\n&gt; an unmodified Heritrix) would get around the whole Java issue.\n\nI will be releasing an updated version of my (C++) libarc library that\nincludes an application called &quot;dumparc&quot; that allows you to dump\nindividual members from the ARC file based on the URL.\n\nYou can, of course, use the library directly to mine the file: this\nmay be the solution to the problem: you can mine the ARC files without\nmucking about extending Heritrix.\n\nSee http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libarc.\n\nWe&#39;re closing on a house today, so I&#39;m a bit distracted ;-).
