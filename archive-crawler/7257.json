At the slow-down time, the max heap is being used, congestion rati=\r\no high, and all threads active. \n&gt; \n&gt; Recently after trying to monitor craw=\r\nl progress using jvisualvm I the heap usage is generally steady rising and =\r\nfalling near the max heap. The thread activity shows most of the threads st=\r\nopped at &quot;Monitor.&quot; A thread dump shows messages like:\n&gt; &quot;ToeThread #159: h=\r\nttp://xqueso.tumblr.com/ask&quot; prio=3D4 tid=3D196954800 nid=3D0x1a50db000 wai=\r\nting for monitor entry [1a50da000]\n&gt;    java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on=\r\n object monitor)\n&gt; \tat org.archive.crawler.postprocessor.FrontierScheduler.=\r\ninnerProcess(FrontierScheduler.java:76)\n&gt; \t- waiting to lock &lt;111c81320&gt; (a=\r\n org.archive.crawler.postprocessor.FrontierScheduler)\n&gt; \tat org.archive.cra=\r\nwler.framework.Processor.process(Processor.java:109)\n&gt; \tat org.archive.craw=\r\nler.framework.ToeThread.processCrawlUri(ToeThread.java:306)\n&gt; \tat org.archi=\r\nve.crawler.framework.ToeThread.run(ToeThread.java:154)\n&gt; \n&gt;    Locked ownab=\r\nle synchronizers:\n&gt; \t- None\n&gt; \n&gt; It looks like the reason for the slow-down=\r\n is that most of the threads are blocked, with only some of them actually r=\r\nunning. \n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone have strategies for how to reduce this sort of th=\r\nread contention by changing settings? \n&gt; \n&gt; Lately I&#39;ve been trying to see =\r\nif changing the # of threads will help reduce it-I was originally using 160=\r\n as max-threads, and now I&#39;m testing 80, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be making a=\r\n significant difference, except in the latter case the maximum heap gets us=\r\ned up immediately within a few minutes, while in the former it takes about =\r\nan hour to reach max heap usage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, the point is I&#39;m a little stu=\r\nck and any insights or suggestions would be really appreciated!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
