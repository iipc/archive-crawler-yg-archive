I included the name in processor.opt=\r\nions and placed the\n&gt; &gt; .java file into the writer folder in the source. Th=\r\nen built heritrix\n&gt; &gt; using Maven. The new processor does show up on the we=\r\nbUI but the\n&gt; &gt; processor doesn&#39;t work correctly when I do a crawl. I get t=\r\noethread\n&gt; &gt; errors, am I doing this wrong? Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Without knowing th=\r\ne error, it&#39;s impossible to tell. If it&#39;s not \n&gt; something like &#39;class not =\r\nfound&#39;, and the crawl launched before the \n&gt; error occurred, it&#39;s probably =\r\na bug in your code.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\nI actually modified the code seen =\r\nin this article. I&#39;m not sure if its\nnot up to date with heritrix 1.14 or s=\r\nomething I changed. For the most\npart I just altered it to accept xml rathe=\r\nr than html and got rid of\nthe strip tag function and where it was used. \nh=\r\nttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/4538\n\n\n\n"}}
