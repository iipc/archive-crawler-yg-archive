Do you \nwant to follow all links? In that case, change the initial \nRejectDecideRule in your scope to an AcceptDecideRule. Do you want to \ncrawl links one hop off from the initial sites? Then you may want to try \nalsoCheckVia. Or are you trying to do something more complicated, like \ndns lookups for all offsite links, even if the links themselves are not \ncrawled? In that case you might need to write a custom extractor and \nperhaps custom scope rules as well.\n\nNoah\n\nOn 12/06/2011 06:57 AM, thomas.zeithaml wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; i want to crawl a domain with some external links.\n&gt; All external links are reported in the WARC Files.\n&gt;\n&gt; But some of these links don&#39;t get listet in the hosts.txt.\n&gt; There is also no DNS Lookup for these links\n&gt;\n&gt; Config:\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;ref bean=&quot;fetchDns&quot;/&gt;  is set\n&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;bean id=&quot;fetchDns&quot; class=&quot;org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchDNS&quot;&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;property name=&quot;acceptNonDnsResolves&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;property name=&quot;digestContent&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;property name=&quot;digestAlgorithm&quot; value=&quot;sha1&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;      &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; and also:\n&gt;\n&gt; alsoCheckVia = true\n&gt;\n&gt; Did somebody have some hints ?\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Tom\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
