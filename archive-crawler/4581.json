So I would rather change my seed\nlist to this:\n\nhtt=\r\np://www.site-a.ca\nhttp://www.site-b.ca\n\nBUT this now means I will now not g=\r\net the subdomains like\nsubdomain.site-a.ca.\n\nSo to fix this I figure I need=\r\n to change it to this:\n\nhttp://www.site-a.ca\nhttp://www.site-b.ca\n+site-a.c=\r\na\n+site-b.ca\n\nThis is pretty long winded especially with 1000s of seeds.  I=\r\ns there a\nbetter solution?  Is it possible somehow to have seeds with www a=\r\nt the\nstart but make it so the www is ignored when translating it to a SURT=\r\n\nform (without having to change to an OnDomains decide rule) ?  \n\nThanks!\n\n=\r\nAdam\n\n\n"}}
