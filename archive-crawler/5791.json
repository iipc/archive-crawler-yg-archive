I am also not sure that we don&#39;t \nbreak anything important editing web.xml. So please use my advice with care.\n\n\nRegards,\nSergey\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m trying to make some changes to the admin console, but I&#39;m not quite \n&gt; sure how to do it. I&#39;ve tried modifying the files inside \n&gt; webapps/admin.war, but when I restart Heritrix, none of my changes show up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Where should I be making the changes?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; \n\n"}}
