Example of these documents are embeds, speculative links (usually \njavascript), or redirects.\n\nIf you don&#39;t want any of transitive filters just set them to zero:\nmax-speculative-hops: 0\nmax-referral-hops: 0 \t\nmax-embed-hops: 0\n\nAdditional Scope focus allows you to specify what links (not type of links) are to be crawled.\nAs now this filter is set to match links&#39; suffixes (usually file extensions.)\n\n\nExample:\nSeed: http://a.com/\nScope: HostScope\nadditionalScopeFocus: .*&#92;.gif (crawl all gif images)\nTransitive filters turned off.\n\nAll urls from a.com are part of the scope therefore crawled:\nhttp://a.com/index.html (CRAWLED)\nhttp://a.com/a.gif (CRAWLED)\n....\n\nAll urls that end with &#39;.gif&#39; will be crawled:\nhttp://b.com/b.gif (CRAWLED)\nhttp://c.com/link-to-a-gif-image (NOTCRAWLED)\nhttp://b.com/b.jpg (NOTCRAWLED)\n\nAs you can see http://b.com/b.jpg and http://c.com/link-to-b.gif-from-c are not being crawled but \nthey are links to images (maybe &lt;img src=&quot;http://b.com/b.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img \nsrc=&quot;http://c.com/link-to-b.gif-from-c&quot;&gt;)\nNow, if you want to crawl these links you can set transitive embeds to 1 and they will be crawled \nbecause of their type.\n\nTake care.\ni.\n\n\n\n&gt; I am not sure I am exactly understanding the notion of scope.  Say I\n&gt; want to only crawl a specific Host that I have in my seed list.  I\n&gt; take it I should chose HostScope as my scope of choice.  I did that\n&gt; and ran a couple of tests, yet it seems the crawler still goes out of\n&gt; the Host scope to other sites.  Im not sure if it is a link hop issue\n&gt; that I am not understanding or if the host scope just isn&#39;t doing what\n&gt; I thought it would.
