(As \nyou seem to have discovered, though, this is easy to broaden to include \nother URIs, such as all .org URIs.)\n\nAnother consideration in the selection of seeds is that practically, \nwhen your time/storage for crawling is limited, sites discovered earlier \nwind up being crawled more deeply. So if good coverage of large, quality \nsites is important, having them discovered on day 1 of a one-week crawl \nis better than day 6. :)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nwp1740 wrote:\n&gt; Hey guys!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m new at the Heritrix so I apologize in advance if I&#39;ve missed \n&gt; something in the documentation but I have a dubt about DecideRule in \n&gt; Heritrix.\n&gt; I&#39;m testing Heritrix to crawl .org top level domains; using decide rules \n&gt; with a SURT I reject all uris that doen&#39;t uses this surt prefix, but..\n&gt; \n&gt; Can I use a regular expression as seed or I must introduce one seed like \n&gt; www.example.org &lt;http://www.example.org/&gt;?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you!\n&gt; WP\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
