Some sort of notification mechanism (or protected \n&gt; methods from where we can send notifications) would be of great help.\n&gt; \n&gt; We were trying to  figure out a way to reduce allreadySeen&#39;s  \n&gt; evergrowing size. And one of the approaches we are trying to explore is \n&gt; that when a queue gets exhausted we can delete all the URLs (of the \n&gt; exhausted workQueue)  and either add an entry for the  host (effectively \n&gt; host/*) or keep a separate exhausted queue.\n\nInteresting.\n\nIs the size on disk the concern, or the performance? If the latter,\nI don&#39;t know how much of a benefit marking the whole site as done\nwould offer, assuming you&#39;re using the default BdbFrontier.\n\nThe usual case is that the number of onsite links is much more than\ncross-site links, and the fingerprint algorithm is designed to make\nall the alreadySeen entries for a single host adjacent to each other.\nSo once a site is &#39;done&#39;, most of its alreadySeen entries should\nstay out of main memory -- only being accessed for the occasional\ncross-site link.\n\nStill, it&#39;d be worth a try, and might offer a larger benefit in\nsome broader crawl scenarios compared to more focused crawls.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n&gt; prasenjit\n&gt; \n&gt; gojomo@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Look for the call to clearHeld() in WorkQueueFrontier: that&#39;s the\n&gt;&gt;point where the queue is no longer actively &#39;held&#39; by the other\n&gt;&gt;queues-of-queues, because it&#39;s both empty and and its lingering\n&gt;&gt;politeness snooze has finished. That&#39;s equivalent to the state\n&gt;&gt;counted by the &#39;exhausted&#39; statistic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If this is an important extension point for you, we would consider\n&gt;&gt;(a patch?) making this step more prominent by factoring it out of\n&gt;&gt;the overgrown next() method.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Hope this helps,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;- Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Prasenjit Mukherjee wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Not via UI.
