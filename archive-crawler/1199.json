I did some work in focused crawling a year or so ago using\nMercator (one of the progenitors of Heretrix).  I think hooking in an\nanalyzer is a good idea; with my focused crawling I did all the\nanalysis of page contents on the fly as pages were being downloaded,\nrather than from files.  Doing on-the-fly analysis is actually a good\nidea; most processors have way too much CPU speed so you can do all\nthe matching you want, while your threads are politely downloading\nmore pages.  I didn&#39;t have any fancy machine learning analyzers,\nthough (but I wanted to move on to that); just strictly TF-IDF.\n\niVia is (in my opinion) the foremost group right now doing automated\nclassification based on web-crawling for technical subjects.  In fact,\nI was so impressed with their work that I gave up on my own, urging my\norganization to contract with iVia instead of having me repeat the work.\n\nIf you are interested in hooking up for a focused crawling project\nusing Heretrix, I am too!  Why don&#39;t you contact me offline (if you\nare interested) and see what we can cook up?\n\nD. Bergmark (retired from Cornell CS Department)\n\nP.S. Maybe we could implement the &quot;Focused Crawl Option&quot; you wrote about.\n\nP.P.S.  Probably no single option would work across the genres of\ntechnical, business, entertainment, ... I got really good focused\ncrawling results for topics in physics and mathematics, but really\nrotten results for topics in French International Law.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Saurabh Pathak&quot;\n&lt;sau_pathak@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \nHello, &gt; Hi everybody,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am new to this forum and to heritrix for that matter. I got to know\n&gt; a lot about heritrix after reading some of the mails here and am glad\n&gt; to see that people here are willing to help others.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have couple of questions and it would be wonderful if any of the\n&gt; Heritrix experts here can help me out. \n&gt; \n&gt; a. From what I have assimilated about Heritrix it seems that it does\n&gt; not have any option for doing a Focused crawl yet. Till now I was\n&gt; using iVia focused crawler but I want to know if I can do the same\n&gt; with Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; b. Is there any way I can hook up a classifier like Bow with Heritrix\n&gt; and hence run a simple focused crawl?  By running a focused crawl I\n&gt; mean (something of the sort of) taking into consideration the\n&gt; judgement of a trained classifier before adding any URL to Frontier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me know if anyone of you have used Heritrix to run a\n&gt; focused crawl and how you did it. \n&gt; \n&gt; thanks in advance,\n&gt; \n&gt; Saurabh\n\n\n\n\n"}}
