Looking at the frontier report w=\r\nill reveal \n&gt; which queue offered the URI, the count of other URIs in that =\r\nqueue, and \n&gt; other details. Looking at the threads report will reveal the =\r\nprocessor \n&gt; currently working on the in-process URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a single qu=\r\neue still holding URIs, and normal politeness settings, \n&gt; you would expect=\r\n on subsequent viewings of this summary to see the queue \n&gt; bouncing from &#39;=\r\nin-process&#39; to &#39;snoozed&#39; and back, until the queue is \n&gt; exhausted. If occa=\r\nsionally new URIs are discovered on other hosts, other \n&gt; queues might reen=\r\nter active crawling as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; On 12/26/10 10:00 AM, =\r\nyotpo.official wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I am running with 10 threads and 10 queues and th=\r\nis is my frontier summary after a while:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   RUN - 11 URI queues: 1 a=\r\nctive (1 in-process; 0 ready; 0 snoozed); 0 inactive; 0 ineligible; 0 retir=\r\ned; 10 exhausted\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anybody knows why is it happening?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank y=\r\nou very much\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Y=\r\nahoo!
