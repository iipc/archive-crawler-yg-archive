But this did\nnot even last for 1=\r\n hour. After that the download rate went down\nsignificantly and continued d=\r\necreasing during the rest of the crawl\n(2-3 weeks).\n\nDoes anyone of you hav=\r\ne a clue how this behaviour can be explained? We\ndid not have a similar beh=\r\naviour in previous crawls.\n\nThanks & best regards,\n\nNathalie Steinmetz\n\n\n"}}
