I&#39;ve been doing some more investigation and I&#39;m thinking of using\n&gt;another java scheduler (http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/) and I was\n&gt;thinking of setting up jobs in heritrix via the JMX interface.\n&gt;The only problem is that the JMX interface appears to be quite primitive\n&gt;in comparison to the web interface. :P\n&gt;Are there plans to improve the functionality of the JMX interface? If\n&gt;not.. How hard would it be to do it myself?\n&gt;\n&gt;Otherwise.. are there any other ways I can automate configuring/running\n&gt;jobs in heritrix?\n&gt;The web interface is very nice, but I need to be able to automate the\n&gt;process so that a real user isn&#39;t required.\n&gt;\n&gt;Any ideas? :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards,\n&gt;Dennis\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
