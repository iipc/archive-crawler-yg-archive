In case if not, the script looks =\r\nfor a  \n&gt; &#39;java&#39; executable in the search path (type &#39;which java&#39;). If both=\r\n  \n&gt; tests fail, the script exits saying &#39;Cannot find JAVA. Please set  \n&gt; =\r\nJAVA_HOME or your PATH&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I guess you either have a java installation=\r\n which doesn&#39;t work  \n&gt; correctly anymore or java has been incompletely dei=\r\nnstalled or  \n&gt; heritrix has a problem to run under the given environment o=\r\nf that  \n&gt; machine.
