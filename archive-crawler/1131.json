For example, suppose the file system\nis case-insensitive.  First http://acme.com/goodstuff/a.zip and\nthen http://acme.com/GoodStuff/a.zip is crawled.  This will result\nin the directories goodstuff and GoodStuff1, each containing an\na.zip file.  If the URIs were crawled in the opposite order, the\ndirectories GoodStuff and goodstuff1 would instead result.\n\n\n&gt; I think it might be possible to make a Javascript-based local-files\n&gt; Wayback Machine -- that loads the local file into a frame (or IFRAME),\n&gt; patches the inline resource URIs dynamically (like the public Wayback\n&gt; Machine), and captures any attempts to browse outside the frame,\n&gt; redirecting it back to the captured local files. If the\n&gt; Javascript and the captured files are both coming from the same local\n&gt; disks, it should be able to do all the necessary steps, without\n&gt; ever changing the files themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n\nIngenious.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
