Ho=\r\nwever I have noticed the default DecidingScope behaves \ndifferently than Do=\r\nmainScope (which is what I used to use before).  \nIt must be related to how=\r\n it is converting the seeds to SURT form. \n\nFor example, say I have this se=\r\ned list:\n---\nhttp://www.example.com\n---\n\nIf I then submit this with a Decid=\r\ningScope profile, the subdomains \n(e.g. subdomain.example.com) are not craw=\r\nled as well as things such \nas www2.example.com...\n\nBut I have noticed if I=\r\n change the seedlist to this:\n---\nhttp://example.com\n---\n\nThen it works and=\r\n subdomains as well wwwN.example.com get crawled.  \nHowever, some sites I a=\r\nm crawling will not be found unless the seed \nincludes the &quot;www&quot; at the sta=\r\nrt so this is not an ideal solution for \nme.\n\nHow can I achieve DomainScope=\r\n with DecidingScope without having to \nremove the www in the seeds?\n\nThanks=\r\n\nAdam\n\n\n\n"}}
