(Previously, subscription-requests were held for admin approval.)\n\nIf there are any concerns about this transition -- for example, concern\nthat project info that should not be made public is in the message or\nfile archives -- please let me know.\n\nWe are also considering moving project development discussion to a\ndifferent listserver, perhaps at Sourceforge. Possible benefits\nwould include:\n\n   (1) More familiar/open to walk-up open-source contributors\n   (2) Lower delays before messages are propagated to list\n       (We&#39;ve seen delays of several hours.)\n   (3) Less advertising\n\nHowever, the Sourceforge list service itself is currently going through\ngrowing pains, with the last couple of weeks of archives offline\nafter a hardware migration, so any move on our part will wait until their\nservices stabilize.\n\nComments on this potential move welcome.\n\n- Gordon @ IArchive\n\n"}}
