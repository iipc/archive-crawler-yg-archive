If you don&#39;t have resource to &#39;babysit&#39; these jobs so that you can make \ndecision on fly you should probably set some global limits such as:\n\n- max-time-sec -- maximum time duration of a crawl\n\n- max-bytes-download -- maximum bytes to download per crawl\n\n- max-document-download -- maximum documents to download per crawl\n\nIf you set some of these limits be aware that hitting crawler traps or &#39;junk&#39; pages may directly \neffect the quality of your crawls.\n\nTake care\ni.\n\nMichael Stack wrote:\n\n\n&gt; penguinoamante2 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;What are the best practices for submitting a batch of jobs.  I have a\n&gt;&gt;list of fqdn&#39;s in a database and I want heritrix to consider each one\n&gt;&gt;a seperate job.  The plan so far is to write a script to populate the\n&gt;&gt;jobs directory with the right info.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Is this the right way to do it?\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Make sure the crawler is the &#39;Crawling state&#39; so that it&#39;ll just start \n&gt; the next job soon as its finished the current job.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;Sunny\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
