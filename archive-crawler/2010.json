These are Domain scoped and currently focus on HTML only. I \n&gt; am writing mirrors of the domains. I have another application which \n&gt; is charged with archiving the mirror(when the crawl job is finished) \n&gt; and moving it to another system for knowledge extraction, taxonomic \n&gt; classification and ontology manifestation.I am just looking for \n&gt; someone to point me in the rite direction. I would like to have \n&gt; Heritrix add a line to a text file to signify the job is complete and \n&gt; ready for archiving, transportation, and digestion by another \n&gt; application.\n&gt; \n&gt; I assume I should just be able to extend whatever class handles the \n&gt; end crawl job cleanup to accomplish the above without messing any \n&gt; internals up. I am trying to keep the Crawler completley independant \n&gt; from other components other than gathering the output in file format.\n\n1. What about trailing the progress-statistics.log looking for the\n&#39;CRAWL ENDED - Finished&#39; entry.\n2. You could subclass CrawlJobHandler, as the selftest does, just so\nyou can catch the CrawlEnded event (See here,\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#769,\nfor where we set up and start the selftest using the selftest subclass\nof CrawlJobHandler.  See\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/selftest/SelfTestCrawlJobHandler.html\nfor a subclass of CrawlJobHandler whose only purpose is acting on the\nCrawlEnded event -- its where we do the selftest analysis).\n3. You could poll Heritrix using jmx asking it on a period if its\nfinished (To connect to Heritrix, use the jdk1.5.0 jconsole or see\nhere, http://crawler.archive.org/faq.html#cmdlinecontrol, for a basic\ncommand-line jmx client).\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On a side note I have herd a rumor that only one instance of Heritrix \n&gt; can be run per server. Is this true. It sounds like I could isolate \n&gt; two instances fairly easily. Is the issue with the IP, IE: can only \n&gt; one instance of Heritrix run on one IP?\n\nI don&#39;t know of any reason why you can&#39;t run two instances on the one\nbox. I&#39;d be interested if there is an issue.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way the last help I got from this list was great! \n\nFlattery will get you far (smile).\n\n\n&gt; I am also \n&gt; still interested in helping with development. I may soon have a R&D \n&gt; department that will most likely be focusing some energy on\nHeritrix. Personally, I am a friend of open souce so mabey we can get\nsome \n&gt; comercial bucks into the OS process and make everyone smile.\n&gt; \nGood stuff (Bring it on).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
