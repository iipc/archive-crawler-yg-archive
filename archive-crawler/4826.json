I think most of these urls are fixed after being\npublish=\r\ned\n&gt; on the internet,but a few of them will be changed. These changes usual=\r\nly\n&gt; will produce some new urls that we don&#39;t have at present. The\nproblem =\r\nis how\n&gt; can I find these few urls to be changed?\n\nThat&#39;s the nature of the=\r\n internet. URLs are always changing, deleting,\nor being created.\n\nI&#39;d need =\r\nto know more about why your crawling, what your looking for,\nand how you wa=\r\nnt to find it.\n\n&gt; 2. There is a huge number of data produced by the crawler=\r\n. How can i\nstore\n&gt; these huge number of data? Now i have been using a data=\r\nbase, which just\n&gt; helps me to crawl a few data.\n\nWhat are you storing in y=\r\nour database? Are you storing visited URLs,\nand if so. Why?\n\nI assume you w=\r\nant to prevent crawling URls that have already been\nvisited, and if you sto=\r\nre every visited URL in a database, then that\ndatabase is going to be huge.=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
