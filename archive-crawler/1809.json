Lets revisit when unit test classes are \n&gt; above 30% or just before a scheduled spate of rabid unit test class \n&gt; additions.\n\nFor the record, at least some IDEs allow you to jump back and forth\nbetween tested class and test class.  IntelliJ has a plugin that allows\nthat.  In our project, unit tests are in their own directory, but then\nwe&#39;ve been strict with having unit tests right from the start.\n\n-Lars\n\n\n"}}
