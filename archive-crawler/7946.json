It is a complex\n&gt; subject and therefore quite difficult for me to explain it in English.\n&gt; So I&#39;ll try again:\n&gt;\n&gt; The source code of the mentioned websites (i.e. the html code) points in\n&gt; one area to a CSS file, in which the instructions regarding the layout\n&gt; are lying. This path is “.../web/detail.php?template=hp3_style” However,\n&gt; the CSS file is not really there, but lies behind the path\n&gt; “.../sixcms/detail.php?template=hp3_style”. In between these two paths\n&gt; there is a redirect (HTTP 302) inserted. To show the page in the correct\n&gt; layout, Heritrix or rather the Wayback-Machine has to pass through the\n&gt; redirect.\n&gt; Now I detected that if I change the source code of the archived website\n&gt; to right path (which means, I bypass the redirect) and open the website,\n&gt; it is shown in the right way. If I open the unchanged archived website\n&gt; (in which the redirect has to be used), the layout is shown incorrectly.\n&gt; But the CSS file had been clearly crawled, because I can open the file\n&gt; via the Wayback Machine (entering the path which redirects to the other\n&gt; path) and then the  redirect is working and I see the right data file.\n&gt; Hope I explained it a little bit clearer.\n&gt; Thank you very much for your help\n&gt;\n&gt; Steph\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Von:* Noah Levitt &lt;nlevitt@...&gt;\n&gt; *An:* archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *CC:* Steph &lt;sherlock.h221b@...&gt;\n&gt; *Gesendet:* 19:53 Donnerstag, 31.Januar 2013\n&gt; *Betreff:* Re: [archive-crawler] Problem with CSS\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; What exactly is heritrix not getting right automatically?\n&gt;\n&gt; Noah\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2013-01-31 06:26 , Steph wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hello, me again!\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Sorry for spamming, this will surely be the last mail for today.\n&gt; Promise! :)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The problem is now pinned down.

This morning I experimentally undid the rewritings of the urls\n&gt; in my archived page. And was surprised to see it work smoothly. I found\n&gt; out that the problem seems to lie in the css files or the rewriting of\n&gt; the links to the css files. When I undo these rewrites the site comes up\n&gt; perfectly. But I think this isn&#39;t the best solution as I still rely on\n&gt; the css files on the liveweb and not on my archived sites and files.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Maybe this helps to get a little further?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Steph\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt;  &gt; *Von:* Steph sherlock.h221b@...\n&gt; &lt;mailto:sherlock.h221b%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; *An:* Noah Levitt nlevitt@...\n&gt; &lt;mailto:nlevitt%40archive.org&gt;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &lt;mailto:archive-crawler%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&quot;\n&gt; archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com &lt;mailto:archive-crawler%40yahoogroups.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; *Gesendet:* 9:44 Donnerstag, 31.Januar 2013\n&gt;  &gt; *Betreff:* Re: [archive-crawler] Problem with CSS\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hello Noah!\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks for your reply!\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Yes, I use Wayback Machine Beta for replaying it.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Like you said, I did a check for broken links this morning (using\n&gt; Xenu link sleuth) and now I&#39;m really confused. Due to the tests I did I\n&gt; got several archived versions of the said website. In some cases Xenu\n&gt; says everything is alright, in other cases he reports an issue\n&gt; concerning a file named index.jsp because of server error (500) or (in\n&gt; other cases) page not found (404).\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I tried to find the jsp file to take a look at it, but it won&#39;t show\n&gt; up anywhere. Neither in the live web version nor in my archived\n&gt; version...

Browsers these days have a way to\n&gt; view all the requests and responses as they go by (web console/net in\n&gt; firefox, developer tools/network in chrome, etc.) Open your url in\n&gt; wayback and look for 404s or other anomalies. When you see something is\n&gt; missing then you can try to figure out why. If you don&#39;t see anything\n&gt; missing at least you&#39;ve narrowed it down and can continue investigating\n&gt; elsewhere.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Noah\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; On 2013-01-30 02:14 , Steph wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Hi everyone!\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;m new to this group and new to web archiving.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;m studying Media Preservation and for a project I try to save a\n&gt; few websites using Heritrix.
