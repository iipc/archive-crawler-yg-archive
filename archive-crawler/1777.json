The original rationale for putting tests beside the classes \ntested was to avoid having to look in two places for code and as a \nconstant in-the-developers&#39;-face reminder that tests need to be written.\n\nRecently Christian Kohlschï¿½tter proposed Heritrix do as other projects \ndo and move unit tests to their own directory.  In the main Christian \nargues a src tree polluted by tests is tough to grok and that as tests \nproliferate and become more involved -- if we start adding mock objects \nand test data -- apprehension of Heritrix workings will get harder with \ntime.  His argument in full can be viewed here: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1187976&group_id=73833&atid=539102.\n\nWhat do others think?\n\n(How about an apache-like +1 if you agree that tests should be moved, -1 \nif you disagree, and 0 if neutral.  Let majority carry the motion, \nunless a minority puts up a good fight).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
