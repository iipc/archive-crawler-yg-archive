I have had a trawl through the message-base and \n&gt; oddly I can&#39;t see anyone having this same problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; I startup and everything seems ok:\n&gt; \n&gt; 00:58:30.468 EVENT  Starting Jetty/4.2.23\n&gt; 00:58:30.734 EVENT  Started WebApplicationContext[/,Heritrix Console]\n&gt; 00:58:30.890 EVENT  Started SocketListener on 0.0.0.0:8080\n&gt; 00:58:30.890 EVENT  Started org.mortbay.jetty.Server@f84386\n&gt; Heritrix version: 1.4.0\n&gt; \n&gt; I then go to :\n&gt; http://localhost:8080/admin\n&gt; \n&gt; and I get:\n&gt; \n&gt; HTTP ERROR: 404 Not Found\n&gt; \n&gt; RequestURI=/admin\n&gt; \n&gt; Powered by Jetty://\n&gt; \n&gt; so jetty seems to be working just enough to get me an error message.\n&gt; \n&gt; I truth is I don&#39;t even think I need the webui. \n&gt; \n&gt; All I want to do is crawl starting from x, and note any xml files. \n&gt; But can&#39;t seem to find the Command line options for doing this either.\n&gt; \n&gt; any help would be grand.\n&gt; \n&gt; take care\n&gt; \n&gt; kent\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
