Anyway, thank you for the tip, \n&gt; I found where the problem is: Basically Writer processor that I wrote as \n&gt; a test goes into an infinite loop with 0.01 probability (I wrote that to \n&gt; test the effects of a writer  that tries talking to an Indexer that has \n&gt; crashed).\n\nHappy to hear you found the problem.\n\n&gt; It would be nice is to be able to pause the crawl job from within a \n&gt; Writer. CrawlJobHandler has the pauseJob() method. Is there a way for a \n&gt; processor to access the CrawlJobHandler?\n\nTake a look at the LowDiskPauseProcessor for an example -- modules \ninside &quot;the crawl&quot; should send such requests through the \nCrawlController. (The CrawlJobHandler is an operator-UI-related class \nthat shouldn&#39;t be of interest to crawl implementation classes.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
