What&#39;s happening with, for example, the \n&gt; euro character (€) on a windows-1252 encoded page (0x80) is that when \n&gt; you cast it to char it takes the numeric value as a unicode codepoint. \n&gt; 0x80 is a control character in unicode. The correct conversion would be \n&gt; to 0x20ac, which can be obtained with new String(byte[] {0x80}, \n&gt; &quot;windows-1252&quot;), or maybe more efficiently with a CharsetDecoder.\n\nI think there are two problems: not considering the encoding in use, and \nfurther masking the return value to 8 bits, when a char would normally \ninclude values outside an 8-bit range. Either alone is enough so that \nByteReplayCharSequence.charAt() will give a wrong result for certain \ncharacters.\n\nYes, the fix is to apply the appropriate charset decoding to the bytes, \nand completely eliminate the masking on that result.\n\nHowever, we&#39;re unlikely to want to do the decoding a byte at a time in \ncharAt() -- the Java decoders, even for single-byte encodings, don&#39;t \noffer operations on single bytes, only ByteBuffers into CharBuffers. So \nsome other refactoring to do decoding in larger batches will likely be \nworthwhile.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon Mohr wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Jean-Noël Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; My problem was that I had a page that was actually encoded in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; windows-1252 cp, but advertised itself as a ISO-8859-1 page (although\n&gt;&gt;&gt; it did this only in the HTML content of the page, not on the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; appropriate place - the HTTP headers, but anyway as you pointed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Heritrix probably picked ISO-8859-1 as default).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt; Was there any hint or declaration that windows-1252 was the proper \n&gt;&gt; encoding, or would it have to be deduced by statistical guesswork from \n&gt;&gt; that page if you didn&#39;t already know the expected encoding? (Is this a \n&gt;&gt; public URL you can share?)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; In my Processor I manually forced the encoding like this (uri is a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ProcessorURI):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; uri.getRecorder().setCharacterEncoding(&quot;windows-1252&quot;);\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; However, although my JVM perfectly supports this encoding (I checked),\n&gt;&gt;&gt; things were still not working, specifically, the Euro currency\n&gt;&gt;&gt; character/symbol, coded by the byte 80 in hex in Windows-1252,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; appeared garbled when I converted the uri to a String via\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; String content = uri.getRecorder().getReplayCharSequence().toString();\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I looked at the source and found this strange comment in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; getReplayCharSequence() of RecordingOutputStream :\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; // TODO: take into account single-byte encoding may be non-default\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Closer examination of the code reveals that the comment is right - the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; encoding is downright ignored for single-byte encodings... this can be\n&gt;&gt;&gt; seen immediately by the fact that the encoding argument is not passed\n&gt;&gt;&gt; down to further methods in the chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So the stream of bytes is not correctly converted to a char (actual\n&gt;&gt;&gt; conversion appears in the charAt method of ByteReplayCharSequence):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; return (char)(c & 0xff);\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; where c is an int. I guess this formula is correct only for ISO-8859-1.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt; This is definitely a problem; I&#39;ve created a new bug:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1506\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think it&#39;s gone unnoticed for a while because:\n&gt;&gt;   - this masking won&#39;t hurt single-byte characters &lt;= 0x7F\n&gt;&gt;   - prevalent single-byte encodings are very similar in this range \n&gt;&gt; inherited from ASCII\n&gt;&gt;   - our usual configurations only use the ReplayCharSequence for link \n&gt;&gt; extraction, and link delimiters and link characters are often limited to \n&gt;&gt; ASCII, even when other content on the page varies\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe this could be easily fixed by a patch, but currently this\n&gt;&gt;&gt; clearly means only ISO-8859-1 is supported as a single byte encoding (\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I did not look much at multibyte encoding support but hope it is\n&gt;&gt;&gt; better).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt; Actually, it&#39;s a little worse than that: only bytes &lt;=0x7F are read \n&gt;&gt; properly from a (Single)ByteReplayCharSequence.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; As getting back the actual bytes is also quite difficult, the priority\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of this fix should be high IMHO.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s actually quite easy to get the raw bytes: use the \n&gt;&gt; RecordingOutputStream.getReplayInputStream method (or \n&gt;&gt; getContentReplayInputStream to skip the HTTP headers). That will give a \n&gt;&gt; raw byte stream of the recorded fetched content.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Jean-Noel\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On Mon, Jun 2, 2008 at 11:36 PM, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jean-Noël Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a problem with encoding today and took a look at Heritrix code.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately it seems to me (from my understanding of the code) that\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heritrix supports only ISO-8859-1 pages and UTF-8 pages.
