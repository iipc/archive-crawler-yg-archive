Notice that French domain has a few specific second top level \ndomains.\n\nI think that these three patterns will give you a general idea on what \nhas to be done for a World Wide broad crawl.\n\n\nAs you are probably already aware, you will need to watch out for \ndomains with a large number of subdomains.\n\nFor example:\n1) skyblog.com/skyrock.com will have about 2+ million subdomains; one \nfor each user/blog. These subdomains are virtual hosts that are hosted \nfrom some number of machines. If you don&#39;t have a reduce pattern to \nforce them all to a single machine you might hit them very hard (many \nconnections from each crawler node). On the other hand, if you put them \nall on a single machine, 2+ million hosts will eventually starve \nanything else on that machine.\nI personally like to put them to a single machine and use \nforce-queue-assignment in per host overrides to simulate IP politeness. \nYou might not get as much content as you want but that can be increased \nvia budgeting (see queue-total-budget and balance-replenish-amount options).\n\n2) nasa.gov has about 3000+ subdomains, but notice that we do not have \nspecific rule for it in the second reduce pattern from above. Majority \nof these NASA subdomains are not virtual hosts and they can handle a \nload -- our tax money at work :)\n\nObviously there is no single solution that fits them all, but with \nreduce pattern, per host overrides, IP like politeness and budgeting you \nshould be able to create a good generic configuration.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sure better reduction patterns are possible depending on what \n&gt; you&#39;re \n&gt;&gt; crawling; I believe we&#39;ve used other variants of this for our 6-\n&gt; machine \n&gt;&gt; crawls.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you share the one you used for the 6-machine crawls? \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; -Joe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
