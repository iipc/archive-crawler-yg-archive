If we are planning on collecting 1 billion total \npages (+ images and documents ). Is it reasonable to stop passing \ndiverted files after some point in the crawl?\n\nWe currently have collected 120 million pages (300 million URIs) on each \ninstance (total of 600 M pages, 1.5 billion URIs), and we have over 600 \nmillion URIs queued on each instance (total of 3 billion URIs).  When we \npass more diverted files, it seems that many of these URIs will never be \ncrawled.  Can someone explain how this would/could change the course of \nthe crawl if we would stop passing the diverted files at this point? \nWhat are the benefits, if any of doing one over the other?\n\nCan anyone talk about the effect of how the decision to pass diverted \nfiles has on a crawl over not passing them can change the results of a \ncrawl?\n\nThank you,\n\n--David\n\n"}}
