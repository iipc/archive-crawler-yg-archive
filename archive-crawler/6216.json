While launching\n&gt; &gt; Heritrix&#39;s WUI and setting up a job, the CPU =\r\nusage is about 4%. Strting\n&gt; &gt; a crawl job with several seeds quickly raise=\r\ns CPU usage to about 99%.\n&gt; &gt; However, pausing the crawl job does NOT reduc=\r\ne the CPU usage. Even more\n&gt; &gt; surprisingly, terminating a crawl job does n=\r\not reduce the CPU usg. Only\n&gt; &gt; when Heritrix WUI is shut down does the CPU=\r\n usage return to it was\n&gt; &gt; before the crawl job was started.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is th=\r\nis a known issue? Am I doing something wrong?\n&gt;\n&gt; This is not a known issue=\r\n, on MacOS or elsewhere.\n&gt;\n&gt; What JVM version and Heritrix version?\n&gt;\n&gt; Usi=\r\nng &#39;jstack&#39; against the Java process a few times in succession may\n&gt; give a=\r\n hint as to what Java thread(s) are still busy during a period\n&gt; (such as a=\r\nfter job termination) when there should be little to no\n&gt; activity.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m=\r\n not sure if the threads of a MacOS JVM are individually viewable in\n&gt; the =\r\nActivity Monitor (for example with the &#39;All Processeses,\n&gt; Hierarchically&#39; =\r\nview), but if so, it may be possible to correlate the\n&gt; Activity Monitor PI=\r\nD with one of the thread IDs in the jstack dump, and\n&gt; thus be certain whic=\r\nh thread(s) are busy.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n-- \nClaudio Martella\nDigital=\r\n Technologies\nUnit Research & Development - Analyst\n\nTIS innovation park\nVi=\r\na Siemens 19 | Siemensstr. 19\n39100 Bolzano | 39100 Bozen\nTel. +39 0471 068=\r\n 123\nFax  +39 0471 068 129\nclaudio.martella@... http://www.tis.bz.it\n=\r\n\nShort information regarding use of personal data.
