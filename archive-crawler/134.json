Groups Moderator,\n&gt; \n&gt; IMPORTANT NOTICE:\n&gt; You are receiving this notice because you are a moderator of one or\n&gt; more groups.  As part of our efforts to ensure that all Yahoo! Groups\n&gt; users enjoy the same high-quality service, we will implement the\n&gt; following service changes on Aug. 7, 2003:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Message Attachments: Yahoo! Groups will continue to deliver all\n&gt; attachments sent via email, however, the attachments will no longer be\n&gt; archived within the Messages area. You may continue to upload files\n&gt; and images to the Files and Photos areas of your groups.  Please\n&gt; re-upload any attachments you would like to preserve to the Photos or\n&gt; Files areas of your group. On Aug. 7, all attachments in the Messages\n&gt; area will be removed, and Yahoo! will be unable to retrieve such data.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Add Members: The &quot;Add Members&quot; feature will now allow you to add 10\n&gt; new members per day (e.g., the ability to directly add your friends\n&gt; and family to your group). You may still use the &quot;Invite Members&quot;\n&gt; feature to invite others to join your group.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Files and Photos: Groups web membership will be required to access a\n&gt; group&#39;s Files and Photos areas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your support as we make these changes that will allow us\n&gt; to continue offering a compelling, high quality, free service.\n&gt; \n&gt; For more details on the service changes described above, please visit\n&gt; our help section http://help.yahoo.com/groups/groups-56.html. Please do \n&gt; not reply to this message via email, as responses will not be read.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n&gt; The Yahoo! Groups Team\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
