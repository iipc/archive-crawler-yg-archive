Using it, you&#39;ll be subject to br=\r\nand new\n&gt; bugs -- up to and including things that render the crawler\n&gt; inop=\r\nerative until fixed.\n\nI got tired of being out-of-date tracking the automat=\r\ned builds since\nthere was no diff mechanism that didn&#39;t involve getting a c=\r\nompletely\nnew tree (and remaking the small code and integration changes to =\r\neach\ntree).  CVS at least allowed a way to get at the newer versions in\neas=\r\nier to digest chunks.\n\nSince I do want to keep up with the bleeding edge ch=\r\nanges, probably\nI&#39;ll keep my own versions of the distribution files around =\r\nfrom known\ngood builds as a way to protect against those kinds of issues.\n\n=\r\n&gt; If you use CVS HEAD, it can also be good to keep an eye on the\n&gt; &#39;archive=\r\n-crawler-cvs&#39; CVS commits mailing list -- so you see some\n&gt; indication of b=\r\nig changes and latest fixes:\n&gt; \n&gt;    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/for=\r\num.php?forum_id=3D34924\n\nI have been, thanks.  Its actually what prompted t=\r\nhe last update, as\nthere was some feature that looked interesting (can&#39;t re=\r\nmember exactly\nwhat).  I also want to get at the new JMX stuff that just go=\r\nt checked\nin.\n\nI hope this was an appropriate place for a message about pro=\r\nblems I\nwas having tracking that code.  In the future should those go here?=\r\n \nTo the developers checking changes in since the last good build?\n\nThanks =\r\nfor your help.\n\n-matt\n\n"}}
