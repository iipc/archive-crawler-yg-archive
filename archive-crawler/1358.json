I don&#39;t know why. the queued url and used memory are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still very low at that time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This sounds like an issue other than memory.  What does your frontier\n&gt; &gt; report say the threads are doing (What JVM?  What platform?).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could you explain the meaning of some parameters for frontier, such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as &quot;hold-queues&quot;, &quot;preference-embed-hops&quot;, &quot;host-valence&quot;, &quot;force-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; queue-assignment&quot;, &quot;host-queues-memory-capacity&quot;, &quot;use-bdb-already-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; included&quot;. since I can not find them in user manual.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are the details that are under the help question marks in the settings\n&gt; &gt; page not sufficent?  I reproduce them below.  Let me know if you need\n&gt; &gt; more detail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; use-bdb-already-included: &quot;Use disk-based Berkeley DB to hold the set of\n&gt; &gt; Already Included URIs. The Already Included URI set is by-default kept\n&gt; &gt; in memory. The continuous growth of this URI set in memory is one cause\n&gt; &gt; of out of memory exceptions.  Enabling this option, the Already Included\n&gt; &gt; set is kept on-disk in a Berkeley DB table. Enabling this feature will\n&gt; &gt; cause the crawler to harvest more documents before it runs out of memory\n&gt; &gt; at the cost of the crawler harvesting at a (progressively) slightly\n&gt; &gt; slower rate. Lookups in BDB as opposed to lookups done against a\n&gt; &gt; RAM-based Already Included set take about 4 times longer when the\n&gt; &gt; Already Included set is 10million items (0.5ms vs. ~2ms).  BDB Already\n&gt; &gt; Included lookups slow as the set grows at ~Log(n) rate.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; host-queues-memory-capacity: &quot;Size of each host queue&#39;s in-memory head.\n&gt; &gt; Once each grows beyond this size additional items will be written to a\n&gt; &gt; file on disk. Default value is 200 (i.e. 200 items kept in memory).  A\n&gt; &gt; high value means more RAM used per host queue while a low value will\n&gt; &gt; require more disk I/O. Lowest legal value is one.\n&gt; &gt; force-queue-assignment: &quot;The queue name into which to force URIs. Should\n&gt; &gt; be left blank at global level.  Specify a per-domain/per-host override\n&gt; &gt; to force URIs into a particular named queue, regardless of the\n&gt; &gt; assignment policy in effect (domain or ip-based politeness).  This could\n&gt; &gt; be used on domains known to all be from the same small set of IPs (eg\n&gt; &gt; blogspot, dailykos, etc.) to simulate IP-based politeness, or it could\n&gt; &gt; be used if you wanted to enforce politeness over a whole domain, even\n&gt; &gt; though the subdomains are split across many IPs.&quot; (You&#39;d use this\n&gt; &gt; facility to avoid hitting a host with many virtual servers too hard).\n&gt; &gt; host-valence: &quot;Maximum number of simultaneous requests to a single\n&gt; &gt; host.&quot; (This feature is not working reliably).\n&gt; &gt; preference-embed-hops: &quot;Number of embedded (or redirected) hops up to\n&gt; &gt; which a URI has higher priority scheduling. For example, if set to 1\n&gt; &gt; (the default), items such as inline images (1-hop embedded resources)\n&gt; &gt; will be scheduled ahead of all regular links (or many-hop resources,\n&gt; &gt; like nested frames). If set to zero, no preferencing will occur, and\n&gt; &gt; embeds/redirects are scheduled the same as regular links.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; hold-queues: &quot;Whether to hold newly-created per-host URI work queues\n&gt; &gt; until needed to stay busy. If false (default), all queues may contribute\n&gt; &gt; URIs for crawling at all times. If true, queues begin (and collect URIs)\n&gt; &gt; in an &#39;inactive&#39; state, and only when the Frontier needs another queue\n&gt; &gt; to keep all ToeThreads busy will new queues be activated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Yahoo!
