We are currently using H1 b=\r\nut will be switching to H3 later this year. We are curious about two things=\r\n related to writing metadata in WARC:\n\n1.\tdo H1 and H3 write metadata in WA=\r\nRC in the same way (meaning will the metadata coming from each of them the =\r\nsame)?\n2.\tis the default way of writing of metadata in WARC in both H1 and =\r\nH3 fixed or is there (an easy) way to customize it and how?\n\nThanks,\n\nrudol=\r\nf\n\n\n"}}
