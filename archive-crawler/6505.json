What part =\r\nof the release notes gave you that \n&gt; impression? We&#39;ll correct it.\n\nRegard=\r\ning my interpretation of Heritrix 3 being able to handle updates out of the=\r\n box, I inferred that from some document which said &quot;Heritrix now assumes a=\r\n job will be launched multiple times&quot;.\nSo I thought it may be updating it.\n=\r\n\n&gt; If you have the most aggressive duplication-reduction settings (sending =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;If-Modified&quot;/&quot;If-None-Match&quot; headers and respecting not-changed \n&gt; resp=\r\nonses from servers), and Heritrix is able to skip fetching an \n&gt; unchanged =\r\npage entirely, it won&#39;t even have the outlinks to continue the \n&gt; current c=\r\nrawl. (We don&#39;t carry the discovered links forward in the URI \n&gt; history in=\r\nfo.)\n&gt; \n&gt; So, if you want use those settings, it&#39;s up to you to feed the cr=\r\nawler \n&gt; those URIs from the earlier crawl(s) you want it to re-check.\n&gt; \n\n=\r\nI wrote a script which fetched all the crawled URI&#39;s and updated the seeds.=\r\ntxt with those URI&#39;s. It updated the mirror but it also crawled the externa=\r\nl domains.\n\nSo on looking into the surts.dump I found the external URI&#39;s we=\r\nre also considered.\n\nI figured out that the seeds.txt is used to construct =\r\nthe surts.dump and hence it fetches the external URI&#39;s also.\n\nIs there any =\r\nother way of supplying URI&#39;s to Heritrix apart from the seeds.txt.\n\n\nThanks=\r\n,\nSriram.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
