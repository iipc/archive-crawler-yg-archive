(As someone doing custom development \nwork, either the H1 SVN TRUNK or the H3 line might also be a suitable \nbase... a little harder to configure but much more flexible for dropping \nin your own components.)\n\nThe steps you&#39;ve followed -- making your JAR, adding a Processor.options \nfile, and ensuring those are findable on the launch classpath -- only \nserve to add your new classes as options in the configuration \nuser-interface. (Note that you don&#39;t even necessarily need to do a full \nlocal rebuild, though that may be helpful while integrating/debugging \nyour new code. You just have to drop the final results where a Heritrix \ninstall can find them.)\n\nTo actually use the new classes in a crawl, you still need to change an \nexisting crawl&#39;s configuration to use your classes rather than the \ndefaults. I recommend doing this via the web user-interface until/unless \nyou become familiar with the &#39;order.xml&#39; format. If all the other steps \nhave been followed properly, your new class(es) will appear in the \ndrop-downs of the &#39;modules&#39; configuration page.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 2/3/11 10:28 PM, Dhake, Pankaj wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi ,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am trying to customize the Heritrix 1.14.1 crawler for my use and am\n&gt; trying to replace the format in which the crawled contents are stored. I\n&gt; have written the necessary WriterProcessor, WriterPool and Writer for my\n&gt; purpose. As the developerï¿½s manual mentions I have made a jar which\n&gt; includes my classes and the Processor.options file with my writer\n&gt; mentioned in it. However, even after incorporating this changes and\n&gt; after that building Heritrix 1.14.1 with maven 1.0.2, the crawler still\n&gt; continues to use the ARCWriterProcessor and stores in the .arc format.\n&gt;\n&gt; Seems like I am missing some step. Please let me know if someone has\n&gt; already built changes in Heritrix.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanking You,\n&gt;\n&gt; Pankaj\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
