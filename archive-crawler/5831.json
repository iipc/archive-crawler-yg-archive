I understand Heritrix by default will persue all links it finds (including external ones).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am using Heritrix 2.0.0\n&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re just starting with Heritrix, we recommend using 1.14.3.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With the default configuration, crawling will generally stay on the \n&gt;&gt; sites defined by the seeds, but the crawler will go offsite to get URLs \n&gt;&gt; that appear necessary to render on-site pages (such as embedded images, \n&gt;&gt; scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This behavior comes from the \n&gt;&gt; &#39;TransclusionDecideRule&#39; -- so removing that rule or setting its various \n&gt;&gt; &#39;*-hops&#39; limits to zero will prevent the offsite collection.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On the other hand, if you do want necessary offsite resources, but find \n&gt;&gt; Heritrix sometimes going too many hops off, you could reduce those \n&gt;&gt; TransclusionDecideRule &#39;*-hops&#39; values without moving them to zero. \n&gt;&gt; Also, Heritrix always considers links found in Javascript or Flash to be \n&gt;&gt; like inline/embedded resources (because it can&#39;t tell the difference \n&gt;&gt; between those that load into the page, or only load on user navigation). \n&gt;&gt; So if you find the only reason Heritrix is wandering offsite is such \n&gt;&gt; links, you could disable Javascript extraction (in the ExtractorHTML and \n&gt;&gt; ExtractorJS) and Flash extraction (in ExtractorSWF).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
