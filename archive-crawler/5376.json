Just for clarification, when you mean\n&gt; make an index, you are suggesting to make a manual index (like in a\n&gt; DB)? Something like the list of URLs, and the offset into the arc\n&gt; file?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. You could start with that (Thats the default output when you run \n./bin/arcreader IIRC).  You can sort and binary search or get all \nfancy-pants -- or lazy -- and populate a bdb or lucene, etc., and ask it \nquestions  Or just give your ARCs to wayback and ask it \n(http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Jean-Noel\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Jul 30, 2008 at 6:35 PM, stack &lt;stack@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:stack%40duboce.net&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Make an index and search that. Make the index concurrent to the writing\n&gt; &gt; of ARC itself -- you&#39;d need to subclass the ARC Writer to accomplish\n&gt; &gt; this probably -- or make the index post-crawl. If you run\n&gt; &gt; ./bin/arcreader, it dumps out a line per record. You could start with\n&gt; &gt; this. Later you could sort them, etc. Or, just use an instance of\n&gt; &gt; wayback and ask it which ARC the URL resides in.\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jean-Noël Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My task is the following one: I need to search for a specific URL in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the ARC file. From reading the Javadocs it seems there is no facility\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for doing this, other than iterating through ALL records and manually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; checking the URL all the time. Obviously this is not very nice from a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; performance point of view.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there any alternative way of doing this? Does someone know of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reasonably modern and maintained tool to do this, or am I just on my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; own? If I am, I would appreciate help/hints for implementing this.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jean-Noel\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
