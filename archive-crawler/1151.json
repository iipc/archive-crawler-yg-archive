Use midfetch-\nfilters to \n&gt; abort the download of content-types other than those wanted \n(Aborted \n&gt; fetches have an annotation midFetchAbort appended to the crawl.log \n&gt; entry). Note that unless the same filters are applied at the \nwriter \n&gt; processing step, the response headers -- but not the content -- \nwill \n&gt; show in ARC files.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Setting up a crawl, you need to browse to the filters page and add \na \n&gt; *midfetch-filters* filter.  The ContentTypeRegexFilter makes most \nsense \n&gt; at the midfetch step; it looks at response content-type and runs \nthe \n&gt; supplied regex.  After adding, browse back to the settings page \nand add \n&gt; in a regex.\n&gt; \n&gt; Give us a shout if it gives you trouble.\n&gt; St.Ack\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
