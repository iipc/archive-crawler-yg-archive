We&#39;ve never considered that deployment \nscenario, there could be issues. In particular, we&#39;re always assuming \nlots of IO to local disk paths.\n\nAll the bundled JARs are necessary, though if you were skipping the use \nof certain extractor options (like Flash, Office DOCs, etc.) a few could \nbe dropped.\n\nEach library would have to be evaluated individually as to whether a \nlater version would be an acceptable substitute. I&#39;ve usually had good \nluck rolling forward to new versions of Apache libraries, but you never \nknow until you try. (Where it is harmless, we&#39;d be happy to update the \nofficial builds on request/report-of-no-problems, but usually only do so \nwhen there is a need for a fix or new functionality in the current \nversions.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 2/9/11 5:14 AM, psiinon wrote:\n&gt; Hi folks,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m looking for a crawler that I can embed in a client side Java app (the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy).\n&gt; Heritrix looks good, but I&#39;m worried about the number of jars in the lib directory, and the fact that many of them are out of date.\n&gt; For example, we already use commons-lang 1.4, codex 1.4 and logging 1.1.1.\n&gt; I dont want to revert these (or any other jars) to older versions.\n&gt; Can anyone tell me what the minimum set of jars I can add to my app in order to use Heritrix inline? And if I&#39;m likely to hit problems if I use later versions of any of them?\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Psiinon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
