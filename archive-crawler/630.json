I tried\n&gt;with various servers (IIS, Apache, and GWS) and they all appear to\n&gt;have the same behavior: if the content type of the requested resource\n&gt;is a complete mismatch of the Accept: header, the resource is returned\n&gt;anyway instead of returning a 406 as the HTTP/1.1 specification would\n&gt;imply they should.\n&gt;\n&gt;That would explain why forcing &quot;Accept: text/html&quot; will still return\n&gt;images with a 200 response.\n&gt;\n&gt;It could also be the case that the individual servers have content\n&gt;negotiation turned off, or it is not fully implemented, or...\n&gt;\n&gt;A quick scan of the Apache 2.0.50 content negotiation module would\n&gt;imply that a 406 should be returned.\n&gt;\n&gt;FWIW, I added the &quot;accept-headers&quot; parameter to the HTML fetcher so I\n&gt;could force the Accept-Language header --- I&#39;ve never used straight\n&gt;&quot;Accept:&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;    -tree\n&gt;\n&gt;-- \n&gt;Tom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\n&gt;Software Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n&gt;  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
