This source tag \nwill appear in the second-to-last field of the crawl.log.\n\nSo, you&#39;ll be able to see from the crawl.log the seed from which any URI \nwas discovered.\n\nNote that it&#39;s not guaranteed to be the seed from which the shortest \npath to the URI can be found -- the crawler sometimes follows longer-hop \npaths more quickly than shorter-hop paths, and the source tag will be \nthe seed from which the URi was actually discovered.\n\n(The above is true for 1.14.1; it looks like a bug in 2.0.1 is \npreventing the source tag from appearing in the crawl.log.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nalihoaliho wrote:\n&gt; Hi, i am trying to create a customize writer that needs to write out\n&gt; the crawled document as well as the seed of which the document was\n&gt; originated from (so that I can tell which document was from which seed).\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve tried a few things (modifying/recompiling the sources codes) and\n&gt; none of the solution are elegant because it touches too many files.\n&gt; Can someone who knows the heritrix codebase tell me what would be the\n&gt; easiest way to achieve this?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
