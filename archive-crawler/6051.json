My final goal is to get all the URLs of=\r\n professors&#39; mainpages on one host i.e www.cs.cmu.edu. So firstly, I plan t=\r\no fetch all pages that are within the host. However, I fail to do that.\n\nI =\r\ntried both the traditional &#39;hostscope&#39; and recommended &#39;decidingscope&#39; but =\r\nI still cannot achieve my goal. As English is not my native language, maybe=\r\n I misunderstand something in &#39;user manual&#39;. Would someone kindly answer se=\r\nveral questions?\n\n1.My seed is simply: &#39;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/&#39;. Is it righ=\r\nt?\n\n2.Is it possible that I simply use &#39;hostscope&#39; to achieve my goal? \n\n3.=\r\nIf not, how to configure &#39;decidingscope&#39;?\n\nThanks.\n\nChuan \n\n\n"}}
