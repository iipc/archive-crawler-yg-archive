Externalizable interface and than just using \n&gt; Sockets Inputstreams and OutputStreams  we wrap into ObjectInput and \n&gt; OutputStreams. That is very simple, robust and the fastest possible \n&gt; solution.\n&gt;\nAre you talking of nutch, Stefan?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ok. Its something to look at for sure.  As long as we implement against \n&gt;&gt; JMS interfaces, we can also try other providers (I&#39;ve worked with Spread \n&gt;&gt; in the past).\n&gt;\n&gt; Please take a look to mule.\n&gt; http://mule.codehaus.org/\n&gt; &quot;Pluggable connectivity such as Jms (1.0.2b and 1.1), vm (embedded), \n&gt; jdbc, tcp, udp, multicast, http, servlet, smtp, pop3, file, xmpp&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Especially multicast could be interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; For dynamic configuration of the server farm have you considered \n&gt;&gt;&gt; JINI. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Not seriously.  I&#39;ve followed it over time.  I have a bias that jini \n&gt;&gt; still needs work and would be more apt if we were coordinating 100s of \n&gt;&gt; crawlers rather the 3-10 we&#39;re currently trying to get going (3-10 will \n&gt;&gt; be more than a handful)\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree, we evaluated JINI as well and from my point of view it isn&#39;t \n&gt; production ready. However we was searching for our project for a \n&gt; mechanism to discover new worker nodes in the network and decide to \n&gt; use JXTA.\n&gt; JXTA isn&#39;t a good communication mechanism since it is slow (messages \n&gt; are send as XML) {as mentioned we using simple sockets and \n&gt; serializable objects} but it is a very well mechanism for discover and \n&gt; configure nodes in a &#39;cluster&#39;.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; This could be a interesting paper:\n&gt; http://jngi.jxta.org/jngi-paper.pdf\n&gt;\n&gt; sorry, just my 2 ... :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; Stefan \n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
