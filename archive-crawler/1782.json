These have been split into 4k subsets. A \n&gt; Heritrix process is assigned a 4k seed url set, an ip address and \n&gt; port. For Heritrix 1.0.4 AND 1.2.0 (yes I tried 1.4.0 first - with \n&gt; 1.4.0 I ran into some threading issues with jdk1.5.0) versions I had \n&gt; initial success, however after modifying timeouts and bringing the toe \n&gt; thread count down to 5 from 100 I have not yet been able to execute an \n&gt; extended crawl beyond just a few hours??? Every Heritrix process just \n&gt; sits there, hanging.\n\nI would definitely run Heritrix 1.4 in preference to 1.0.4 and 1.2.\n\nWhat sort of threading issues came up with Sun 1.5 JVM?\n\nHeritrix 1.4 does not require Java 1.5; it should run with the Sun\nand IBM 1.4.2 JVMs.\n\n&gt; Please review the order.xml config file I made below and send your \n&gt; pointers at will as My team would like to continue to use Heritrix for \n&gt; a web wide vertical biomedical search engine but I have to resolve \n&gt; this issue quickly now as I&#39;ve spent days trying to work around it so \n&gt; far with little success. Thank You.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a nutshell, why is Heritrix hanging without downloading only after \n&gt; a few hours given the order.xml file below?\n&gt; \n&gt;   - JVM: SUNWappserver jdk1.4\n\nI&#39;m unfamiliar with what &#39;SUNWappserver&#39; would mean here; is this any\ndifferent from Sun&#39;s plain JDK 1.4.2 JVM?\n\n&gt;   - RedHat 2.4\n\nWe&#39;ve run into a variety of problems with Linux threads hanging on\nall but the latest &quot;NPTL&quot;-based threading libraries (associated with\nglibc 3.2.4 or later).\n\nA Java thread dump could help determine if this is the case in your\nsituation.\n\n&gt;   - Crawling is autolaunched\n\nDoes this mean, from the command-line, using the &#39;-r/--run&#39; option and\na supplied ORDER_FILE?\n\n&gt;   - Crawling happens before the hang, approx 30k docs downloaded.\n&gt;   - what a java thread dump (generated with SIGQUIT) shows\n&gt;   \n\n\n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I click on &quot;Reports&quot; this is what I get:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; An error occured\n&gt; java.util.NoSuchElementException\n&gt; java.util.NoSuchElementException\n&gt; \tat java.util.TreeMap.key(TreeMap.java:431)\n&gt; \tat java.util.TreeMap.firstKey(TreeMap.java:286)\n&gt; \tat java.util.TreeSet.first(TreeSet.java:404)\n&gt; \tat org.archive.crawler.framework.ToePool.oneLineReport\n&gt; (ToePool.java:111)\n&gt; \tat \n\nThat&#39;s odd. This happens every time you click &#39;Reports&#39;?\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ===\n&gt; \n&gt; a tail of the &quot;local-errors.log&quot; file:\n\nThat output isn&#39;t much concern -- just typical transient connection\nfailures. Is there anything in runtime-errors.log?\n\nI suspect JVM threading problems on your 2.4-based-kernel. The Java\nSIGQUIT thread dump from the hung state would help recognize if your\nhang is like others we&#39;ve seen due to Linux threading issues.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
