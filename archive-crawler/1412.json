RHEL box is averaging 40pps \nand the SUSE on 60pps after 3 hours.  I&#39;ll let them run and then try \nanother set of 75k seeds.  It will be interesting to see if the \nnewer kernel really makes that big of a difference or if it&#39;s just a \nfluke.\n\nThanks,\nGreg\n\n\n&gt; The original options (PathScope, HostScope, and the default \nDomainScope)\n&gt; all do an iteration through the entire seed-list-derived list of\n&gt; acceptable URL-patterns to decide if a newly-discovered URL can be\n&gt; ruled in. With a 75K seed list, that inefficiency really hurts, and\n&gt; the stack dump may show most of your threads in *Scope checking.\n&gt; \n&gt; The newer, non-default SurtPrefixScope can more-or-less simulate \nall\n&gt; those original scopes, much more efficiently. A binary search \nthrough a\n&gt; sorted list of acceptable &#39;surt&#39; prefixes rules URLs in or out with\n&gt; far fewer comparisons.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
