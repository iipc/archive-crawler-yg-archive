I&#39;ve downloaded and impo=\r\nrted all the necessary files, and have declared an instance of Heritrix, an=\r\nd my best guess is that before you can run a crawl you have to pass it all =\r\nthe arguments that are passed to it when you run Heritrix through the web U=\r\nI. Could anyone tell me what exactly you need to do before it will run a cr=\r\nawl and start returning pages? \nUnless I&#39;ve totally misunderstood what need=\r\ns to be done..\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\n\n"}}
