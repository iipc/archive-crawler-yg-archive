Be aware \nthat if you have a large source file (millions of lines) it might take \nsome time to reconfigure the crawl.\n\nThis way, you can just pause, &#39;touch&#39; settings and resume.\n\n&gt; Something akin to re-read seeds.txt would be simply wonderful here.\n&gt; Re-read/apply the nocrawl.surt would save hours of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its interesting, for some time now, the problems have not been what to\n&gt; crawl, they are what not to crawl.\n\nHope this helps.\ni.\n\n"}}
