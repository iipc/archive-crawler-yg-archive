I have removed maven\n&gt; &gt; 1.1 and in=\r\nstalled 1.0.2 from the archive. I am using Ubuntu and jdk 1.5\n&gt; &gt; package f=\r\nrom sun itself. Even after commenting out that portion I am not\n&gt; &gt; able to=\r\n build the product. It fails on a plugin.jelly file without giving\n&gt; &gt; any =\r\ninformation about it.\n&gt; &gt; I need to integrate htmlunit with heritrix to cra=\r\nwl webpages with JS\n&gt; &gt; obfuscation so the binary would not help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi U=\r\ntsav -\n&gt; \n&gt; I am happy to help. There is some information here\n&gt; &lt;http://te=\r\nch.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/5632&gt;\n&gt; which should help=\r\n with the plugin.jelly problem, which is due to a\n&gt; dependency (qdox) not b=\r\neing available.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is strange that you see a problem with sun.net code=\r\n with the Sun\n&gt; javac. You might post a longer extract about this to the ma=\r\niling list\n&gt; to see if others can help.\n&gt; \n&gt; best,\n&gt; Erik Hetzner\n&gt; \n&gt; ;; E=\r\nrik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n&gt; ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
