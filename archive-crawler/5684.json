Thus, its cache-size is \ndetermined outside the other settings, in config.txt. Juergen&#39;s \nsuggestion is the best workaround for now.\n\nIn 2.2.x, the BDB environment(s) will again only be opened at crawl \nlaunch, so the cache-percent will return to being a normal setting.\n\nAlso related: starting in 1.14.3 and 2.0.3, crawl BDB environments will \nby default use the new BDB-JE &#39;shared-cache&#39; feature -- allowing all \nopen environments to use the same heap cache space. This should make \nsimultaneous crawls easier to configure and more efficient.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nJuergen Umbrich wrote:\n&gt; Hi Holger\n&gt;&gt; I hope I do not miss something obvious, but I believe to remember being\n&gt;&gt; able to modify &quot;bdb-cache-percent&quot;, which is particularly usefull to\n&gt;&gt; avoid OOM when using the BloomUriUniqFilter on machines with only\n&gt;&gt; moderate RAM, or when running multiple jobs in parallel.
