Please provide i to me...\n&gt;&gt; Or you can also provide where Heritrix does this normalization ?\n&gt;&gt; [Crawlers usually perform some type of URL normalization in order to\n&gt;&gt; avoid crawling the same resource more than once]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jigar\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Jigar,\n&gt; \n&gt; I think this is what you are after:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/url/canonicalize/package-summary.html\n&gt; \n&gt; You can download the Heritrix source code and extract what you need \n&gt; (adhering to the LGPL license of course).\n\nYes, those are the configurable &#39;canonicalization&#39; settings. These \naffect what URI is considered to have been &#39;included&#39;. That is, though \nURI N is scheduled, it is actually URI C = canonicalize(N) that is \nconsidered to have been scheduled. So all future URIs that also \ncanonicalize to C are considered redundant.\n\nThere is another kind of normalization which we do, inside the \nUURIFactory/UURI classes -- see the package:\n\n  http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/net/package-summary.html\n\nThese perform URI transformations that are mandatory or practically \nnecessary to generate a fetchable URI, following the behavior of popular \nweb browsers as much as possible. (UURI is an abbreviation for &quot;Usable \nURI&quot;.)\n\nThis UURI normalization always happens, and happens *before* \ncanonicalization.\n\nSo in fact if the URI originally discovered is O, it is first \nUURI-normalized...\n\n    N = uuri-normalize(O)\n\n...and this N version is what will actually be scheduled/fetched. This N \nversion is further canonicalized...\n\n   C = canonicalize(N)\n\n...for already-seen testing/tracking. Any future URIs that also \nnormalize-canonicalize down to C will typically be skipped as already-seen.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
