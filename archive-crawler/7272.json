My guess would be css that&#39;s generated dynamically on the server side, in which case that shouldn&#39;t present special problems for crawling. Heritrix does extract links from css. If you mean css generated dynamically on the client side using javascript, then that&#39;s trickier. Heritrix does its best to guess urls from javascript strings, but that link extraction can easily be foiled. Can you explain the problem further, perhaps with example urls?\n\nNoah\n\nOn 2011-08-09 04:27 , mike.pavlenko wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m using heritrix-1.14.4 and there are 3 different sites with dynamic CSS. Also I use wayback 1.4.2 and 1.6 for displaying my warcs.\n&gt;   Does heritrix support dynamic css extractor, if yes, how should it be configured.\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S. I tried it at different PCs and don&#39;t know if heritrix support such thing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
