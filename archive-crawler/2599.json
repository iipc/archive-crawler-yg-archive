I use\n&gt; this strategy this because I have 10,000 seeds, so it&#39;s impossible to just\n&gt; paste them in the seeds window.\n&gt;\nHave you tried just adding your 10k seeds to the file seeds.txt? i.e. \ncreate the job with the crawler set in the &#39;hold&#39; state, then after \ncreation, go fill the seeds.txt? While they won&#39;t show in the UI -- \nthere is handling in place for when the seeds list is too large to \ndisplay -- they should be processed properly.\n\n\n&gt; However, whenever I start the job, heritrix completes it immediately,\n&gt; without processing anything. When I go looking for my seeds file, I find\n&gt; that it is blank, or that it contains only the seed I manually entered via\n&gt; the WUI interface.\n\nIIRC, there may be issues putting seeds into anything but a file named \nseeds.txt that sits beside the job order file.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anybody see what&#39;s wrong with my strategy, and/or could somebody\n&gt; suggest what is the right way, in 1.6, to provide the seeds in a file,\n&gt; rather than via the WUI?\n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Marco\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Marco Baroni\n&gt; SSLMIT, University of Bologna\n&gt; http://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Computer security \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+security&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=BHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWDg&gt; \n&gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+training&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=v0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
