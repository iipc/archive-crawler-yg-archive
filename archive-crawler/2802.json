Every time I created several\n&gt; jobs, and then I let heritrix start crawling, but it seemed that only\n&gt; one job could be run at one time, and all the others were pending.\n&gt; However as I know, Wget could run a group of jobs at the same time. Is\n&gt; it a way I could run several jobs together in heritrix? Thanks a lot!\n\nHeritrix can only run jobs in series.  To run multiple concurrent jobs, \ninstantiate multiple instances of Heritrix.\n&gt;\n&gt; Have a nice day!\n\nYou too,\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
