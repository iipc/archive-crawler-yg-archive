A quick look at the code shows no\nreason \n&gt; why th=\r\nis type of recover should not work (Start here: \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.o=\r\nrg/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#1165).\n&gt; \n&gt; If you look at the or=\r\nder file in the UI, does it show &#39;recover-path&#39; \n&gt; pointing to the right pl=\r\nace (or is it empty)?  Does the recover.gz \n&gt; pointed to for sure exist?  A=\r\nnything in heritrix_out.log?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any particular reason for your favoring t=\r\nhe old style recover.gz log \n&gt; over checkpointing?\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n\nI just got =\r\nback to this issue recently I and noticed I was not\nincluding the settings =\r\nfolder into the job jar.

The script works fine.\n\nMy reason for choosing rec=\r\nover.gz log over checkpointing is that Im\nable to revisit all the seeds eve=\r\nn after the crawl has finished. They\nwere meant for similar purposes but I =\r\nguess they work differently \n\nSamuel\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
