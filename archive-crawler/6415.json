Attached you find the crawl log and the messages of the command line tool : ./htmlextractor\n&gt; The configuration works with other seeds therefore I assumed that the configuration is correct. I tried a lot of changes in the configuration but without success. But there could be a fundamental error. \n&gt; I am using heritrix-1.14.3, but I also tried the htmlextractor command line tool of heritrix 3 without success.\n&gt; In the arc file the content is binary too (Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Encoding: x-gzip) - see below. \n&gt; I am located in Germany and the IP address of the server delivering the web site is 62.96.140.140. \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know which changes in the configuration I can make.
