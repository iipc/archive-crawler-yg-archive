I mean\n&gt; it goes deeper.\n\nDecideRules have two parts: the condition under which they apply (in \nthis case, more than the configured number of hops), and then the \ndecision to apply in that case.\n\nTooManyHopsDecideRule is set up to always apply its default REJECT \ndecision, but if you hand-editted the order.xml, it&#39;s possible it was \nchanged to ACCEPT.\n\nHowever, from your frontier report, it looks like most queues have \nfinished, which implies some sort of limit has been successfully \napplied. Do you see URLs in the crawl.log with &#39;hops-path&#39; strings (the \ncollection of uppercase letters like &#39;LL&#39; or &#39;LE&#39;) longer than two \ncharacters?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
