With that setting disabled (and certain other settings retaining their default values), heritrix will fetch the content and extract links from it, as it normally does. Deduplication will still be enabled, too, except it will examine the content to check for duplication instead of asking the server. (Relevant settings include the warcWriter properties skipIdenticalDigests and writeRevisitForIdenticalDigests.)\n\nNoah\n\n\nsriram_varahan1 wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;  \n&gt;       I am using Heritrix-3.1.1 Snapshot release. \n&gt;\n&gt; I have enabled the deduplication feature. I first mirrored a site and got about 270 pages.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now I relaunched the job. Heritrix just checked for the seed url. It found there was no modification in it and hence it did not check the other pages in the site for updates.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this the expected behaviour in deduplication?\n&gt;\n&gt; As a workaround I  pulled all the links from the crawl.log and populated them in seeds.txt. It then checked the other pages as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any other way of getting around this problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sriram Varahan.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
