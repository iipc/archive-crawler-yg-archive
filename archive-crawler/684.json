It might be tricky to\n&gt; define the the desired behavior for various situations where resources\n&gt; are referred-to across site boundaries.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example: You might want different behaviors depending on whether\n&gt; your aim is for each ARC to be maximally self-contained (and separable\n&gt; from others), compared to if you were simply trying to group resources\n&gt; by hostnames/administrative domains.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are unlikely to implement such options anytime soon, as it does\nnot match\n&gt; our typical usage. However, if you wanted to add this capability\nyourself,\n&gt; we&#39;d be happy to give advice/feedback on your proposal or\nimplementation,\n&gt; and if the result is of general use, we&#39;d eagerly integrate it into the\n&gt; official releases.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
