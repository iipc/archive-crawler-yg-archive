Instead you&#39;d use a MatchesRegExpDecideRule, or for your \npurposes perhaps even MatchesFilePatternDecideRule, which includes \npre-designed patterns for non-HTML file suffixes.\n\nSo rules that should work would be:\n\n(1) RejectDecideRule\n(2) MatchesRegExpDecideRule with the right regex *and* a configured \nREJECT decision\n\n...and no other later rules that might overrule the REJECT with an ACCEPT.\n\n&gt; I also tried domainScope with an exclude filter. It contained only a \n&gt; URIRegExpFilter which returns true if the regular expression is \n&gt; matched.  But still it is not working.\n\nThis should also work if configured properly, though I (and others) \noften have a hard time remembering whether a filter should be returning \n&#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39; to have the desired accept/reject effect in different \ncontexts -- which is a reason why the more explicit DecideRule approach \nis now preferred.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n&gt;         The urls of the gif/pdf files, which get picked, match the \n&gt; regular expression (tested using a simple java program).\n&gt; That means the regular expression is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going wrong here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sajid\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 1/20/07, *Gordon Mohr * &lt;gojomo@... \n&gt; &lt;mailto:gojomo@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     sajid khan wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;  Hi,\n&gt;     &gt;  I dont want to save images and pdf files while crawling under the\n&gt;     &gt;  domainScope.\n&gt;     &gt;  So, I enabled the additionalScopeFocus filter and set it to return\n&gt;     false\n&gt;     &gt;  when the below reg exp is satisfied:\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;     .*(?i)(*&#92;&#92;.(jpg|jpeg|gif|tiff|svg|pdf))$*&lt;file://%5C%5C.%28jpg%7Cjpeg%7Cgif%7Ctiff%7Csvg%7Cpdf%29%29$/&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;  In spite of this, gif and jpegs get picked up.

A &#39;false&#39; just\n&gt;     means\n&gt;     &#39;this isn&#39;t something to be extra-added&#39; -- if the URL still is\n&gt;     accepted\n&gt;     by the general scope, it&#39;s still in.\n&gt; \n&gt;     That&#39;s why in the newer, recommended, and usually more efficient\n&gt;     DecideRule approach, every rule has both a test *and* a decision to\n&gt;     apply. A proper sequence of rules can accomplish almost every effect\n&gt;     imaginable.\n&gt; \n&gt;     In the classic scopes, to rule things out, set up excludeFilters.\n&gt; \n&gt;     If translating the classic approach to the chain-of-decide-rules\n&gt;     approach, the rules would roughly be...\n&gt; \n&gt;     (1) Set initial decision to reject\n&gt;     (2) If seed, set decision to accept.\n&gt;     (3) If in &#39;focus&#39; (domains in the case of DomainScope), set decision to\n&gt;     accept.\n&gt;     (4) If &#39;additional focus&#39; filter applies, set decision to accept.\n&gt;     (5) If transitively included by referring hops, set decision to accept.\n&gt;     (6) If &#39;excluded&#39; filter applies, set decision to reject.\n&gt; \n&gt;     ...with the last decision applied winning.\n&gt; \n&gt;     - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
