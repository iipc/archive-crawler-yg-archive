Is this module still functional or maybe I have add=\r\ned it to a wrong place?\n\nHere is my order file:\nhttp://ihave.bushiq.com/stu=\r\nff/order_20091022065616.xml\n\nWhat I want to accomplish is that I just want =\r\nto crawl 5 pages from each host. I tried QuotaEnforcer initially but this m=\r\nodule is really inefficient since when it finds new links to a host that ha=\r\ns reached it&#39;s quota it will still try to check them out from&quot;already-seen&quot;=\r\n database, will add them to queue if there are none and when the queue goes=\r\n active and it doesn&#39;t find them it will write them to log file. This means=\r\n that the crawling is using unnecessary amount of resources. \n\nIf I want to=\r\n crawl 5 pages from each domain it should do just that - 1. When extracting=\r\n links from URL check if domain is already in the already-seen database, if=\r\n it is check if it has reached quota, when it is not then add the links to =\r\nqueue but if it has then just drop the or write them to log file(would be n=\r\nice to be able to specify this too).\n\nI&#39;m thinking that this is not possibl=\r\ne right now and although I have spent weeks researching this very fine craw=\r\nler it seems that it is not possible, maybe I&#39;m just doing something wrong =\r\nthough. I can achieve this behavior with Mnogosearch but compared to Heritr=\r\nix it is not scalable and flexible enough for me.\n\nI&#39;m sure there are other=\r\n people too who are interested about configuring Heritrix this way since li=\r\nmiting URL&#39;s per host/domain is something everyone would probably want to d=\r\no and I&#39;m sure that they are already doing this but they might be doing thi=\r\ns as inefficiently as me.\n\nRegards\n\nOlinto\n\n\n"}}
