Almost always, these are due to problems on \nsites -- and aren&#39;t anything a crawl operator could or should address.\n\nWe log them just in case we need to go back and look closely at page \npotential-URI content that never even reached enqueueing (and thus \ndidn&#39;t appear as success/failure/retry in other logs). I&#39;d ignore this \nlogs&#39; contents unless/until you&#39;re investigating some specific issue \nthat you think might be explained by atypical/corrupt page URI content.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 7/16/10 10:32 AM, gomwi01 wrote:\n&gt; Hi. I am receiving the following message --&gt;&quot;http scheme specific part is too short: //&quot; https://, when attempting to crawl. Has anyone else experienced these errors in the uri-errors.log file before? If so, what should I adjust to get around this roadblock?
