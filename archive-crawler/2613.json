Only the lower level of the\n&gt; hierarchy (that corresponds to http://www.zzz.com.br) contains any\n&gt; configuration. Others levels are empty. \n&gt; \n&gt; But I want to apply these filters on the URI&#39;s from a specific domain.\n&gt; For example:\n&gt; * http://www.zzz.com.br/page.php?id=### (this URI is desired)\n&gt; * http://www.zzz.com.br/section/page.php (this URI is desired too)\n&gt; * http://www.zzz.com.br/print.php?id=### (this URI is not desired,\n&gt; because the content was visited before, the id&#39;s are the same and the\n&gt; uri has just the content on a good format for printing)\n&gt; * http://www.zzz.com.br/sectionNotDesired/page.php (this URI is not\n&gt; desired, because it&#39;s section does not matter)\n&gt; \n&gt; To apply 2 URIRegExpFilters on these URI&#39;s I created a override from\n&gt; the address http://www.zzz.com.br/. I think that it&#39;s sufficient to\n&gt; cover the main content and the sections of the seed. So the filters\n&gt; are on the lower level of the hierarchy (correspondent to\n&gt; http://www.zzz.com.br). \n&gt; \n&gt; Am I doing anything wrong? Or maybe is it a bug from Heritrix. \n\nThis should work, if there are no stray character on any of the\noverride segments and the filter regular expressions and settings\nare correct.\n\nWhat kind of scope are you using, and where are you inserting the\nfilter?\n\nAre you using regular expressions to match what&#39;s wanted, or\nwhat&#39;s excluded?\n\nFeel free to send you order.xml -- both global and the one in\nthe relevant override settings subditrectory -- to either the list\nor me directly for a closer look.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
