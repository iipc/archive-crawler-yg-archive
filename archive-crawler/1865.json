Some are more thought out then others and their\nimpor=\r\ntance varies wildly. \n\nSome of this is posted here to get some discussion, =\r\nother bits are mostly\npointed at the boys at the Archive. Basically, this i=\r\ns a mixed bag.\n\nRemaining time\n\nThis feature is of negligible use and is mo=\r\nre likely to confuse than inform\nusers. The time estimate is only going to =\r\ngive a reasonable figure if there\nis only one host left (or several hosts w=\r\nith a similar number of documents)\nand we&#39;re already done with the &#39;discove=\r\nry&#39; phase. This may be of use\ntowards the end of some focused crawls, but g=\r\nenerally this is of little\nvalue. Since this value is almost always wrong I=\r\n believe that it is far more\nlikely to confuse users. I also find it annoyi=\r\nng to have another time\ncounter as I occasionally get it mixed up when I&#39;m =\r\nlooking up the duration\nof the crawl, but that&#39;s a lesser issue.\n\nUnless th=\r\ne estimate can be improved significantly (and this requires taking\ninto acc=\r\nount the number of queues and their relative sizes and the\npoliteness restr=\r\nictions for anything approaching a reasonable estimate) I\nvote to remove th=\r\nis feature.\n\n\nThe &#39;Crawl resuming&#39; at the top of the progress-statistics.lo=\r\ng\n\nA change to how the crawls are started has led to a CRAWL RESUMING being=\r\n\nprinted at the top of the progress-statistics.log. Perhaps the events need=\r\n\nto be augmented to include a CRAWL STARTING that the progress-statistics.l=\r\nog\nwould ignore. In any case, this needs to be fixed.\n\n\nInclude actual memo=\r\nry used in the progress-statistics.log instead of or in\naddition to current=\r\n heap size.\n\nActual memory used is of much greater interest, especially whe=\r\nn looking\nthrough the log to see memory usage trends.\n\n\nDefault Bdb cache p=\r\nercent to something modest, like 35-40% (OOM errors)\n\nThe AR module encount=\r\nered some issues with the default setting. I&#39;m not\ngoing to vote for any on=\r\ne value, but I suggest that crawls should always\nretain a good chunk of mem=\r\nory after the Bdb cache grows to its maximum\nallowed size.\n\n\nGet rid of the=\r\n recovery journal in favor of decent crash resistance via Bdb \n\nThis is a b=\r\nigger issue (and I know it&#39;s something you guys want to do). The\nrecovery j=\r\nournal has never (for me) worked as a crash recovery tool. The AR\nfrontier =\r\nis able to reconstruct itself based on its databases without any\ntrouble. I=\r\nf done right, resuming a crawl could be done in a matter of\nseconds, instea=\r\nd of hours (or days). I&#39;d vote to make this the #1 priority\nfor 1.6!\n\n\nAllo=\r\nw frontiers to provide &#39;servlets&#39; that enables more detailed monitoring\nand=\r\n control.\n\nI don&#39;t really care how it&#39;s done, but we need to allow modules,=\r\n especially\n(or even exclusively) Frontiers, need to have customized contro=\r\nl pages!\n\n\nDisplay data, 4GB should be 4.442GB etc.\n\nNeed to improve how da=\r\nta amounts are condensed, currently the jump from\n4095MB to 4GB lacks granu=\r\nlarity. I&#39;d be happy to fix this if we could agree\non exactly how things ar=\r\ne supposed to be. My suggestion: show four\ncharacters. So we&#39;d go from 4095=\r\n MB to 4GB and then 4.001GB etc. when we hit\n40GB we go to 40.01 etc. same =\r\nfor the move from B to KB and KB to MB\n\nAdditionally, we could have a mouse=\r\n-over pop up the exact number of bytes.\n\n\nDefault log lines to show be 40 i=\r\nnstead of 50\n\nA bit of a nit-pick. I&#39;ve got a screen running at 1024 lines =\r\nof vertical\nresolution and 40 lines fill up my screen. Since not many users=\r\n are likely\nto have higher resolution (in fact I&#39;d expect the average to be=\r\n lower) I\nsuggest we amend the default value to 40 (or possibly 35).\n\n\nLink=\r\n from help to /help/regexpr.jsp\n\nI find this page invaluable when adding ne=\r\nw regular expressions, especially\nto crawls in progress. Lets you double ch=\r\neck those reg.expr. using the same\ninterpreter. The page has been available=\r\n for awhile, but either the link was\ndropped or it never existed. Either wa=\r\ny, a link should be added to the help\npage.\n\n\nCost assignment on -5000/-500=\r\n1\n\nMore of a question, do URIs that return with -500X &#39;cost&#39; anything? I&#39;d\n=\r\nsuggest that they shouldn&#39;t. After all, they aren&#39;t actually crawled. \n\n\nHo=\r\nstnameQueueAssignmentPolicy attaches the port number to the hostname\n\nIs th=\r\nis really sensible considering that these are used as the basic\npoliteness =\r\nunits. Different ports, same server. I&#39;d think we&#39;d want to\nhandle it all t=\r\nhe same way.\n\n\nDaily reports? Detailed look at the crawl, printed to a file=\r\n daily? \n\nI was thinking that it might be nice to add a &#39;Daily report&#39; feat=\r\nure to the\nStatisticsTracker. It would generate a (new) report file at a sp=\r\necified time\neach day. Information regarding the number of URIs, amount of =\r\ndata,\nbandwidth usage etc. would be printed, giving a nice summary on the p=\r\nrogress\nso far.\n\n\nURI reg.expr filter (OR based) that has a list of strings=\r\n instead of just\none.\n\nI find myself using a series of URI reg.expr. filter=\r\ns to tackle numerous\nissues. I was thinking that it might be useful to add =\r\na similar filter that\ncontained a list of strings. This would make it a lot=\r\n easier to add\nadditional filters while a crawl is in progress. I can handl=\r\ne this if you\nagree it&#39;s a good idea.\n\n\nIn help (and perhaps a link from th=\r\ne logs) provide a quick link to the\nresult codes (local, not on web).\n\nI fi=\r\nnd myself looking these up a lot. Having a handy, local reference would\nbe =\r\nuseful. Should include both the HTTP codes and the ones specified by\nHeritr=\r\nix.\n\n\nChanges to Meta-data, description do not have any effect.\n\nThis has b=\r\neen around for awhile I think. The only time this is written is\nwhen a prof=\r\nile/job is created. Changes seem to have no effect.\n\n\nAdd items crawled to =\r\nBdb reports for each queue.\n\nThe BdbFrontier report should list the number =\r\nor URIs crawled for each\nqueue. Currently you can sort of calculate this ba=\r\nsed on the expenditure and\naverage cost (which is of little use of you are =\r\nusing\nZeroCostAssignmentPolicy).\n\n\nBdbFrontier: Add a log that details when=\r\n queues are created and move from\nactive to inactive and finally to exhaust=\r\ned.\n\nThis would make it easier to monitor crawls. Basically when a queue mo=\r\nves\nbetween any of the above states a line should be written in the log. Th=\r\nis\nway you could quickly grep through the log and see how that queue is bei=\r\nng\nprocessed. \n\nThe log line might look something like this:\n\n[time-date] [=\r\nqueue-name] [old state] [new state] [queue-size] [URIs crawled]\n[total expe=\r\nnded] [last cost] [average cost]\n\n\n- Kris\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0000_01C55F85.9A9740A0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META HTTP-=\r\nEQUIV=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META N=\r\nAME=3D&quot;Generator&quot; CONTENT=3D&quot;MS Exchange Server version 6.5.6944.0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;TITLE=\r\n&gt;A mixed bag of issues, thoughts and suggestions (long)&lt;/TITLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BO=\r\nDY&gt;\n&lt;!-- Converted from text/rtf format --&gt;\n\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=3D2 FACE=3D&quot;Aria=\r\nl&quot;&gt;The following is a mixed bag of issues, thoughts and suggestions that oc=\r\ncurred to me during the last few weeks as I worked on the AR module and was=\r\n managing a broad crawl.
