Comment lines begin with &#39;#&#39;.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When I view the settings after setting some seeds, however, it says,\n&gt; &quot;Seed list too large to edit&quot; under seeds, with the words &quot;seed list&quot;\n&gt; linking to what I put in the seeds box.  This happens even if we only\n&gt; list one seed.  What is going on?\n\nThis is probably the result of a recent bug fix in HEAD.\n\n  [ 1102755 ] seeds text area truncates seeds; big seed lists break config\n  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1102755&group_id=73833&atid=539099\n\nThe problem that motivated the change is that the browser textarea\ncannot contain very large seed lists -- in fact in some cases a large\nlist sent back from the server will cause long pauses or rendering\nproblems on the &#39;settings&#39; page, and lead to a textarea with truncated\ncontents.\n\nIf the settings page does display, and is then resubmitted, you can\nwind up inadvertently losing seeds you&#39;d previously entered.\n\nTo guard against this, code was added to disable the textarea\ndisplay for seed lists &gt; 32K. That limit is arbitrary; I could\nnot find a definitive reference for practical browser implementation\nlimits in this regard.\n\nYou shouldn&#39;t see this problem listing a single-seed, unless you&#39;ve got\na ton of non-URL content (comments?) in your entry.\n\nIf you are seeing it with tiny seed lists, there&#39;s a bug in the fix.\n\nMore generally, the method for entering and changing seeds needs\nreworking to better support large seed lists via the web UI.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n"}}
