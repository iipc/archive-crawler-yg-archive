Is it feasible to modify the UriPr=\r\necedencePolicy and other classes?\n&gt; &gt; I am new to this, so it will require =\r\na lot of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fine control over the order that links within a single =\r\npage are handled \n&gt; has never been a design goal of Heritrix. In its usual =\r\ncrawls, it&#39;s most \n&gt; common to get all links from a page, and relatively qu=\r\nickly, so fine \n&gt; ordering control among them is superfluous.\n&gt; \n&gt; FOr your=\r\n information, generally, the links are discovered on a page \n&gt; top-to-botto=\r\nm, and there&#39;s a preference for enqueuing &#39;embeds&#39; (inline \n&gt; images/script=\r\ns/etc) for fetching before navigational outlinks. There are \n&gt; a few settin=\r\ngs on the &#39;frontierPreparer&#39; processor that can also \n&gt; slightly bias thing=\r\ns in different directions, but most people shouldn&#39;t \n&gt; need to mess with t=\r\nhem (and none of them do your kind of reordering \n&gt; within a page).\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne reorderings you describe are certainly possible with added code, but \n&gt; n=\r\not very useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re set on this particular course, know that the=\r\n various \n&gt; &#39;extractors&#39; are where Heritrix finds links in content; the \n&gt; =\r\n&#39;CandidatesProcessor&#39; and &#39;CandidatesChain&#39; are where discovered links \n&gt; a=\r\nre filtered or prepared for insertion into the frontier, and the way \n&gt; the=\r\ny&#39;re inserted controls the order they&#39;re later fetched. So those are \n&gt; the=\r\n areas to learn to make the right changes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good luck,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Noah Levitt &lt;nlevitt@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As I mentioned previously, you can create a custom=\r\n implementation of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; UriPrecedencePolicy to implement your desired crawl=\r\n order. You can see how\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the precedence value you generate is used in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; BdbMultipleWorkQueues.calculateInsertKey(CrawlURI). Notably, the preced=\r\nence\n&gt; &gt;&gt; value only accounts for one byte of the insert key, so you&#39;re lim=\r\nited to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 255 precedence levels. There is room for finer customization, =\r\nbut that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would involve custom implementations of other classes in addi=\r\ntion to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; UriPrecedencePolicy.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; might be more\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;   advanced usage than you&#39;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; re\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   comfortable with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; , especia=\r\nlly if you didn&#39;t understand my previous emails.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m still not sure wh=\r\nat you&#39;re trying to do, exactly.
