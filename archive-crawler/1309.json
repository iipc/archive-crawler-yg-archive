Whats it do?\n\n&gt; I was very surprised to see\n&gt; that my module&#39;s constructor was called twice!  (This was seen via\n&gt; debugging prints to heritrix_out.log.)  Suspicious, I then reran the\n&gt; order file with the -n switch on heritrix.  Without the console, the\n&gt; constructor was called only once, as expected.\n&gt;\n&gt; Without looking at the .jsp&#39;s in any detail, it appears that each\n&gt; invocation of my module comes after a slightly different series of\n&gt; webapp events.  In Java-land, both invocations started from\n&gt; ThreadPool.java line 511 (in PoolThread.run).  The non-console run\n&gt; starts with Heritrix.main which calls doStart which calls\n&gt; doOneCrawl and is then off and running.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone else observed this problem with the console?  Was it just\n&gt; operator error on my part?  \n\n\nNo error on your part.\n\nI&#39;m guessing what you&#39;re seeing is the construction of two instances?\n\nThe console sets up a CrawlJob instance for all jobs it knows of \nincluding past crawls found in the jobs directory.  The CrawlJob \nconstructor calls the settings&#39; handler initialize method using each \nfound crawl jobs order file.  The settings&#39; handler initialize is \ninstantiating an instance of each module found in the order file -- an \ninstance per crawl job.  This is the double-call to the constructor I&#39;m \nguessing you&#39;re seeing.  Oh, the console also sets up at least the \ndefault profile, which is nought but a CrawlJob in another guise -- \nwhich probably explains the dbl-construction call in a new instance.\n\nSomeday figure a more lightweight CrawlJob representation -- especially \nfor old jobs.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It can be dangerous to have your constructor called twice, since you\n&gt; might want to do some one-time I/O, for example.  Since the problem\n&gt; can be worked around, it is not too serious, but I was curious.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards, D.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
