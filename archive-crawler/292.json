Indeed I upgraded to 0.6.0 over the \nweekend: amazing how close a 9 looks to a 6 given enough lack of sleep\n\nIn English (to the best of my ability), what I am trying to do is use \na separate order for each site I need to crawl. Each order hence has \na single seed. The purpose is to place an upper bound on the number \nof &quot;useful&quot; bytes downloaded for each crawl order (about 100K or 1MB \nsay). In other words, stop crawling the site once we have downloaded \nsome number of usable bytes. I thought setting a max size limit on \nthe ARC file would stop logging past that point, but I see now that \nit means a slightly different thing. I tried the number of files \nlimit and while it works, I am not sure it matches my intent as some \nfiles may be noticably shorter than others. \n\nI am using a DomainScope crawl per the settings in the Profile used \nto create the Job.\n\nBased on the information you sent me, I need to think about what \nmight serve my purpose. Thanks for pointing me at the right code in \nARCWriter. \n\nSeb\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Thanks for trying Heritrix Seb.\n&gt; \n&gt; See below.\n&gt; \n&gt; sebastiandelachica wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I have been playing around with heritrix for a few weeks now and I \nam \n&gt; &gt;in the process of turning it loose on a controlled environment for \n&gt; &gt;one of my research strands. I am currently using version 0.9.0. My \n&gt; &gt;objective is to limit the amount of data scooped from a site onto \nthe \n&gt; &gt;ARC file. I tried using the HTTP Processor max-length-bytes and \nthe \n&gt; &gt;Archiver max-size-bytes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Do you mean 0.4.0. You say 0.9.0 above.  We just released 0.6.0 on \n&gt; friday.  Try it if you haven&#39;t already.  Lots of fixes and \nimprovements.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re doing a broad crawl, you have the following options \navailable \n&gt; to you:\n&gt; \n&gt; max-bytes-download\n&gt; max-document-download\n&gt; \n&gt; These options are not available in a domain scoped crawl which \nseems to \n&gt; be what it is you&#39;d like to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tell us more about what it is that you&#39;d like.\n&gt; \n&gt; The max-length-bytes options limits size of a particular download \nonly.  \n&gt; The max-size-bytes  is upper-bound on the size of ARC files written \n(See \n&gt; the code here http://crawler.archive.org/xref/index.html).\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;The Processor max-length-bytes seems to work at some level as the \n&gt; &gt;requests are reported as length-truncated in the logs, but the \nactual \n&gt; &gt;HTML files still make it into the archive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Archive max-size-bytes appears to be ignored. Looking at the \n&gt; &gt;code, it does not seem to be used by the ARCWriterProcessor class \nor \n&gt; &gt;any other class for that matter...I just starting digging through \nthe \n&gt; &gt;code earlier today.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I continue my experimentation and code reading, but figured, I&#39;d \n&gt; &gt;check in to see if I am missing something very obvious or if \nanyone \n&gt; &gt;had experienced similar behavior.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance for your time,\n&gt; &gt;Seb\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
