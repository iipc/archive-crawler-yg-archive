So, I am just trying to estimate how many concurrent,\n&gt; single domain crawls, I can run.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas?\n\nWe have no rules-of-thumb and don&#39;t crawl this way at IA, so don&#39;t have \nmuch guidance to offer.\n\nThe main thing to watch out for is the way the BDB-JE environment -- of \nwhich there is one created per crawl -- by default takes 60% of heap \nspace. Obviously, you can&#39;t have 2 of those (120%) in one JVM, so \ndefinitely set that value much lower for crawls in the same JVM.\n\nOtherwise, a narrow crawl that stays on just 1 (or a couple of related) \nsmall sites shouldn&#39;t need much in the way of either worker threads or \nmemory. It&#39;s plausible that you could run dozens inside a 2GB heap, so \nit&#39;s worth a try.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
