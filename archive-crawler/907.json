Help...This is not my day with heritrix today...\n\nIt appears you got this error while interacting with the web UI. What\nhad you just attempted to do?\n\nI think there may be a problem in 1.0.0 and HEAD where a completed\ncrawl&#39;s running structures are kept around -- essentially creating\na memory leak.\n\nIt&#39;d be especially likely to cause problems at the moment a subsequent\ncrawl is launched, as a batch of new object creation (including one giant\nobject) happens at that time.\n\nThis looks like a new bug: old crawls used to be garbage collected\nthroughly. I&#39;m investigating.\n\nAnother observation about memory usage: because Heritrix queues URIs\nby host, and a number of other key structures and policies exist\nper-host, its memory usage is more sensitive to the total number of\nunique hosts discovered than the total number of URIs discovered/\ncrawled/pending.\n\nSo, while Heritrix 1.0.0 could crawl 10 million pages from a hundred hosts\nin a reaonable amount of heap RAM (possibly as little as 256M), crawling\njust 1 million pages spread out over 50,000 hosts would require a much\nlarger heap.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
