With that enabled, heritrix will record the seed that &quot;gave birth&quot; to each url in crawl.log, and will also produce an extra report called source-report.txt. In code, the source seed is available from a CrawlURI with curi.getString(CrawlURI.A_SOURCE_TAG).\n&gt; \n&gt; Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; anas elghafari wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Forgot to say that I am using release 1.14.3\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Sat, Dec 26, 2009 at 1:56 PM, anas elghafari \n&gt;&gt; &lt;anas.elghafari@... &lt;mailto:anas.elghafari@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     I am storing URIs into a Database and want to store which seed gave\n&gt;&gt;     birth to which URI.
