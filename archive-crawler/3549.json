Could anyone\n&gt; please let me know if:\n&gt; 1. Heritrix works well in J2EE? Has anybody been building such an\n&gt; application?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nJ2EE is a broad spectrum of technologies.  What in particular are you \nlooking for?\n\nOut on our continuous build server, \nhttp://builds.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/artifacts/HEAD-heritrix/20061120234211/, \nit packaged as a WAR.  Spotty reports from the list would indicate \nHeritrix basically works packaged so.  In the past, I&#39;ve played w/ \npackaging Heritrix as a SAR.  On deploy to a J2EE container, Heritrix \nregistered itself with the container&#39;s JNDI and JMX Agent services and \ndeployed its UI.\n\n&gt; 2. Heritrix is stable in a multi-threading environment?\n&gt;\n\n\nYes.\n\nIf you are planning on integrating Heritrix, this page (written by \nShifra Raffel) may be of help: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?EmbeddingHeritrix.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Your reply will be much appeciated!\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
