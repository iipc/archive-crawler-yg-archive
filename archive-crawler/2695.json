We would like to know the current ideas if any \n&gt; exists.\n\nThe &#39;cost assignment&#39; policies are a form of prioritization which,\ndepending on your settings, can affect both the order of URIs in\nindividual queues, and the amount of effort spent on a queue in\ntotal.\n\nSpecifically, all other things being equal, URIs of higher &#39;cost&#39;\nare inserted further back in individual queues. The idea is that\nproper choice of a cost assignment policy can make URIs of diminishing\nvalue -- such as URIs with long calendar-like query-strings, or\nmatching other patterns to be determined -- &#39;high cost&#39; and thus\nuncrawled until other higher-value &#39;low cost&#39; URIs are finished.\n\nFurther, a queue&#39;s chance to be &#39;active&#39; (eligible to supply URIs\nto waiting threads) versus &#39;inactive&#39; (piled up among other waiting\nqueues) is controlled by the &#39;budgetting&#39; settings:\n\nEach URI completed results in a charge (of its &#39;cost&#39;) against its\nqueue&#39;s running budget; when the budget is depleted the queue must\nwait again at the back of the &#39;inactive&#39; queues for a chance to get a\nreplenished budget.\n\nSince &#39;high cost&#39; URIs deplete the budget faster, queues dominated\nby such URIs will get less crawler attention -- as long as such\nattention is being rationed by something other than the need to\nbe polite -- than other queues dominated by &#39;low cost&#39; URIs.\n\nIt is also possible to use the overrides mechanism to set the\n&#39;replenish&#39; amounts different for different hosts/domains -- so\nsome queues get more or less &#39;active&#39; time compared to &#39;inactive&#39;\ntime.\n\nWe believe these mechanisms have helped a saturated crawler spend\nless time on junk/chaff, and we&#39;ve used varying replenish budget\nsettings, in overrides and generally, to bias our crawlers towards\ncertain patterns of access. But we don&#39;t have any firm qualitative\ndata on the improvements they provide; it&#39;d be a good area for some\ncontrolled study.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
