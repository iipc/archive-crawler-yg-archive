However, the\n      httpclient jar in our lib/binaries project directory hasn&#39;t\n      yet been updated. I&#39;ll update it today.\n\n  (2) To add to the HTTPClient library perfect byte-level retention\n      of HTTP requests and responses, we&#39;ve created patched versions\n      of several of its classes. (The functionality couldn&#39;t be easily\n      added by subclassing.)\n\n      As you&#39;ve noticed, these new classes are in the /oversrc (override\n      src) directory. Project classpaths should be adjusted to ensure\n      the classes in this directory are consulted before the standard\n      HTTPClient library. This change hasn&#39;t yet been made to the\n      official build script. I&#39;ll also update it today.\n\nWith those two changes, you should get a good build.\n\nOtherwise, over the last few days some reorganization and refactoring\nhas been occurring (and will be continuing), sometimes leaving the\nCVS repository code in a semibroken state, in some cases requiring an\nupdated &quot;crawl-order&quot; file to supply new necessary configuration.\n\nWith only two of us in the same room here at the Archive working on\nthe code, we&#39;ve been a bit lax in keeping the CVS complete and consistent.\n\nKnowing you&#39;re giving it a try, and also in preparation for our new team\nmembers arriving soon, we&#39;ll update things and post a bulletin when\nthey should be more amenable to tryout.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
