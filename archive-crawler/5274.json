I have a page\n&gt; encoded in windows-1252, and Heritrix is not able to read it\n&gt; correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is better encoding support planned in the reasonable near future? This\n&gt; seems not a totally trivial thing to do (else I coul have tried) as\n&gt; the code is rather low level (ReplayCharSequence is probably the place\n&gt; that would need to be fixed) and I am not sure how to proceed.\n\nHeritrix should already support many other encodings -- limited mainly \nby what support is in your Java VM.\n\nAs per HTTP/1.1, when no other charset is specified, ISO-8859-1 is \nassumed. See:\n\n   http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.7.1\n\nCan you be more specific about the problem you encountered? What did \nHeritrix not read that you tried?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
