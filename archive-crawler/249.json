Is it live code, and should I write tests \n&gt;&gt;for it ?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeah, it looks like the &#39;&#92;&#92;&#92;r&#39; would end up in unescape.raw buffer as \n&gt; just &#39;r&#39;.  I believe JavaLiterals is about to go into use (Its a new \n&gt; class just added by our Gordon).\n&gt; \nI&#39;ll add tests for these, and fix the bug.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;* MemQueue exposes all the methods from LinkedList, since it implements \n&gt;&gt;it.  Maybe encapsulating an instance would be better, so odd behaviour \n&gt;&gt;can&#39;t happen if other code goes behind your back and casts it to a \n&gt;&gt;LinkedList (I can do these changes if you like).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This sounds reasonable.\n&gt; \nAnd I&#39;ll implement this.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
