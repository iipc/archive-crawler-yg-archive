If anything earlier than \n1.10.2, I recommend upgrading: there&#39;s a fix to an issue with an \nincluded third-party library (DNSJava) using an excessive amount of memory.\n\nIf you are encountering recurring OOMEs and have the option of using \nJava 1.6/6.0, I recommend using it. It gives more useful stack dumps \nwhen hitting OOMEs -- sometimes useful -- and if you get to deeper \nanalysis has other benefits as well.\n\nAlso, as long as your planned heap size can be achieved with a 32bit \nJVM, it is beneficial to use one -- even if you are on a 64bit \nprocessor/OS. 64bit JVMs require larger heaps to store the same number \nof objects; one estimate I have seen is that you need a 40% larger heap \nwith a 64bit JVM than a 32bit JVM.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nmikbrt wrote:\n&gt; I was wondering if anyone was getting OutOfMemoryErrors thrown when\n&gt; checkpointing.  On my system (8GB memory, 1GB allocated to the heap) I\n&gt; have checkpointing running every twenty four hours and it crashed\n&gt; after only a few days.  The checkpointing as far as I know is only\n&gt; rolling over the logs, not writing the (jdb?) files.  If anyone has\n&gt; any ideas that might help, or if you need more information to help me\n&gt; please let me know, thanks!\n&gt; Mik\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
