I&#39;m crawling\n&gt;nytimes.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;1) Although I&#39;ve enabled the domain scope filter, my crawls\n&gt;   are running off to things like ad.doubleclick.net.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWhat Kris said earlier.\n\n&gt;2) It doesn&#39;t look like I&#39;m actually getting through the login\n&gt;   pages.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYou saw this earlier note,  \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/801,  I wrote in \nresponse to an earlier note of yours on how the login page is disallowed \nby robots.txt?\n\n&gt;Since this list probably doesn&#39;t permit attachments, I tar&#39;d the\n&gt;logs, crawl.xml, and seeds.txt and put them at:\n&gt;\n&gt;http://l.armory.com/~cerise/heritrix.tgz\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nI see you are choosing to ignore robots.txt going by your order file \nposted above.  Please then remove the &#39;heritrix&#39; from your &#39;user-agent&#39; \nidentifier and from your &#39;from&#39; address so the software itself doesn&#39;t \nget mislabelled a miscreant, non-honoring of robots.txt, by an overtaxed \nNYT webmaster and so we aren&#39;t contacted if complaints about a robot \nroaming in barred locales.\n\nLook at your &#39;credential-domain&#39; configuration.  It has a &#39;http://&#39; \nprefix.  It shouldn&#39;t have it here.  That looks like it might be the \nproblem (smile).  I&#39;ll clean up doc. and help text hereabouts.\n\nThis login stuff is awkward to debug -- especially on large sites.  Work \non specifying as narrow a crawl as possible.  To aid debugging, add \n&#39;org.archive.crawler.fetcher.FetchHTTP.level = FINE&#39; to \n&#39;conf/heritrix.properties&#39; and restart.  It&#39;ll output more detail on \nwhat the http fetcher is doing.  The logs will  not say if the auth has \nbeen successful or not -- the breadth of possible success indicators is \ntoo vast -- but you&#39;ll at least be able to see POST and setup of auth \nsubmission.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;I suspect I have something setup wrong (since I imagine this is\n&gt;pretty well tested).  If these are bugs, is there a bugzilla for\n&gt;heritrix?\n&gt;\n&gt;-Phil/CERisE\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
