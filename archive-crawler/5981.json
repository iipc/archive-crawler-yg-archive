The \nselftest configurations hadn&#39;t been updated, resulting in the behavior \nyou saw. This should be fixed now.\n\nOur automatic tests were hung -- so the problem was evident on the \ndedicated build machine, but hadn&#39;t generated a failure notice.\n\nIf running from the latest SVN, you may want to watch the build machine \n&lt;http://builds.archive.org:8081/continuum/servlet/continuum/target/ProjectBuilds.vm/view/ProjectBuilds/id/76&gt; \nand the source-repository commits list \n&lt;http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=archive-crawler-cvs&gt; \nfor major or destabilizing changes before grabbing updated code.\n\nAlso, just yesterday I added a new wiki page for highlighting \noperator-visible changes between releases (before release notes or other \ndocumentation is ready). See:\n\nhttp://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/H3+Dev+Notes+for+Crawl+Operators\n\nThis is in addition to the issue reports like the JIRA &#39;roadmap&#39;, \nshowing the next planned releases and issues intended/fixed for each:\n\nhttp://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nprogre55 wrote:\n&gt; Hi people!\n&gt; \n&gt; Today, after another svn update, I tried to &quot;re-install&quot; heritrix 3 by calling &quot;mvn install&quot;. However, I noticed that there have been introduced some interactive tests :) not sure if it&#39;s on purpose or not, but the test creates a job called &quot;selftest-job&quot; and pauses it. The only way I found to continue the build, was to open the job (https://localhost:8443/engine/job/selftest-job) on browser, log in by the password provided during the creation of the job in the terminal, and unpause it. oh and this happens about 10-15 times! =)\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon, not sure if that&#39;s done on purpose, but could you try to fix that, please? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance :)\n&gt; \n&gt; cheers,\n&gt; Ikrom (saplo.com) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
