So inserting override rules at other places in \nthe rule-ordering is not possible.\n\nI was in a simple test able to add a reject-all scope rule in an \noverride sheet. It appeared at the end of all rules and had the expected \nrejection effect on URIs to which it was mapped, but not other URIs.\n\n(Attempting to reorder the new rule up into the inherited rules \ngenerated an ugly exception. Both docs and the UI should be more clear \nthat such mixing isn&#39;t supported.)\n\nThe UI for configuration is changing yet again in the 2.2 work, but we \nhope that adopting the Spring model will make the underlying storage \nformat and relationships between configured components (ie now beans) \nmore understandable.\n\nIt would be appropriate to file bugs for any or all of the following:\n\n- your override sheet rules don&#39;t take effect at all, even at the end\n\n- the UI or docs don&#39;t explain what&#39;s allowable, or mislead about what \nis allowed (like suggesting you might be able to mis the ordering of \nglobal and override rules)\n\n- you get unhelpful error stacks from the UI or in logs when attempting \ncertain operations\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nJean-NoÃ«l Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am using Heritrix 2.0.1. &lt;http://2.0.1.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I created a sheet that is associated to www.example.com \n&gt; &lt;http://www.example.com&gt;. This sheet has its own root, root:scope, and \n&gt; root:scope:deciderules sequence. However everytime I launch the crawl, \n&gt; it seems like only the settings from the global sheet are used... Eg, if \n&gt; I have there a single RejectRule, the crawl instantly stops.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience, Heritrix is awesome as a crawl engine, but \n&gt; configuration is completely buggy. Not only does the web GUI is not very \n&gt; convenient, but so far I have had troubles with it almost everytime I \n&gt; try to use a different sheet than the global one... the only way to \n&gt; achieve something is to use the global one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I missing something or should I report a bug? (I already reported \n&gt; several related to the configuration interface)\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean-Noel\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: and trying to mix rules from the global sheet and another sheet is a \n&gt; nightmare, moving them up and down always fail because it seems the \n&gt; indexes are not maintained correctly. This is probably actually not \n&gt; supported.\n&gt; \n\n"}}
