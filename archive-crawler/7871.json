Links off of a seed \nare 1 hop, links from 1 hop pages are 2 hops, etc.\n\nmax-trans-hops caps the number of the transclusion hops in a row that \nwill be followed. So if a page has a css stylesheet that imports another \nstylesheet that sets a background image, that image will only be \ncaptured if max-trans-hops is at least 3 (or if the url is scope for \nsome other reason).\n\nmax-speculative hops is the number of speculative hops in a row that \nwill be followed. Strings that are found in javascript that look like \nthey could be urls are considered speculative hops, as well as a few \nother similar things.\n\nmax-path-depth yes is what you assumed.\n\nSo, none of these really have to do with scoping to one domain. That \npretty much happens by default. But if you want to very strictly limit \ncrawling to only the seed domains, you can set max-trans-hops to zero.\n\nNoah\n\nOn 12/16/2012 10:34 PM, cstadler18 wrote:\n&gt; I am trying to spider all pages on a domain that ONLY belong to that domain or a domain in the initial seeds.txt file.\n&gt; Unfortunately I was not able to get any documentation that properly explained all the &#39;hops&#39; options.\n&gt;\n&gt; * max-hops: ?\n&gt; * max-trans-hops: ?\n&gt; * max-speculative-hops: ?\n&gt; * max-path-depth: ?
