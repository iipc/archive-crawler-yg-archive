Handling of cookies is done by default.\n\nThe load cookies option allows an operator to pre-load existing cookies file (in the Netscape&#39;s \nformat.) Specified load cookie-file is pre-loaded before the first document fetch.\nFYI: If your are an IE user you can use File- Import Export wizard to export IE cookies to the \nNetscape format.\n\nThe save cookies option allows an operator to specify a file where the cookies will be saved to \nafter the crawl is done. Only non-expired cookies stored during the crawl will be saved to this file.\n\n&gt; When the crawler runs - does it save cookies recieved and deliver them \n&gt; again?\n\nYes, the crawler is keeping a state of all cookies.\n\n&gt; I crawled a specific site: http://www.hkhkronprinsen.dk - The crawl went \n&gt; fine - but when I look at the material all HTML-files has PHP-errors in \n&gt; the top (session-ID-error originating from either missing or alternated \n&gt; cookie)\n\nCould you please provide more info. Maybe an excerpt of one of these pages. HTTP headers would be great.\n\n\n&gt; Does cookies undergo some character-encoding?\n\nNo. Cookies handling is done via HTTP headers and to my knowledge http headers are not encoded.\n\ni.\n\n\ni.\n\n"}}
