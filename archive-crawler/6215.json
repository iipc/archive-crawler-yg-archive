While launching \n&gt; Heritrix&#39;s WUI and setting up a job, the CPU usage is about 4%. Strting \n&gt; a crawl job with several seeds quickly raises CPU usage to about 99%. \n&gt; However, pausing the crawl job does NOT reduce the CPU usage. Even more \n&gt; surprisingly, terminating a crawl job does not reduce the CPU usg. Only \n&gt; when Heritrix WUI is shut down does the CPU usage return to it was \n&gt; before the crawl job was started.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this a known issue? Am I doing something wrong?\n\nThis is not a known issue, on MacOS or elsewhere.\n\nWhat JVM version and Heritrix version?\n\nUsing &#39;jstack&#39; against the Java process a few times in succession may \ngive a hint as to what Java thread(s) are still busy during a period \n(such as after job termination) when there should be little to no activity.\n\nI&#39;m not sure if the threads of a MacOS JVM are individually viewable in \nthe Activity Monitor (for example with the &#39;All Processeses, \nHierarchically&#39; view), but if so, it may be possible to correlate the \nActivity Monitor PID with one of the thread IDs in the jstack dump, and \nthus be certain which thread(s) are busy.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
