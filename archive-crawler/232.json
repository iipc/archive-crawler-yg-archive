What would be \na good thing to do?\n\nI thought about starting by writing some junit tests, and additional \njavadoc for some low-level utility code, such as the org.archive.util \nand org.archive.crawler.util packages.  This would let me get to know \nthe code a bit better. Would this be a good/useful thing to do.\n\nFor you information, I&#39;m a java developer with a lot of experience of \nbuild systems, and testing frameworks.  (and I worked on some web \ncrawler stuff a long time ago (it was in Perl in 1994 !) and have had \ninterests in the area ever since.)\n\nCheers,\n\njames.\n-- \nJames Casey\nhttp://jamesc.net/\n\n\n"}}
