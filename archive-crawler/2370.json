(We also believe\nthat the many sites which switch their content based on &quot;Mozilla/&quot;\nUAs are worth spidering!)\n\nAs far as I know, the holders of the Mozilla trademark have\nnever objected to the use of their mark for this compatibility\npurpose, with such use dating back at least 9 years to Internet\nExplorer 1.5/2.0 in 1996.\n\n(Further, at least under US trademark case law, there&#39;s a\npotentially relevant precedent which suggests even mimicking\na competitor&#39;s trademark, at the risk of misleading people,\nis legal -- if it&#39;s the only way to achieve otherwise-lawful\ncompatibility. [Sega vs. Accolade, 1992] So even if the easygoing\nfolks over at the Mozilla Foundation wanted third-parties to\nstop this long-established practice, they might not have a\nlegal case. Of course, I am not an IP lawyer and you&#39;d want to\ncheck with your own if this were an area of concern.)\n\nFinally, note that User-Agent is a Heritrix setting that&#39;s\noverridable on a per-domain basis. If a specific web publisher\nrequests you crawl them with a different UA, you can accomodate\nthem, if desired.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nMarco Baroni wrote:\n&gt; Dear Heritrixers,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just received the following mail (my user agent string actually has \n&gt; Mozilla/5.0 since that is the default in heritrix...)\n&gt; \n&gt; I was wondering:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Are the concerns of this person justified?

I have noticed that your wacbot sends the following user\n&gt; agent string:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; wacbot +http://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/wacbot)\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you aware that this infringes on the Mozilla people&#39;s trademark?\n&gt; It&#39;s also a generally bad thing for the internet to go around\n&gt; pretending you&#39;re someone else.\n&gt; The user agent string you should be sending would preferably look\n&gt; something like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; wacbot/1.0 (+http://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/wacbot)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m not affiliated with Mozilla, but would just like to ask nicely\n&gt; that you change it.\n&gt; I understand that some sites treat browsers differently if they have\n&gt; the word &quot;Mozilla&quot; or &quot;compatible&quot; in the UA, but honestly those\n&gt; sites aren&#39;t worth spidering anyway, and their numbers are so few\n&gt; that a purpose such as yours (linguistics) would be almost unaffected.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
