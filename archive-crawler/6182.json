The &#39;queued&#39; URIs are from a host that is sometimes =\r\nslow. However the host is not totally non-responding.\n\nI am targeting only =\r\n1 site and somewhere in the middle the crawl &#39;SNOOZES&#39; forever! I have chan=\r\nged the retryDelaySeconds to 180\nand maxRetries to 3. \nHere is the snoozed =\r\nqueue details.\n\n-----=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D SNOOZED QUEUES =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D-----\nSN=\r\nOOZED#0:\nQueue com,freep,www, (p1)\n  8583 items\n   wakes in: 1m22s228ms\n   =\r\n last enqueued: http://www.freep.com/article/20091115/NEWS02/911150518/1004=\r\n/news02/Signatures-OKd-on-petitions-to-oust-4-officials-in-Van-Buren-Townsh=\r\nip- \n      last peeked: http://www.freep.com/article/20091115/NEWS02/911150=\r\n518/1004/news02/Signatures-OKd-on-petitions-to-oust-4-officials-in-Van-Bure=\r\nn-Township-\n   total expended: 5424 (total budget: -1)\n   active balance: -=\r\n2424\n   last(avg) cost: 1(1)\n----------------------------------------\n\nMy q=\r\nuestions are:\n1)The server is definitely responsive but little too slow. Is=\r\n there a way I can increase the server_response_wait time to 2 or 3 minutes=\r\n so that Heritrix spends little more time tying to fetch it? Or can I force=\r\n bypass the URI creating blockage at the queue front?\n\n2)I read the frontie=\r\nr queue budgeting https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Frontie=\r\nr+queue+budgets \nI am not sure if I understood the concept. Why my active b=\r\nalance is -2424? I read ...when the balance goes non-positive, the queue is=\r\n again deactivated...\n\nThanks for any insights!\n\nRegards,\nPranay\n--- In arc=\r\nhive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The &#39;queu=\r\ned&#39; URIs are almost certainly on some hosts that are not \n&gt; responding.
