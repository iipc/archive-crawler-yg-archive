I\n&gt; am wondering is there any setting that I can tell heritrix that for\n&gt; example\n&gt; http://www.siteA.org and http://www.siteA.extra.org is the same. \n&gt;\nWould adding a canonicalization rule that equates the two work for you? \nBoth siteA.org and siteA.extra.org will have to be in scope.  Add a \nregex rule that equates siteA.extra.org to siteA.org. See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#urlcanon for more \non Canonicalization.\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; In this case siteA and .org is the key, so I want is if I mention\n&gt; siteA.org in the seed file and if the crawler encounter\n&gt; siteA.extra.org along the crawl, first priority is to treat\n&gt; siteA.extra.org as Site scope (so I won&#39;t be missing data), and second\n&gt; priority it is good if i can treat siteA.extra.org as same object as\n&gt; siteA.org so I won&#39;t have duplicate data in arc file.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Any input would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thx in advance\n&gt; Jay\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
