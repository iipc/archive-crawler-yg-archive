I have my startup script written as recommended\n&gt; with the proper classpath in the proper order. Everything seems to be\n&gt; in order except I always get the ServerCache error for any domain or\n&gt; ip address I try to crawl.\n\nWhat is ServerCache error?\n\n&gt; The box is not running anything else and\n&gt; is not firewalled. (I thought for a moment that my firewall was\n&gt; giving Heritrix a hard time but that seems unlikely, I just wanted to\n&gt; get that out of the way before asking for help.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I am counting on Heritrix to feed a knowledge refinery before the\n&gt; weekend. Perhaps there is an issue with my crawl order? Could someone\n&gt; post or send me a domain scope crawl order that is known to be\n&gt; working? I can fill in the seeds. The order I have uses no pre-fetch-\n&gt; processors, another post suggested eliminating this part of the chain.\n&gt;\nThis is probably your issue.  You&#39;ll need the Preselector and \nPreconditionEnforcer that are the usual occupants of the \npre-fetch-processor step.\n\nTry using an order based off one of the profiles setting user-agent and \nfrom and supplying a couple of seeds.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; I would like to lend a hand developing, I like the architecture and\n&gt; plan to be using it for a few projects but I have to get some crawls\n&gt; running first.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you in advance any help will be greatly appreciated,\n&gt;\n&gt; Brian M.
