I&#39;ve mostly seen it on \nsystems being driven by php scripts.  heritrix asks for robots.txt but \nrobots.txt does not exist and instead of the server just saying so with a \n404 error, it returns a 301 or 302 (sometimes even to another host)   the \nresulting page after the redirect (with a 200 return code) is a nice \nfriendly message from the php script that is full of URLs of things you \nmight want to visit instead of the document you asked for.\n\nwe cant fix every poorly designed web site out there so I&#39;m suggesting mods \nto heritrix instead.\n\nI&#39;ve done a simple workaround (using a normal regexp filter) that filters \nout any page with a name containing .*404.*  . 404.php shows up often \nenough that it must be an example in a popular book.  The problem is that \nit&#39;s not always that obvious.\n\ndifferent issue, but related.   maybe another mod we should consider is to \nnot extract links from documents named robots.txt.  that would be pretty \neasy now that all the extractors are looking at that value that says the \ndocument has been extracted.  But this might be the opposite of what \nInternet Archive would want.  Some of the fake robots.txt files are like \nsite maps.\n\n  At 06:42 PM 2/9/2005, you wrote:\n\n&gt;Dave Skinner wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m noticing a phenomena that I dont like\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; some of the dot php sites will return an redirected error page full of\n&gt; &gt; links when trying to fetch robots.txt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How about changing things so if there is a redirect on robots.txt it does\n&gt; &gt; not follow the redirect...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; anyone see any problems?\n&gt;\n&gt;Can you send over sample URLs and why this is causing you distress\n&gt;Dave?
