I followed to\n&gt; message1276 &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1276&gt;\n&gt; from the FAQ, but the attached SimpleHreitrixLauncher.java wasn&#39;t\n&gt; stored. I&#39;m just trying to make Heritrix for some time from my app.\n&gt; There&#39;s a snippet from my source:\n&gt;\n&gt; CrawlJobHandler admin = new CrawlJobHandler(new File(jobsDirPath));\n&gt;\n&gt; CrawlJob jobTemp = admin.getJob(&quot;20060222120757781&quot;);\n&gt;\n&gt; CrawlJob newJob = admin.newJob(jobTemp,null,jobName,description, \n&gt; seeds, 0);\n&gt;\n&gt; admin.addJob(newJob);\n&gt; admin.startCrawler();\n&gt; Thread.sleep(90 * 1000);\n&gt;\n&gt; admin.stopCrawler();\n&gt; admin.deleteJob(admin.getCurrentJob().getUID());\n&gt; admin = null;\n&gt;\n...\n&gt;\n&gt; 23.02.2006 20:04:59 org.archive.crawler.framework.ProcessorChain &lt;init&gt;\n&gt; INFO: Processor: FrontierScheduler --&gt;\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.postprocessor.FrontierScheduler\n&gt; Exception in thread &quot;StartNextJob&quot; java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:\nThe Heritrix jar must be first on the CLASSPATH.  It provides alternate \nimplementations of a few of the httpclient classes.\n\nAlso, regards embedding, I&#39;d suggest that if possible, you should try to \nnot be so intimately involved with Heritrix.  These internal APIs are \nlikely to change making your embedding of Heritrix brittle.  The direct \ncreation of CrawlJobHandler with calls to #getJob is how our Danish \ncompaï¿½eros embed the crawler.  They did it this way because at the time \nthere was no other means available to them.\n\nSince then we&#39;ve added a public &#39;remote control&#39; API available via JMX. \nI&#39;d suggest you use the API since it is more immune to change (Least, \nwe&#39;ll be more careful making changes on this interface.  Services \nrunning here at the Archive depend on it being constant so we&#39;re even \nless likely to change it).\n\nIf there is JMX Agent running in the current JVM, any created Heritrix \ninstance will register itself there.  Thereafter you can go via the JMX \nAgent to add jobs, get status, destroy Heritrix -- has the advantage \nthat you use the same interface whether local to the same JVM or remote \nin another instance -- or you can bypass the JMX Agent and invoke \ndirectly on the Heritrix instance the public methods that JMX itself uses.\n\nHere is list of operations available on JMX API (Its followed by \navailable attributes): \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#293.  \nHere are the operations being invoked: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#1998 \n(Good for figuring how to bypass JMX Agent).\n\nFor illustration, here is how the Heritrix instance is created in webapp \ncontext: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/WebappLifecycle.html.  \nIf you read the Heritrix code, you&#39;ll see that internally we&#39;re doing \nthe same model.  In this class, its just easier to see whats going on.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
