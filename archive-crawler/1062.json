I could only add a couple of\n&gt;general ideas. You mention that you judge a new software version by\n&gt;two things:\n&gt;\n&gt;* crawler behaviour \n&gt;* reports and log files produced by the crawl\n&gt;\n&gt;But it could be worthwhile to look at the stuff that has been\n&gt;downloaded. How well the crawler has downloaded difficult file types,\n&gt;like streaming media or files that were generated from complex script\n&gt;urls =&gt; Are the downloaded files complete and usable. I remember some\n&gt;national libraries (Australia?) have written papers about how\n&gt;different harvester software manage to download unusual file types.\n&gt;Your url list &#39;many_seeds.txt&#39; contains quite strange looking sites \n&gt;that should produce lots of problematic file types. \n&gt;\n&gt;(But maybe it&#39;s quite difficult at the moment to grab any individual\n&gt;files out of heritrix archive files for testing purposes)\n&gt;\n&gt;Do you have estimates on the number of files that your test servers\n&gt;contain = can you say for sure that you can get about 100% from any\n&gt;arbitrary server&#39;s contents, or 95%, or 80% or some other coverage. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The Archive Web Group had a meeting here this morning and hashed out\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;the \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;following rough release plan.  We thought the list would be\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;interested \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;to hear what was decided.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We&#39;ll probably make a 1.0.6 with a fix for &quot;[ 1028913 ]\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;End-of-crawl \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;reports no happen (Stuck StatLogger): \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=det\n&gt;ail&aid=1028913&group_id=73833&atid=539099&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;this week or early next week (We&#39;re still trying to figure why no \n&gt;&gt;reports at the end-of-crawl).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We&#39;re planning to code-freeze a 1.2 release around October 1st. \n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;We&#39;ll \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;then run it through our test cycle which comprises generally of a\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;week \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;of test crawls followed by a week of production crawls (A rough\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;Test \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Plan can be found here: \n&gt;&gt;http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CrawlTestPlan).  1.2\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;will \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;have the priority 8 and above features from the RFE list which can\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;be \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;found here: \n&gt;&gt;https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102.
