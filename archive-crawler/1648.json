Then \n\nthe crawler will exclude those files you don&#39;t need before it \n\nconducts the pre-fetch-processing. I think it is a quite \n\neffecient way to exclude files. It works well in my \n\nexperiments.\n\nGood luck,\nYan\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ozimmels&quot; &lt;oz.heritrix@s...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; so - heritrix filters are &quot;filter out&quot; filters.\n&gt; \n&gt; what would be the best way to only get links of a certain type.\n&gt; \n&gt; given a site : \n&gt; http://some.domain.com/ as the seed\n&gt; \n&gt; i want to crawl only links that match .*reg1.* and .*reg2.* etc ..\n&gt; what would be the best way to do that ?\n&gt; \n&gt; ( i&#39;ve seen suggestions such as .*(^(reg1)).* \n&gt; is there a better way.\n&gt; \n&gt; AND MOST IMPORTANT : \n&gt; where would be the best place to put this filter and why ?\n&gt; \n&gt; what are the other options:\n&gt; additionalScopeFocus ? \n&gt; Preselector ? \n&gt; Preprocessor ? \n&gt; fetch-processors ? \n&gt; extract-processors ? \n&gt; write-processors ? \n&gt; \n&gt; and why ?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; where is the best way to place this filter.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
