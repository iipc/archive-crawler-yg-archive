The=\r\n archive would exist only for that reason - to make certain some content di=\r\nd not go to the great digital trash can in the sky. I would only need to cr=\r\nawl these sites once a year or so as they contain relatively timeless conte=\r\nnt (how to wire a Boston Whaler boat, for instance)...\n\nThe archiving progr=\r\nam or a post-processor must have the ability to convert dynamic sites (foru=\r\nms, etc.) to static pages which would run without dependencies. \n\nSo, my in=\r\nitial questions:\n\n1. What would be the best crawler or SW to use to do this=\r\n? I&#39;ve seen stuff like httrack and heretrix as well as some small programs =\r\n(sitesucker, etc.) which run on a mac, etc.\n\n2. Will advanced configuration=\r\n be needed for each and every site I desire to download? Further to this qu=\r\nestion, have folks written extensions which, for instance, might be designe=\r\nd to best download a site which runs on VBB (a popular forum package)....or=\r\n do we each have to reinvent the wheel?\n\n3. Further to #2, do y&#39;all work wi=\r\nth other programs to massage the data afterwards....as an example, strip ou=\r\nt the ads, etc.?\n\nI run a dedicated centos server which could run the crawl=\r\ner...or, I could run it on my home machine or another barebones server whic=\r\nh I hook up at home. Given the relatively small number of sites I intend to=\r\n archive (probably only 200-300 a year at first), this might work out.\n\nAny=\r\n and all advice appreciated. I would like to avoid as many errors and misst=\r\neps as possible.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
