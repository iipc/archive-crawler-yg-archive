I=\r\n have been\nalso seeing some extractors code, and LinksScoper, but I still h=\r\nave\nmany questions on this topic, as:\n\n- How is the correct way to add a li=\r\nnk in an extractor processor?\n\n- What are context and hopType for?\n\n- Is it=\r\n correct to add a CandidateURI instead a Link in an extractor\n(with replace=\r\nOutLinks)? If not, why? If yes, should them be created\nwith createCandidate=\r\nURI, or with its constructors (creating an UURI\nfirst)?\n\nWhere can I find s=\r\nuch information? Is there a document where is\nexplained how links are added=\r\n, when are transformed, what is context\nand hopType, etc?\n\nI need that info=\r\nrmation, because I have to write a customized\nextractor, that will extract =\r\nPOST links from forms, and those\ngenerally are to be downloaded with differ=\r\nents parameters. I think\nthat code won&#39;t be of interest to Heritrix, becaus=\r\ne is not so generic\n(lot of input data, specific to particulars sites, are =\r\nneeded to\nperform this tasks), but if you think it could be used, just tell=\r\n me.\n\nThanks very much,\n\ntizo\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
