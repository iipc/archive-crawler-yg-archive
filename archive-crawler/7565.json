The previous release, 0.90.3, removed these\nfeatures\nby mistake when upgrading to the latest version of HBase and Heritrix.  A\nWARC\nPooling implementation was being used previously and now the WriterPool is\nbeing used once again.  Thanks to Greg Lu for catching this and submitting\na patch.\nFor this reason we recommend all users should upgrade to 0.90.4.
