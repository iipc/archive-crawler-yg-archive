If anyone considers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it useful, finds any bugs or any major design-shortcomings feel free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to report.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It basically performs all the tasks that ExtractorHTML does - plus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; filling out FORMs default values. The form handling part might still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not be perfect but seems to work just fine in my environment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Olaf Freyer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also started work on a custom extractor based on HTMLExtractor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My primary goal is to be able to fill out FORMs with default values.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I decided to not take the &quot;regular expression&quot;-way as the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HTMLExtractor currently does, but base my work on jerichoHTML parser\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (http://jerichohtml.sourceforge.net \n&gt; &lt;http://jerichohtml.sourceforge.net&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://jerichohtml.sourceforge.net \n&gt; &lt;http://jerichohtml.sourceforge.net&gt;&gt;).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The current results seem quite promising (it is just a few percent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slower than the HTMLExtractor but uses significantly less memory and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it passes all unit test that HTMLExtractor does).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If everything fares well I might be able to provide my extractor to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cummunity next month.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Olaf Freyer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
