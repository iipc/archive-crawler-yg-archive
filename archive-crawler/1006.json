The error log is as follows.\n\nWell, the error says that the read timed out --- can you get the\nrobots.txt file from your browser or from wget?\n\n&gt; My another questioin is, how about if there&#39;s no robots.txt? it seems,\n&gt; in the normal setting, if there&#39;s no robots.txt for a server, the html\n&gt; pages on it will not be crawled. \n\nNo. If there is no robots.txt then it is assumed that the server&#39;s\nadministration has no objections to being crawled, so everything is\nfair game.\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
