You might \ncheck the archive.\n\nIn short, not without doing some work.  Lesser work would be a filter \nthat skipped non-text/html content after download.  More work would be a \ncheck that interrupted crawls mid-download if the type was other than \nwhat you wanted. \n\nThough sub-optimal, you could try and write a regex that only excludes \nresources with URIs that match a particular pattern.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
