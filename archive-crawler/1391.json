Comment lines begin with &#39;#&#39;.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I view the settings after setting some seeds, however, it says,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Seed list too large to edit&quot; under seeds, with the words &quot;seed list&quot;\n&gt; &gt; linking to what I put in the seeds box.  This happens even if we only\n&gt; &gt; list one seed.  What is going on?\n&gt; \n&gt; This is probably the result of a recent bug fix in HEAD.\n&gt; \n&gt;   [ 1102755 ] seeds text area truncates seeds; big seed lists break config\n&gt;   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1102755&group_id=73833&atid=539099\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem that motivated the change is that the browser textarea\n&gt; cannot contain very large seed lists -- in fact in some cases a large\n&gt; list sent back from the server will cause long pauses or rendering\n&gt; problems on the &#39;settings&#39; page, and lead to a textarea with truncated\n&gt; contents.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the settings page does display, and is then resubmitted, you can\n&gt; wind up inadvertently losing seeds you&#39;d previously entered.\n&gt; \n&gt; To guard against this, code was added to disable the textarea\n&gt; display for seed lists &gt; 32K. That limit is arbitrary; I could\n&gt; not find a definitive reference for practical browser implementation\n&gt; limits in this regard.\n&gt; \n&gt; You shouldn&#39;t see this problem listing a single-seed, unless you&#39;ve got\n&gt; a ton of non-URL content (comments?) in your entry.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are seeing it with tiny seed lists, there&#39;s a bug in the fix.\n&gt; \n&gt; More generally, the method for entering and changing seeds needs\n&gt; reworking to better support large seed lists via the web UI.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
