Heretrix is often running into an Out of Memory\n&gt; error. I dont recall seeing this error with an older version of\n&gt; heretrix v1.8 that I had running for quite sometime.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am running it on a 64 bit machine. And the version of java I am\n&gt; using is j2se_jdk_sun-1.5.0.07. I have the heap size set to 3Gigs\n&gt; (-Xmx option.). Does anyone have any ideas on how to resolve this?\n&gt; Should I try running it with a 64 bit JVM, so I can specify a larger\n&gt; heap? \n\nWere you using the exact same JVM (esp. heap) and Heritrix (esp. \nProcessors and UriUniqFilter) options in 1.8? How long does it take to \nOOME?\n\nA problematic issue with our DNS library using an ever-growing amount of \ncache memory was resolved between 1.8 and 1.10.2, so I would have \nexpected fewer OOMEs in long-running crawls, rather than more.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n(1) Since you have 8GB, a 64bit JVM and larger heap could help -- but it \ntends not help as much as you think, because 64bit object pointers mean \nit takes a large heap to hold the same number of objects. (One estimate \nI&#39;ve seen not specific to Heritrix&#39;s heap: 40% larger heap needed for \nsame number of 64bit JVM objects.)\n\n(2) Not all OOMEs are really caused by main heap depletion -- some other \nresource/memory-space depletions also cause OOMEs. Some of these other \ndepletions can be *worsened* by growing a heap closer to an addressing \nceiling. If you have a OOME that&#39;s easy to reproduce quickly, you may \nwant to try running under a 1.6 JVM -- its OOME errors are more \ndescriptive, and there are other options for examining the heap (see \nhttp://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/trouble/TSG-VM/html/memleaks.html#gbywi) \nafter the OOME.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Yahoo!
