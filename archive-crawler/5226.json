I\n&gt; have revissed other questions in this mailing list and I have tried to\n&gt; login against the following URIs that I´ve seend:\n&gt; https://www.redhat.com/wapps/sso/login.html\n&gt; http://www.mangosproject.org/forum/index.php?act=Login&CODE=00\n&gt; \n&gt; In RedHat login form I´ve logged without problemas but in\n&gt; MangosProject I can not. My settings for MangosProject are:\n&gt; \n&gt; credential-domain=string, www.mangosproject.org\n&gt; form-items=map, java.lang.String\n&gt; form-items:referer=string,\n&gt; http://www.mangosproject.org/forum/index.php?s=39cdfa6d9ef87327a4c732b03e169325&amp;amp;act=Login&amp;amp;CODE=01&amp;amp;CookieDate=1\n&gt; form-items:UserName=string, myuser\n&gt; form-items:PassWord=string, mypass\n&gt; form-items:CookieDate=string, 1\n&gt; form-items:submit=string, Log me in\n&gt; form-method=string, POST\n&gt; login-uri=string,\n&gt; http://www.mangosproject.org/forum/index.php?act=Login&CODE=00\n&gt; \n&gt; What is happening?\n&gt; I have seen that in this URI are two forms, this has anything to do?\n\nI suspect the &#39;referer&#39; value may be an issue.\n\nThe &#39;s&#39; parameter looks like a session value that is likely to have \nexpired by the time the crawler tries its login.\n\nAlso, the &#39;&amp;&#39; encoding is likely an artifact of the place where you \ncopied the value. Including it in the login-form-submission may confuse \nthe server.\n\nI made a test account, and left off the &#39;referer&#39; and &#39;submit&#39; \nform-items entirely, and seemed to login OK. (I was redirected back to \nthe forums entry page, and the HTML showed me &#39;logged in as&#39; my test \naccount name.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
