If anyone consi=\r\nders\nit useful, finds any bugs or any major design-shortcomings feel free\nt=\r\no report.\nIt basically performs all the tasks that ExtractorHTML does - plu=\r\ns\nfilling out FORMs default values. The form handling part might still\nnot =\r\nbe perfect but seems to work just fine in my environment.\n\nRegards\n  Olaf F=\r\nreyer\n\n\n&gt; I also started work on a custom extractor based on HTMLExtractor.=\r\n \n&gt; My primary goal is to be able to fill out FORMs with default values.\n&gt; =\r\nI decided to not take the &quot;regular expression&quot;-way as the\n&gt; HTMLExtractor c=\r\nurrently does, but base my work on jerichoHTML parser\n&gt; (http://jerichohtml=\r\n.sourceforge.net). \n&gt; The current results seem quite promising (it is just =\r\na few percent\n&gt; slower than the HTMLExtractor but uses significantly less m=\r\nemory and\n&gt; it passes all unit test that HTMLExtractor does).\n&gt; If everythi=\r\nng fares well I might be able to provide my extractor to\n&gt; the cummunity ne=\r\nxt month.\n&gt; \n&gt; Olaf Freyer\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
