It occurs that s=\r\nome\ndomains needs specials configurations and I&#39;m doing this with\nRefinemen=\r\nt (one for each site that has this need). \n\nBasically these refinements are=\r\n made to restrict the crawler by a URI\nRegExp. When a URI matches the regul=\r\nar expression it will not be crawled. \n\nBut I&#39;m having troubles with this a=\r\npproach, because a great number of\nalerts are being generated. The alerts a=\r\nre 2 (they appear many times\nduring a job):\nSEVERE   \t  if-match-return(in =\r\nprocessor LinksScoper)\nSEVERE   \t  enabled(in processor LinksScoper) \n\nI&#39;m =\r\nhaving memory&#39;s troubles (java heap space exceeds) and I think\nthese alerts=\r\n may be the cause. At this moment there are more than\n500.000 alerts. \n\nSo,=\r\n anyone could help me solve this problem? Or how can I modify the\nheritrix.=\r\nproperties file to don&#39;t launch these alerts?\n\nThanks in advance! \n\nAndr=E9=\r\n Lanna\n\n\n\n\n"}}
