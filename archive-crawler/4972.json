I guess\n&gt; was doing something wrong.  I think I was trying to get the SheetManager\n&gt; for &quot;ready-jobname&quot; instead of &quot;active-jobname&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Still, is there any way to get the crawl controller instance prior to\n&gt; launching the job, or does it not exist until launchJob is called?\n\nThey don&#39;t exist until the job is active.  Prior to that, modules are\nstored as org.archive.settings.Stub placeholders.  So instead of\nroot:controller being a CrawlController, it&#39;s a Stub&lt;CrawlController&gt; in\nthe ready job.\n\nYou can configure profiles and ready jobs, but you can&#39;t operate on them. \nEg, it doesn&#39;t make sense to pause a ready job.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d\n&gt; like to be able to add some listeners and be 100% sure that they will be\n&gt; added before the crawl begins.  In other words, I want to set everything\n&gt; up before the crawl begins, then fire & forget.\n\nYou can set the CrawlController&#39;s pause-at-start to true.  The job will\nthen launch in a paused state, and you can add the listener before you\ninvoke requestCrawlStart.\n\n-Paul\n\n\n"}}
