Looking at the\n&gt; source, it looks like I have to implement the class. After I\n&gt; implement the class (e.g. iplookup.class), what should I fill in for\n&gt; Implementation? Should it be iplookup or iplookup.class?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, where should I keep this class file? Should I copy this class\n&gt; file to the DecideRule folder? Is rebuilding necessary?\n\nAre you using a Heritrix 1.14.x release, or an H3 release?\n\nYou do need to provide your own class implementing \nExternalGeoLookupInterface.\n\nIn H1, by looking at ExternalGeoLocationDecideRule, I can see that you \nspecify the lookup class by full class name (eg: \n&quot;com.example.geo.LookupInetAddress&quot;), it must have a constructor taking \na single String parameter (which is supplied the &#39;countryCode&#39; value of \nExternalGeoLocationDecideRule). If the class is anywhere on the \n&#39;classpath&#39; of the launched crawler, it should be found.\n\nIn H3, the lookup class is instantiated in the Spring-based \nconfiguration file like any other bean. That is, you can supply its \nclass name and constructor/setter-based configuration in any of the ways \nallowed by that configuration format. The class will be found if \nanywhere on &#39;classpath&#39; of the launched crawler. (Additionally, using \nthe Spring configuration&#39;s option to create new implementation classes \nwith scripting languages, it&#39;s even possible to implement the \nlookup-class inline in the configuration file.)\n\nIn neither case is a full rebuild required -- only that the new class be \nfindable on the classpath when referenced. Still, if you&#39;re developing \nand debugging your new class to match the declared interface, you will \nprobably want/need to have a development setup capable of building \nHeritrix, just to be able to iteratively write/test that new class.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
