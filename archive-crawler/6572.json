Just to confirm, what configuration apart from deduplication=\r\n uses information from previous crawls. I have not enabled deduplication fo=\r\nr my crawls.\n\nIf you want I can send across my configuration.\n\n&gt; Are you us=\r\ning a default configuration, or can you reproduce the problem \n&gt; with a def=\r\nault configuration?\n\nI have a slightly modified default configuration. I ha=\r\nve enabled parallel queues, reduced maxHop paths value and modified politen=\r\ness policy.\n\nAlthough the fewer URI crawled issue arises many times after a=\r\n restart I have not always got it after a restart. So I assume something is=\r\n not being killed gracefully and hence the issue arises.\n\n\n&gt; Starting with =\r\na fresh jobs directory, can you describe exactly what \n&gt; steps in what orde=\r\nr results in a less-than-full crawl?\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n\n* My Herit=\r\nrix jobs directory is in /opt/heritrix_jobs.\n* My actual job directory( whe=\r\nre I store the job folder) is in /mnt/websites/\n* When I start a job I copy=\r\n a job from the profile configuration and add a job path to the heritrix jo=\r\nb folder.\n* I then build and launch the job and wait for it to get over.\n* =\r\nThis works perfectly fine until a restart.\n* One more thing of interest is =\r\nthat once URI count goes low for one URL all the URLs that I crawl yield a =\r\nlower URI count than they should actually.\n\n\n&gt; Is the PID file only created=\r\n the first time Heritrix is launched, then \n&gt; never updated?\n\nYes the pid f=\r\nile is only created at launch and never updated.\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Are you always laun=\r\nching as the same user? What OS are you using?\n&gt; \n\nYes I always launch a jo=\r\nb as the same user. I am using Ubuntu 9.10 i686.\n\n\nThanks,\nPrashant Katare.=\r\n   \n     \n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the pid file issue:\n&gt; \n&gt; Is the PID file only cr=\r\neated the first time Heritrix is launched, then \n&gt; never updated?\n\n&gt; - Gord=\r\non @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; On 6/7/10 5:04 AM, katare_glg wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n     I am using Heritrix 3.1.1 version. When I start Heritrix for the first=\r\n time a pid file is created. So when I need to restart Heritrix I kill the =\r\nprocess with the pid from the heritrix.pid file.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now next time onwa=\r\nrds the pid file is not updated. So I just issue a killall -9 java command =\r\nto stop Heritrix.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I do this and restart Heritrix I have observ=\r\ned that the numbe of pages fetched by Heritrix goes down sometimes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n For example: I have a website which has around 270 pages. But on restartin=\r\ng Hertirix by killing it sometimes gives me just 36 pages.\n&gt; &gt; The count re=\r\nmains low until I restart Heritrix by killing it a couple of times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Any reason for this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Prashant Katare.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
