I am using Heritrix =\r\n2.0.2\nand have successfully installed/run simple crawls. Now, I only want t=\r\no\nsave particular types of content to save space/bandwidth. For\ninstance, I=\r\n don&#39;t need any media content. I&#39;ve seen the Tom Emerson&#39;s\nblog on the topi=\r\nc\n(http://www.dreamersrealm.net/~tree/blog/?s=3Dtext%2Fhtml&submit=3DGO) as=\r\n\nwell as the FAQ entry but these seem tailored for the 1.* versions of\nheri=\r\ntrix. I can switch back and follow the directions but wanted to\ngive 2.0 a =\r\nshot. I am guessing that I need to institute a rule under\nthe Scope-&gt;Rules-=\r\n&gt;list of decide rules.\n\nThe logical one to pick would be the &quot;MatchesRegExp=\r\nDecideRule&quot;. I then\nplace the regex filtering the unwanted extensions, move=\r\n the rule up in\nthe list and set the decision to &quot;reject&quot;. I noted in Mr. E=\r\nmerson&#39;s\nblog that he also filtered the saved content. Is there a comparabl=\r\ne\nway to do this in Heritrix 2? Is this the intended mechanism by which\nI s=\r\nhould be filtering content? Thank you for the time and effort both\non the c=\r\nrawler and reading my question,\n\nPeter\n\n\n"}}
