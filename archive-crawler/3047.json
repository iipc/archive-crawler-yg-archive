I am wondering however if we leave the central frontier \n&gt; machine concept out for a bit, would there be anybenfit to split URL \n&gt; space in place of Split Architechture.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt; I am trying to do quick big crawl, hence wondering which approaches \n&gt; are the best ways to get moving.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you&#39;re in a hurry, split URL space (and throw hardware at it).  Some \nfairly large crawls have been achieved using this technique both by us \n-- 200million plus -- and by others (See the testimonial cited in the \nprevious where Joe Hung and his compaï¿½eros did a 1Billion+ pages).\n\nWhat were you thinking regards splitting the architecture?\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
