As far as I can see this option is not supported.\n\nSecond possibi=\r\nlty would be to to crawl only first site of an external URL so the DNS chec=\r\nk will be made automatically with option &quot;alsoCheckVia&quot; turned on. But how =\r\ncan I limit this to only 1 external site?\n\nI hope you can help me with this=\r\n problem.\n\nThanks in advance,\nMarkus\n\n\n"}}
