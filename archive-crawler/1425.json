I&#39;m doing unit tests on Heritrix as part of our project, and\n&gt; there noticed that running Heritrix several times in a row used a lot of\n&gt; memory, about 100M per run.  I found a memory debugger for Java\n&gt; (http://jb2works.com/refscan/) &lt;http://jb2works.com/refscan/%29&gt; which \n&gt; showed me one thing that was in the\n&gt; archive packages and linear in the number of Heritrix runs:  The\n&gt; loggers.  For each run, there is one instance of each of\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.io.LocalErrorFormatter,\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.io.RuntimeErrorFormatter,\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.io.StatisticsLogFormatter,\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.io.UriErrorFormatter, and\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.io.UriProcessingFormatter, and 5 of\n&gt; org.archive.io.GenerationFileHandler.  Can&#39;t go much further as I don&#39;t\n&gt; have my system set up for compiling Heritrix, but maybe this will be\n&gt; useful to somebody.\n\nThank you for the above Lars.  We were keeping around references to the \njob loggers.  I&#39;ve just added clearing of the references at end of job \ncompletion.  I did some more end-of-job housekeeping while I was at it.  \nThere are still some processors that should register for end of job \ncleanup but I won&#39;t worry about them for now since memory retained is small.\n\nI&#39;ve not experienced Heritrix holding 100megs per job -- at least not \nsince close of &#39;[1055592 ] terminated crawl still hogging memory, \ncausing OOM&#39; \n(https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1055592&amp;group_id=73833&amp;atid=539099)\nThis bug was fixed post-1.2.0 release on 2004-12-10 so fix is currently \nonly in HEAD.  I can run at least ten jobs in series without OOME&#39;ing in \na 128meg heap.  For sure there is a problem if you&#39;re seeing 100megs \nretained per job.  Lets try and figure it out.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; -Lars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
