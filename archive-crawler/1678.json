I\nam wondering is there any setting that I can tell heritrix that for\nexample\nhttp://www.siteA.org and http://www.siteA.extra.org is the same.  \n\nIn this case siteA and .org is the key, so I want is if I mention\nsiteA.org in the seed file and if the crawler encounter\nsiteA.extra.org along the crawl, first priority is to treat\nsiteA.extra.org as Site scope (so I won&#39;t be missing data), and second\npriority it is good if i can treat siteA.extra.org as same object as\nsiteA.org so I won&#39;t have duplicate data in arc file.\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThx in advance\nJay\n\n\n\n\n"}}
