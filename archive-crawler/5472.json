I opened port 8849 (for JMX) on the remote\nmachine, but if I try to connect via a local web GUI, the connection\nis always refused.\n\nBy running netstat -altp I&#39;ve seen that Heritrix opens 3 ports: 8849\n(JMX), and two others that change everytime I launch Heritrix. If I\nopen one of these two ports (in addition to 8849), then I can connect\ncorrectly...\n\nSo my question is:\n\n* Why does Heritrix use 3 ports? Why does it need those?\n* How could I configure my firewall to access the remote crawl engine\ncorrectly since the additional ports change at every reload?\n\nAnyone can help with this?\n\nJean-Noel\n\n"}}
