Thus, that queue \nwill make very slow progress.\n\nHowever, all other queues should proceed as rapidly as ever, unless \naffected by similar blocks. If Heritrix appears to be crawling nothing \nover hours, then all queues with remaining URIs must be in a similar \nslow-failure, long-wait state.\n\nSo, I&#39;m not sure what to consider the &#39;problem&#39; to resolve. The crawler \nhas discovered real URIs and requested them. The site has decided to \nstop accepting connections from your IP. If you configure the crawler to \ncrawl more slowly, it might not trigger the connection-refusal-logic.\n\nIf the URIs were truly of interest, you could appeal to the webmaster to \ndisable the block, or try crawling from another IP address.\n\nIf the URIs are really junk, and the crawler is just spinning trying to \nfinish queues of defunct or otherwise connection-refusing sites, perhaps \nyou just want to end the crawl.\n\nHTH,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nnfoscarini wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m having a problem with a crawl I&#39;m running.

It points to one of those reserved domain name pages, and not\n&gt; a real wesbite.\n&gt; \n&gt; Something like the JS extractor created this URI.\n&gt; \n&gt; My problem is that the server is returning 302 status for all the URI,\n&gt; but after requesting about a 100 bad URIs the server starts refusing\n&gt; connections. This appears to get Heritrix stuck, because it just sits\n&gt; there for hours not crawling.\n&gt; \n&gt; What can I do to help resolve this problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible for Heritrix to detect this kind of problem and then\n&gt; remove the seed?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
