That helps.... I am looking for continuous crawling\nfuncti=\r\nonality which I believe is being developed on 2.x ( correct me\nif I am wron=\r\ng ) ...I am trying to set up my dev environment in\nnetbeans..I will post th=\r\ne instructions if I am able to figure it out :-)\n\n\nFew more questions:\n1) I=\r\ns there a way to add new urls/seeds to a crawl job without\nstopping the cra=\r\nwl ? If yes, when will the seeds get crawled...Any\npointers in the document=\r\nation or code would be helpful...\n\n2) Are you talking about the UI changes =\r\nas mentioned @\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Conti=\r\nnuous+Recrawling+Phase+A+Design+Notes\nor are there more changes\n\n\nThanks\nKa=\r\nnnan\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; ckannanck wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi All,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am a newbie to heritrix..I c=\r\nhecked out the latest stable version of\n&gt; &gt;  Heritrix 2...and I tried to de=\r\nbug the crawl process step by step...\n&gt; \n&gt; For a beginner, the 1.14.x code =\r\ncould be a better place to start -- the \n&gt; documentation is better, and the=\r\nre are still significant \n&gt; UI/configuration changes planned in the 2.x lin=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; My Attempts & and the end results:\n&gt; &gt; 1)I tried setting up the d=\r\nebugger ( using netbeans ide..can use\n&gt; &gt; eclipse if necessary) on the WebU=\r\nI...but this limits me to step\n&gt; &gt; through only the UI code... I am unable =\r\nto step through the actual\n&gt; &gt; crawl process.. \n&gt; &gt; 2)Tried to debug the ma=\r\nin method of the\n&gt; &gt; org.archive.crawler.Heritrix.java ... the debugger end=\r\ns its session at\n&gt; &gt; the end of the main method ( since the main thread sta=\r\nrts\n&gt; &gt; sleeping).subsequent actions on the webui does&#39;nt get followed...\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Can somebody  help me with this problem and also wondering what is =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; best way to understand the program flow....(besidees the developer =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; user manuals) \n&gt; \n&gt; Heritrix developers use step debugging in Eclip=\r\nse all the time, in \n&gt; 1.14.x and 2.x, so it&#39;s definitely possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\nen I launch from Eclipse for debugging, for Heritrix 1.14.x, my \n&gt; command-=\r\nline options include as a VM option &quot;-Dheritrix.development&quot;, \n&gt; setting a =\r\nsystem property that prevents Heritrix from redirecting \n&gt; STDOUT/STDERR to=\r\n a log file and changes slightly how configuration info \n&gt; is found.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhen I launch from Eclipse for debugging, for Heritrix 2.x, my \n&gt; command-li=\r\nne options to the Heritrix class include &quot;-w \n&gt; webui/src/main/webapp&quot; to p=\r\noint to my IDE_compiled classes for the\nwebui \n&gt; (rather than the default W=\r\nAR).\n&gt; \n&gt; In either case, because Heritrix uses a pool of worker threads to=\r\n\nhandle \n&gt; each URI in turn, and crawls are typically launched/controlled v=\r\nia\nshort \n&gt; transaction in webui webserver threads or other short-lived \n&gt; =\r\nspecial-purpose threads, attempting to step through activity from the \n&gt; ma=\r\nin() thread will not be helpful. Instead, I would add breakpoints at \n&gt; oth=\r\ner key methods to catch and observe operations of interest.\n&gt; \n&gt; To summari=\r\nze, for your purposes, I would recommend:\n&gt; \n&gt; - As a newbie, start with He=\r\nritrix 1.14.x -- for now it&#39;s better for \n&gt; getting started. (Though, you c=\r\nan still use 2.x if you want.)\n&gt; - Use Eclipse -- I expect NetBeans would w=\r\nork but I&#39;m sure Eclipse\nwill, \n&gt; and the source from project SVN is alread=\r\ny arranged as an Eclipse\nproject\n&gt; - Set breakpoints rather than trying to =\r\nstep from the main() launch\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
