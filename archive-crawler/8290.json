I have been waiting for 21 threads to\n&gt; finish for 2 days now and am thinking of just killing them off. Is\n&gt; the queue at all affected if threads are killed half-way through?\n&gt; Mainly, I care if the thread hold large amounts of information about\n&gt; the current crawl state and thus would heavily affect the crawl\n&gt; integrity. Niels\n\nKilling a thread via the ToeThread.kill() method tries to be safe, \naborting the URI in progress as a failure and telling the ToeThread not \nto proceed any further.\n\nBut, depending on the exact cause/position of the stall, and whether the \nToeThread is doing anything else (especially anything involving custom \ncomponents/state), it might not be completely clean.\n\nCan you say more about the relevant ToeThreads&#39; current state?\n\nWhat Heritrix version, and what does a thread stack dump show?\n\nStandard config and behavior should make network fetches time-out much \nearlier, so there&#39;s something unique (perhaps an undiagnosed/unnoticed \nerror?) if you have threads that seem to stuck doing the exact same \nthing for many hours.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
