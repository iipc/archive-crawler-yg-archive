Redirects (e.g. 302) are not counted so sites with a lot of redirects go way beyond the specified limit. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen over 800Mb from a single host with a 10Mb limit\n&gt; \n&gt; Its the same weather the QuotaEnforcer is the first or last module in the processor chain\n&gt; \n&gt; Are redirects treated in a special way that never gets their content size summed up with all other URIs ?\n\nTallies per host, server, and group (queue) are kept for both &#39;successBytes&#39;\n(200 response codes) and &#39;totalBytes&#39; (any response code) -- see\nCrawlStateUpdater.innerProcess() and CrawlSubStats.tally().\n\nBut, QuotaEnforcer currently only offers an option to set quotas on\nthe &#39;success&#39; byte counts. (This is by design, though the help descriptions\nin the settings page are misleading.) It was thought that usually,\nsuccesses are the figures of most interest, and non-success data would\nusually be small in comparison. Clearly, though, you&#39;ve hit some sites\nwhere this isn&#39;t the case.\n\nAre these sites dominated by crawler trap chaff, or is there some\nintended pattern of redirects/other-responses that has generated\nsuch a giant success-vs-total size discrepancy?\n\nI&#39;ve created an RFE to add QuotaEnforcer max settings for the &#39;total&#39;\ntallies:\n\n  [ 1393254 ] &#39;total&#39; bytes/fetches quota options in QuotaEnforcer\n  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1393254&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\nIt&#39;s a pretty simple addition that I&#39;ll get into CVS HEAD in the next\nweek or so.\n\nThanks for the problem report!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
