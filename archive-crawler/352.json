I somehow think a running series\n &gt; number in an archive implies that no two files in an archive have\n &gt; identical s-numbers (even if their timestamps differ)\n\nWhen I run repeating crawls I usually name arc files so that is easy to tell which arcs belong to \nwhich crawl. For example:\n\nname-weekly-00 - 00001 - timestamp1 - IP.arc.gz\nname-weekly-01 - 00001 - timestamp2 - IP.arc.gz\nname-weekly-02 - 00001-  timestamp3 - IP.arc.gz\nname-weekly-03 - 00001 - timestamp4 - IP.arc.gz\n\nwhere xx in name-weekly-xx- represent week number.\n\n &gt; S-number makes file names more unique but it&#39;s not very informative.\n &gt; Would it be possible to use job name instead\n &gt;\n &gt; OperatorGivenName - Jobname - Timestamp - IP.arc.gz for example =&gt;\n &gt;\n &gt; finland - photoarchives - timestamp - IP.arc.gz\n &gt;\n &gt; Slight problem of course that job names have variable lengths unlike\n &gt; s-numbers.\n\nAll this can be achieved with using descriptive arc names. For example:\n\nfinland-photoarchives00-00000-timestamp-IP.arc.gz\nfinland-photoarchives00-00001-timestamp-IP.arc.gz\nfinland-photoarchives01-00000-timestamp-IP.arc.gz\nfinland-photoarchives01-00001-timestamp-IP.arc.gz\n\nwhere &#39;finland-photoarchivesXX-&#39; is a arc name prefix.\n\nAlso, I believe that we are going to swap positions of series# and timestamp. This way we can easily \nsort arc files by date which in some cases can help determine which arcs belong to which crawl.\nExample where an operator have used same arc prefix for multiple crawls:\n\nCONGRESS-20040124024708-00000.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124024925-00001.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025035-00002.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025146-00003.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025230-00000.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025250-00001.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025353-00002.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025531-00003.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025656-00000.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025750-00001.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124025849-00002.arc.gz\nCONGRESS-20040124030003-00003.arc.gz\n\nSo simple by sorting arc names and observing increasing series number we can find out which arcs \nbelong to which crawl.\n\ni.\n\n"}}
