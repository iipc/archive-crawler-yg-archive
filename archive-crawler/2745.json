By any chance, is this \ncrawl =\r\n\n&gt; based on a checkpoint recovery and perhaps you switched Heritrix \n&gt; vers=\r\nions subsequently?  (While, the Heritrix class versions \nhaven&#39;t \n&gt; changed=\r\n recently, the bdbje lib was recently updated).\n\nWe just started the produc=\r\ntion crawl --- 8 crawlers each is equipped \nwith 3TB storage (yeah I took y=\r\nour suggestion seriously, plenty of \ndisk space for each crawler).\n\n&gt; What =\r\nchanged Joe?  The hw and the kernel?  Any chance of reverting \nto \n&gt; your h=\r\nardwon stable-config?\n&gt; \n\nHardware changed. We&#39;ve got duel-core AMDs with 4=\r\nGB memory machines \n(cf. single P4 HT in the proof crawler). Same OS and Sa=\r\nme VM (_05).\n\nOne thing I&#39;m doing now is to switch the VM to run on &quot;-clien=\r\nt&quot; \nmode. So far all 8 crawlers are on &quot;-client&quot; mode for more than 24 \nhou=\r\nrs without hotspot error. I&#39;ll keep my fingers crossed.\n\nWithout specifying=\r\n &quot;-client&quot; or &quot;-server&quot; options with starting the \nVM, on the proof machine=\r\n the default is &quot;-client&quot; and the production \nmachines is &quot;-server&quot; by defa=\r\nult. I wonder maybe the &quot;-server&quot; mode \nis just not as stable as the &quot;-clie=\r\nnt&quot; mode.\n\nCheers,\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
