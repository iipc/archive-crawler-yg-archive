I have trained the Bow\nclassifier to recognize pages relevant to the topic. Now I want to\nhook up this trained classifier to  Heritrix in such a manner that\nHeritrix consults this classifer before following any link. In short I\nwant to add a URL to frontier only if it belongs to the topic (if the\nscore returned by the classifier meets a minimum threshold value)  \n\nIs there a way to accomplish above task?\nplease let me know if anything is still unclear or not properly\nexplained by me.\n\nBest,\n\nSaurabh\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
