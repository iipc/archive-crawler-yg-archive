We used\nto determine it using an old crawler we have. We&#39;d like to use\nheritrix to do the same thing, but I dont know what in the API I use\nto determine how far a page is from the starting page. Some one had\nmentioned hopsfilter class, but I really dont understand it or have\nany proper documentation to go by. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRegards,\nAhnu\n\n\n"}}
