I&#39;ll contact you offlist to get more \ndetails and make sure you can reach the right people.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\npranay wrote:\n&gt; I have two requirements:\n&gt;  1) a list of URLs (with scoping specified) needs to be crawled.\n&gt;  2) I need the list to be crawled within a reasonable and specific time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Based on these two parameters, can I get a rough cost estimate from IA for my crawl? What factors are considered before a cost-estimate is offered to the client or will I be given the estimate only after the crawl is over. Then also I would be interested in knowing the cost and what factors influence it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Pranay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
