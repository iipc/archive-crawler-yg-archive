I had to move them out of the way to finish\nthe build via Maven.\n\nAlso, if the AList changes we&#39;re playing with take hold, it\nmight be good to leave getAList() visible, but deprecated,\nfor backwards compatability.  There might be lots of code\nout there that invoke this method on the CrawlURI.\n\nAnd, as I stated in my last post, it would be nice to have \na  &quot;protected CreateCandidateURI(CrawlURI c)&quot; method in the\npostprocessors.\n\nRegards, D.
