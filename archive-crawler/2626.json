I =\r\nwant to \nknow\n&gt; &gt; if 6KB/s is an acceptable bandwidth? We have a tight sche=\r\ndule and \nwant\n&gt; &gt; to crawl at the fastest possible.\n&gt; 6KB/s seems low.  Ho=\r\nw many threads are you running?  Are they all \n&gt; occupied all the time?  Ha=\r\ns the crawl just started or is the 6KB/s \na \n&gt; measure taken after crawling=\r\n a while.  What kind of hardware and \nwhat is \n&gt; theoretical upper bound on=\r\n the pipe you are using?\n&gt; \n&gt; On fairly basic hardware with 200 threads, mi=\r\nnutes after startup \ndoing a \n&gt; broad crawl, a megabyte per second and high=\r\ner is not unusual.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, I understand that Heritrix only limits =\r\na crawl of 1 uri per \nhost\n&gt; &gt; at a time for politeness. Is it possible to =\r\ncircumvent this since \nwe\n&gt; &gt; have the permission of the web owners to craw=\r\nl their website?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Not currently.  The model of one-URI-per-host-at-a-t=\r\nime is fairly \ndeeply \n&gt; ingrained.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aside from above, what could be =\r\nthe reason for the slow crawling? \nThe\n&gt; &gt; following is the result when I u=\r\nse TOP in unix.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cpu(s):  0.3% us,  0.2% sy,  0.0% ni, 99.3% id,  0.=\r\n0% wa,  0.2% \nhi, \n&gt; &gt; 0.0% si\n&gt; &gt; Mem:   1035664k total,   945060k used,  =\r\n  90604k free,    91592k \nbuffers\n&gt; &gt; Swap:  2040244k total,   128092k used=\r\n,  1912152k free,   252684k \ncached\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your top seems to =\r\nshow your crawler idle most of the time (If I&#39;m \n&gt; reading it correctly).  =\r\nStudy the crawler reports, particular the \nthread \n&gt; reports.  Are they all=\r\n just in wait all the time?  How many hosts \nare \n&gt; you crawling?  One?  If=\r\n so, only one thread will be active against \nthat \n&gt; host.  Have you played=\r\n with the min-delay-ms settings changing it \nfrom \n&gt; default of 2000?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nSt.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; &gt; Computer security \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?\nt=3Dms&k=3DComputer+security&w1=3DComputer=\r\n+security&w2=3DComputer+training&c=3D2\n&s=3D46&.sig=3DBHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWD=\r\ng&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?\nt=3Dms&k=3DC=\r\nomputer+training&w1=3DComputer+security&w2=3DComputer+training&c=3D2\n&s=3D4=\r\n6&.sig=3Dv0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n------\n&gt; &gt; YAHOO!
