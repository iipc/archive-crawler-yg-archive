This may not always do what the user expects.  For example, the \nURLs members.aol.com/bigbird and members.aol.com/~bigbird will put any URL \nthat starts with members.aol.com into focus.  To prevent this, use a form \nlike members.aol.com/bigbird/ or members.aol.com/bigbird/index.html instead.\n\n\n\nDave Skinner   dave at solid dot net\n    High Performance Programming---assembly (lots of them), C, java, perl\n    Database and Non-trivial web site implementations\n    Real-time and embedded systems are my specialty\n\n\n\n"}}
