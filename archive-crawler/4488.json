Running the crawler in Eclipse, I traced the\np=\r\nroblem to HttpClient&#39;s URI constructor, where URLs are absolutized. \nHttpCl=\r\nient strips the URL back to the last path segment, but in the\ncase of query=\r\n parameters, it is not treating the ? as a directory-like\nseparator.  Brows=\r\ners, IE and Firefox do this.  \n\n\nI have tried upgrading the HttpClient 3.01=\r\n jar to HttpClient 3.1-RC1,\nbut this did not fix the problem.\n\nI am using t=\r\nhe latest Heritrix code from the SourceForge SVN repository.\n\nI have issued=\r\n a bug report for HttpClient,\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLI=\r\nENT-679\n\nAny help / thoughts would be appreciated.  I am going to download\n=\r\nHttpClient&#39;s source tonight and see if I can&#39;t create a patch.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
