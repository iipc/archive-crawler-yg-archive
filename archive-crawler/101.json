(The &quot;dns:&quot; URI\n  is considered already-fetched, and thus will not be \n  fetched again.) So from the 24-hour mark on, the logs show\n  only &quot;unable to fetch because a prerequisite is unavailable&quot;\n  errors. \n\nAnother bug noted: our timestamp-writing routine is using\n12-hour based times, so 11:59pm is showing as 1159 rather than \n2359, and 12:59am is showing as 1259 rather than 0059.\n\nThe logs and ARCs for comparison against Mercator and HTTrack\nare available on crawl09:/0/crawls/test-gojomo/8hosts/\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
