What&#39;s the best approach?\n\nMy c=\r\nurrent method has been running a SurtPrefixScope with a\nBdbFrontier.  I use=\r\n a QueueTotalBudget of 200 (there are usually more\nthan 200 seeds per domai=\r\nn), with a HostnameQueueAssignmentPolicy, and\nUnitCostAssignmentPolicy.  In=\r\n order to keep the memory use down and to\nallow me to get as many seeds spi=\r\ndered as possible, my current\napproach has been using the JMX client to slo=\r\nwly feed seeds into the\nsystem (1500 at a time), watching for when the curr=\r\nent speed drops and\nfrontiers are being completed before adding another bat=\r\nch of seeds. \nIn a previous JMX client version, there was a flag somewhat a=\r\nkin to\nforce download of seeds, which allowed me to continue adding seeds f=\r\nor\nqueues that were already retired (at least, I think), though that&#39;s\neith=\r\ner no longer an option, or no longer working with my current JMX\nwrapping a=\r\npplication (which I haven&#39;t updated for the JMX client\n0.10.4 from 0.8).\n\nI=\r\n have a custom WriteProcessor which outputs statistics about the\ndownloaded=\r\n pages needed for my application.  I&#39;m only interested in\ngetting the actua=\r\nl HTML, not in any binary types (I already have\nvarious filters in place to=\r\n faciliate this).  The machine is a dual\nprocessor Athlon 64, running CentO=\r\nS 4, with 2G of ram.  Its sitting on\na rack where I have permission to pull=\r\n down 15Mbs.\n\nJust hoping to get some feedback from the Heritrix pros about=\r\n whether\nI&#39;m taking the right approach to solving my problem.  My first goa=\r\nl is\nto spider all 7 million seeds.  The second goal would be to do some\nsp=\r\nidering of on-domain pages linked to by those seeds (to discover\npossible n=\r\new seeds).\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\n-matt\n\n"}}
