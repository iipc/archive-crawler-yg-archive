After a \ntotal failure, as long as the disk with the checkpoints (and other \ndesired crawler state) is still available, you can re-launch from the \nlast checkpoint. (Whatever paths were crawled between the last \ncheckpoint and time-of-failure will be refollowed. Whether you get \nduplicates in your permanent logs/storage is up to your own processes \nfor moving things around, whether happening constantly or only after \ncheckpoints.)\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 11/9/11 11:50 AM, crawltst wrote:\n&gt; Hi If System fail (Network down, System reboot ,Power line problem,\n&gt; Hardware problem,...), does Heritrix3 resume crawling from where the\n&gt; system failed?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
