I assume I have=\r\n a leak somewhere in the custom processors.\n\nHere is the spring-conf file:\n=\r\nhttp://pastie.org/545485\n\nI dont use most of the default processors, but in=\r\nstead have two custom processors:\nMySQLScheduler - does almost exactly what=\r\n FrontierScheduler does, but also schedules pre-collected URL&#39;s from a data=\r\nbase with the frontier.\nMySQLWriter processes the pages fetched and stores =\r\nthe necessary parts into a MySQL database.\n\nWhere are ROS and RIS files ope=\r\nned and where are they closed within the heritrix processor-chain? Because =\r\nI&#39;m assuming, as I&#39;m not using most of the built-in processors, I am missin=\r\ng the part where these files should be closed.\n\nHere is the tail of lsof -p=\r\n #h3_process\nhttp://pastie.org/545492\n\nAny suggestions are highly appreciat=\r\ned!\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\nKing regards,\nIkrom\n\n\n"}}
