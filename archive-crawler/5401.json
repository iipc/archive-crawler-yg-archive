The size boundary I had set was 700kB \n&gt; with 150ToeThreads.\n&gt; Most of the time this was working fine - but at least once per week I \n&gt; ran into those OOMEs.\n&gt; \n&gt; The major reason behind the jericho based HTML extractor for me was \n&gt; improved form handling -\n&gt; an experimantal feature I tested that was sending default form \n&gt; values/fields. It worked promising\n&gt; on a small scale - but the risk of getting into serious trouble wasn&#39;t \n&gt; worth it. (Most shop owners aren&#39;t\n&gt; too happy  about a web crawler endlessly filling shopping carts...)\n&gt; \n&gt; It might be worth exploring the options of wrinting a new HTML extractor \n&gt; - based on some\n&gt; other HTML parser that works with streams and doesn&#39;t require to loader \n&gt; the complete document at once.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt;   Olaf Freyer\n&gt; \n&gt; Christian Krumm schrieb:\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have a question concerning the function getContentSize() in the class\n&gt;&gt; ReplayInputStream. The Java Doc indicates that the function will return\n&gt;&gt; the total number of content.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So does the function deliver the total number of bytes in the content of\n&gt;&gt; this Steam?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Background:\n&gt;&gt; To reduce OOME within the HTML-Parser, I want to only handle files which\n&gt;&gt; aren&#39;t to big. I already exclude non html Documents. But sometimes the\n&gt;&gt; crawler still gets an OOME and crashes. Adding pause-on-finish doesn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; seem to help. I can&#39;t continue the crawl after an OOME.\n&gt;&gt; So I plan to only handle files which have content smaller than 30kb.\n&gt;&gt; Or is this a to big/ small value?\n&gt;&gt; Perhaps I may also restrict the maximum size of the header to 1kb?\n&gt;&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot\n&gt;&gt; Christian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
