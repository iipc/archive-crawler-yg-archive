I just tried this with a simple order file \nand it crawled and exited fine.\n\nWhat do the logs say?  Is the crawler still working on an URL?  Does the \nprogress-statistics.log have a line that says something like \n&#39;20040825184719 CRAWL ENDED - Finished&#39; in it?\n\nIs the heritrix process still running?  Is it just your java launcher \nthat is hung?\n\n&gt;&gt;When I ran it manually, I noticed that it would just say &#39;Starting\n&gt;&gt;Heritrix...&#39;, and would keep writing a dot and never stop. My question\n&gt;&gt;is, how do I crawl a site and than once the site is crawled the\n&gt;&gt;heritrix process shuts down. I could have sworn that the same command\n&gt;&gt;use to provide that function, but it seems now it just hangs instead.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Ahnu\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I hate replying to my own message, but I wanted to update it. It\n&gt;appears that the shell script that launches heritrix is hanging, now\n&gt;the java application.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThis looks to be a different problem.  Look in heritrix_out.log.  There \nis probably a report on why the app is unable to start.\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
