The source code, documentation and other information, including a quick start manual are available from http://netarchive.dk/suite\n\n\nAbout the NetarchiveSuite\nThe NetarchiveSuite is the complete web archiving software package developed within the netarchive.dk project from 2004 and onwards.\nThe primary function of the NetarchiveSuite is to plan, schedule and run web harvests of parts of the Internet. It scales to a wide range of \ntasks, from small, thematic harvests (e.g. related to special events, or special domains) to harvesting and archiving the content of an \nentire national domain.\nThe software has built-in bit preservation functionality.\nThe systems architecture allows for the software to be distributed among several machines, possibly on more than one geographical location.\nThe NetarchiveSuite is built around the Heritrix web crawler, which is fundamental for the NetarchiveSuite behavior in harvests of the web.\nYou find more overview information on the NetarchiveSuite website.\n\n\nHow to see and evaluate the NetarchiveSuite\nTo see and evaluate the software in a simple setup, you can register and follow the Quick Start Manual. This manual contains all needed \ninformation to get a simple test system up and running on a standard linux machine.\n\n\nAbout libraries behind the NetarchiveSuite\nThe State and University Library of Denmark and The Royal Library of Denmark is responsible for collecting and archiving material \nencompassed by legal deposit legislation in Denmark. The oldest law on legal deposit legislation in Denmark is from 1697. The latest \nrevision of the law is from 2004. This extended the material encompassed by the law to include the Danish Internet as well.\n\n\nImportant links related to the NetarchiveSuite:\nWebsite: http://netarchive.dk/suite\nNetarchive Team: webarkivering-teknik@...\nWorkshop 6th-7th Sep. 2007: http://netarchive.dk/suite/WS_sep_2007\n\n\nPS: Sorry for cross posting.\n\n\nBest regards\n-- \nBjarne Andersen\nDaily Manager - netarchive.dk\n\nState & University Library\nUniversitetsparken\nDK-8000 Aarhus C\nT: +45 89462165 - C: +45 25662353\nCVR/SE 10100682 - EAN 5798000791084\nhttp://netarchive.dk\n-- \nBjarne Andersen\nDaily Manager - netarchive.dk\n\nState & University Library\nUniversitetsparken\nDK-8000 Aarhus C\nT: +45 89462165 - C: +45 25662353\nCVR/SE 10100682 - EAN 5798000791084\nhttp://netarchive.dk\n\n\r\n--Boundary_(ID_FIXmeLmTgZv60e3rAIWQOg)\r\nContent-type: text/x-vcard; charset=utf-8; name=bja.vcf\r\nContent-disposition: attachment; filename=bja.vcf\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Boundary_(ID_FIXmeLmTgZv60e3rAIWQOg)--\r\n\n"}}
