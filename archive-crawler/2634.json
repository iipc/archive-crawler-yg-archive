Some sort of notification mechanism (or protected \nmethods from where we can send notifications) would be of great help.\n\nWe were trying to  figure out a way to reduce allreadySeen&#39;s  \nevergrowing size. And one of the approaches we are trying to explore is \nthat when a queue gets exhausted we can delete all the URLs (of the \nexhausted workQueue)  and either add an entry for the  host (effectively \nhost/*) or keep a separate exhausted queue.\n\nprasenjit\n\ngojomo@... wrote:\n\n&gt;Look for the call to clearHeld() in WorkQueueFrontier: that&#39;s the\n&gt;point where the queue is no longer actively &#39;held&#39; by the other\n&gt;queues-of-queues, because it&#39;s both empty and and its lingering\n&gt;politeness snooze has finished. That&#39;s equivalent to the state\n&gt;counted by the &#39;exhausted&#39; statistic.\n&gt;\n&gt;If this is an important extension point for you, we would consider\n&gt;(a patch?) making this step more prominent by factoring it out of\n&gt;the overgrown next() method.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hope this helps,\n&gt;\n&gt;- Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt;Prasenjit Mukherjee wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Not via UI. I was trying to find out the code section where we could \n&gt;&gt;possibly determine that a particular WorkQueue is exhausted. I looked \n&gt;&gt;into WorkQueuefrontier&#39;s activateInactive(),next() and schedule() \n&gt;&gt;methods but couldn&#39;t figure it out :(\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Any kind of pointer  is very much appreciated.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;thanks,\n&gt;&gt;prasen\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;gojomo@... wrote:\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n\n\n"}}
