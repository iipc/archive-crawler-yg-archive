Is this normal,\n&gt;will mmaven only compile from CVS? Or is it the same\n&gt;source. I followed all the instructions from the dev\n&gt;manual? I just want to know if this is because of the\n&gt;source package I used?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHey Yousef:\n\nYou added the extra plugin and jar file required to build our docbook \nmanuals?
