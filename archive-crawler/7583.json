The new URI will have a &#39;hops-path&#39; (also called pathFromSeed in \nthe source code) that ends with a &#39;R&#39; character, and its &#39;via&#39; \n(immediate predecessor) URI will be the one that redirected to it.\n\nThe usual scoping rules will, via the TransclusionDecideRule, tend to \nrule such URIs in, as long as the number of &#39;R&#39; hops in a row aren&#39;t too \nhigh. However, the overall hop-counting of the TooManyHopsDecideRule \ntreats these &#39;R&#39; hops the same as any others. That is, 2 or 3 in a row \nare treated as 2-3 hops from the seed URI.\n\nA &lt;META&gt; refresh in HTML is handled the same way, as an &#39;R&#39; discovered \noutlink. (The most notable difference from the HTTP redirect case is \nthat an HTTP redirect will only yield one other URI, whereas the rest of \nthe HTML after the refresh will yield whatever other outlinks are there \nas well.)\n\nA Javascript redirect will only be discovered when the URI is findable \nvia our crude pattern-based Javascript link-extraction. In such a case, \nthe outlink is of &#39;X&#39;speculative type, because we don&#39;t analyze the \nJavascript to see how it&#39;s triggering the load (or whether it is loading \nsomething into an embedded region or replacing the main page).\n\nAn &lt;IFRAME SRC&gt; is considered an outlink of &#39;E&#39;mbed type, as it appears \ninline on the page and is required to render the original page. It \ncounts as an extra hop, but is also usually ruled-in by the \nTransclusionDecideRule.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Regards, Zi Kai\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
