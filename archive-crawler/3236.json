For example:\n&gt;\n&gt; Case 1: Suppose you want to crawl only pages from a particular host, and\n&gt; you want to avoid crawling too many pages of the dynamically generated\n&gt; calendar. Here&#39;s how you would use the DecidingScope to setup this \n&gt; crawl...\n&gt;\n&gt; Case 2: Suppose you wanted to only grab 5 pages from each of the 10 the\n&gt; seeds...\n&gt;\n&gt; Case 3: Suppose you only want to crawl URLs that match\n&gt; http://foo.org/bar/* &lt;http://foo.org/bar/*&gt; and you only want to crawl \n&gt; URLs that end with .html...\n&gt;\n&gt; Each of the use cases could point out how the fetchers, extractors,\n&gt; decide rules, canonicalizer, etc. would effect the crawl. This would\n&gt; have been really helpful to me when I was a newbie. :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
