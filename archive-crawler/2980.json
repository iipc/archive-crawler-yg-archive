Seems like this report would be equally\n&gt; useful post-crawl.\n\nAll the reports are written to files at the end of a crawl. In particular,\nthe mime type info is written to &quot;mimetype-report.txt&quot;. So all that info\nis preserved after the end of a crawl even though it isn&#39;t accessible via\nthe web UI.\n\n&gt; 2) Has anyone developed a set of R or GNUplot scripts for processing\n&gt; the ARC files of a finished job? A set of scripts that can plot the\n&gt; distribution of MIME types, URIs, etc.\n&gt; would be really useful to me, and I&#39;ll probably write them myself\n&gt; unless someone already has.\n\nNot that I know of. If the crawl.log contains all the necessary\ninformation it would probably be simpler and more efficient to parse it\nrather then the ARC files. In either case I&#39;m sure that many others would\nbe interested in such statistical analysis tools should you choose to\nwrite and share them.\n\n- Kris\n\n\n\n"}}
