It seems like SurtPrefixedDecideRule\ncould be extended with a max-docs-per-surt option?  Or would this need\nto be an entirely seperate Rule?  Seems like this would carry through\nto allow max-documents-per-surt, per-domain, per-host.\n\nGuess you&#39;d need a hash (memory or disk?) based on the SURT to track\ndoc counts for each surt?  The REJECT/ACCEPT conditions would then\nhave to be based SURT match and (max-documents-per-surt = 0 or\nsurt_count &lt;= max-documents-per-surt)?\n\n\n\n"}}
