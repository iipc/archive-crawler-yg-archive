Thus, its native storage format is &quot;ARC&quot; files, which are\nessentially perfect transcripts of the HTTP responses received during\nthe crawl.\n\n(Other crawlers place a higher importance on creating a website\nmirror browseable from the local filesystem, or simply collecting\nraw text for indexing purposes.)\n\nSee this section of the Heritrix Developer&#39;s Manual for more info,\nincluding pointers to some tools for reading/viewing ARCs:\n\n   http://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual.html#arcs\n\n(Other tools for ARC collection viewing are in the works, but none are\nyet as easy to setup as Heritrix itself.)\n\n&gt; Also I&#39;m wondering what happens if links are deleted after a second\n&gt; crawl of the sites?\n&gt; Are they deleted if not exist upon a second crawl?\n\nCurrently, any &quot;second&quot; crawl using the same starting/scope parameters\nis completely independent of any previous crawl: there is no reuse of\nknown info, and even identical materials are crawled all over again.\n\n(An initial experimental facility for revisiting the same material\naccording to a schedule, storing only changed material, and adapting\nthe revisit frequency according to perceived change rates is now\navailable. See:\n\n   http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#arf\n)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
