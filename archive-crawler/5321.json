I included the name in pr=\r\nocessor.options and placed the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; .java file into the writer folder in t=\r\nhe source. Then built heritrix\n&gt; &gt; &gt; using Maven. The new processor does sh=\r\now up on the webUI but the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; processor doesn&#39;t work correctly when I do=\r\n a crawl. I get toethread\n&gt; &gt; &gt; errors, am I doing this wrong? Thanks.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Without knowing the error, it&#39;s impossible to tell. If it&#39;s not \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nomething like &#39;class not found&#39;, and the crawl launched before the \n&gt; &gt; err=\r\nor occurred, it&#39;s probably a bug in your code.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I actually modified the code seen in this article. I&#39;m not sure if its\n&gt; n=\r\not up to date with heritrix 1.14 or something I changed. For the most\n&gt; par=\r\nt I just altered it to accept xml rather than html and got rid of\n&gt; the str=\r\nip tag function and where it was used. \n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/archive-crawler/message/4538\n&gt;\n\nOk, I believe its not recognizing the dri=\r\nver.
