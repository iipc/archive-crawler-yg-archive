I&#39;ve been using heritrix 2.0.3, and I have set it up, everything works fine, however, after a couple of hours it throws the following exception:\n&gt; \n&gt; 2009-06-14T04:20:54.076Z    -2          - http://xxxxxxx.xxx - - unknown #018 - - - \n&gt;  java.io.IOException: ROS already open for ToeThread #18: xxxxxxx.xxx\n&gt;         at org.archive.io.RecordingOutputStream.open(RecordingOutputStream.java:187)\n&gt;         at org.archive.util.Recorder.outputWrap(Recorder.java:168)\n&gt;         at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpConnection.open(HttpConnection.java:759)\n&gt;         at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeWithRetry(HttpMethodDirector.java:387)\n&gt;         at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeMethod(HttpMethodDirector.java:171)\n&gt;         at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:397)\n&gt;         at org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:346)\n&gt;         at org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchHTTP.innerProcess(FetchHTTP.java:446)\n&gt;         at org.archive.modules.Processor.innerProcessResult(Processor.java:157)\n&gt;         at org.archive.modules.Processor.process(Processor.java:123)\n&gt;         at org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchHTTP.process(FetchHTTP.java:680)\n&gt;         at org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.processCrawlUri(ToeThread.java:310)\n&gt;         at org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.run(ToeThread.java:157)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; However, the crawl does not stop. It waits for a single url for about 5 minutes, not doing anything, and the same problem with the next url, etc. The above exception is does not show up in the heritrix_out.log, but only in the nonfatal-errors.log, so I have to stop the crawl manually.\n\nAs this is logged as a &#39;nonfatal&#39; error, if it is the only symptom, it \nshouldn&#39;t be a cause for concern.\n\nIs the real problem that there is no progress in the crawl on URLs you \nexpect to be reachable?\n\nIf so:\n\n  - are there many of these &quot;ROS already open&quot; errors? Do they always \nfeature the same thread number (as #18 above), or same hostname, or do \nthey vary?\n\n  - is there any other error output in the heritrix_out.log or \nalerts.log, around the time progress stops?\n\n  - are you sure the URLs remaining to be crawled are fetchable by other \nmeans? (Usually, a long wait in trying URLs is indicative of some \nfailure to connect to a remote server.)\n\n  - does the problem always recur at about the same interval after \nstart, or against the same hostnames?\n\n  - what do lines in the progress-statistics.log show around the time of \nthe error/stop-in-progress?\n\n  - does the problem recur in 1.14.3?\n\nThis isn&#39;t a known problem, and while it doesn&#39;t look to me like the \n&quot;ROS already open&quot; is a proper state, it might just be a symptom of some \nother issue, and might not be responsible for the lack-of-progress.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
