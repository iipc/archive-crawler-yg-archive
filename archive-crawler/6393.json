I will see if they are useable to\n&gt; me. \n\nOk, after some Testing: The modules are buggy, but I was able to fix\nthem. The bug:  As both PersistLoadProcessor and PersistStoreProcessor\ninherit from PersistOnlineProcessor, they both try to open a database,\nin my case the very same one. This yields to an Exception in the\nBDBModule. Fixed by allowing access if the BDBConfig is the same in all\nParameters. \nPersistOnlineProcessor also closes the Database, leading to an Exception\nwhen the second Processor in Chain tries to close it. Fixed by\nnow relying on BDBModule to close the database. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this is Heritrix 2, NOT 3. Is there still some\nmaintenance for Heritrix 2? Are patches for it welcome?\n\ngreetings \n\nStefan\n\n-- \nStefan Denker                 &lt;sdenker@...&gt;\nBFK edv-consulting GmbH       http://www.bfk.de/\nKriegsstra√üe 100              tel: +49-721-96201-1\nD-76133 Karlsruhe             fax: +49-721-96201-99\n\n"}}
