I&#39;m currently\n&gt; using the SURT:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://(com,example,www,)/\n&gt; \n&gt; This appears in my SURT dump and debug statements.  I have a custom\n&gt; processor, however, and it&#39;s getting CURIs for things like:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://grx.com\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m getting things like that from curi.getUURI().getHost() as well as\n&gt; from curi.toString().  \n&gt; \n&gt; I thought for a second this was because I was using the default list\n&gt; of decide rules from the user manual and the example, as shown below,\n&gt; but I removed both acceptIfTranscluded and acceptIfPrerequisite, and\n&gt; am still getting the above URI crawled.  Am I completely missing\n&gt; something?  How is it possible for me to see the above URI at the\n&gt; processing stage?\n\nIt could be transcluded (if it were referred to by certain short chains\nof hops from other URLs already in-scope), but removing the\nacceptIfTranscluded rule would eliminate that possibility.\n\nIf &#39;http://grx.com&#39; appears in the crawl.log, you can deduce the\nimmediate predecessor URL, and hop-types that reached it, by the\nrespective fields right after the URL in that log.\n\nIf it doesn&#39;t appear in the crawl.log, are you perhaps reading it\nout of the discovered links of another URL, rather than seeing\nit be crawled itself?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
