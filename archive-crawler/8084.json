(For example, any scoping rules \nthat derive their behavior from the seed set, or the seeds report.)\n\nThe TextSeedModule will also notice this announcement, and if the \ntextSource bean implements the WriteTarget interface, try to write the \nnew seed to that target (and if it fails, log/alert a non-fatal \nwarning). The example configuration uses a ConfigFile pointing to \n&#39;seeds.txt&#39;, and ConfigFile is a valid WriteTarget.\n\nSo you could set seedRedirectsNewSeeds to &#39;false&#39;, and the redirects \nwouldn&#39;t be considered seeds at all. There&#39;d be no attempt to write them \nto the file. But also, they or their outlinks might not be in-scope as \ndesired.\n\nIf you wanted to keep promoting the redirects to be considered seeds, \nbut not change the seed file, you could make the seeds.txt file \nnon-writable by the user that launched the crawler process. This would \ngenerate &quot;problem writing&quot; warnings for each redirected-new-seed that \ncouldn&#39;t be written.\n\nYou could also specify the seeds textSource as a ConfigString, inline in \nyour configuration file (or alternatively via a Spring XML &lt;include&gt; \nelement referring to another suitable XML file). Since ConfigString \ndoesn&#39;t implement WriteTarget, again no attempt to append the new seeds \nwould occur... but again there&#39;d be a warning (&quot;nowhere to log added \nseed&quot;).\n\nYou&#39;d have to modify the source of TextSeedModule, or add your own \nReadSource implementation (that implements a no-op WriteTarget) for use \nas the textSource property, if you wanted to suppress the warnings \nentirely.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\nOn 5/13/13 8:13 AM, tereo27 wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; My crawl job is based on the TextSourceModule which announces a list\n&gt; of seeds from a text source.
