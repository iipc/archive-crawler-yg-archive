This part of the \nprogress-statistics shows you&#39;re nowhere near using that up:\n\nmem-use-KB heap-size-KB\n1623524 1642048\n\nTogether with the OutOfMemoryError without a &quot;Java heap size&quot; message, \nthis indicates the problem is not in Java object-space, but some native \nresource or memory pool. Such problems can be made worse by a large \nheap, because that leaves less memory for other JVM activity.\n\nI don&#39;t recall seeing how many threads you&#39;re running with, but each \nthread does require more non-heap memory -- especially if you&#39;ve \nincreased the per-thread stack size (-Xss) for any reason. So if you&#39;re \nusing a lot of threads, reducing the number (or the -Xss value) might \nalso help. (From the single progress-statistics.log line you&#39;ve \nforwarded, the crawler does not look busy.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nanitabidari wrote:\n&gt; Hi Gordan\n&gt; \n&gt; This is regarding the OOME error that I still get after upgrading to\n&gt; heretrix 1.12.0.
