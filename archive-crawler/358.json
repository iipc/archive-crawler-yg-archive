Now I expect to\n&gt; index/random_read created ARC files. After\n&gt; reading/searching for a while, I am still not able to\n&gt; get any program to do this job.\n&gt; So the question might be silly, but I really want to\n&gt; know where and if I can get these tools. And if not,\n&gt; is  it part of future work of Heritrix?\n\nCurrently we don&#39;t have indexing tool within the Heritrix project.\nThis is definitely part of the future work.\n\nYou should take a look at ARCReader.java in org.archive.io.arc package. This class will allow you to \nread through ARC files sequentially and create your own index.\n\nThe tools that we have that chew on arcs files are not open source. At this point we can provide \nthese tools to other nonprofit or library like organizations.\nWe are working on getting these tools publicly available. If that does not work out we are planning \non providing open source alternatives.\n\ni.\n\n\n\n"}}
