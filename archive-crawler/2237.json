I have and just tried everythin=\r\ng except\nupdating the code which I will try in momentarily.  My comments\nfo=\r\nllowing yours.\n\n&gt; (2) At a time when all but 1 of the URLs have succeeded, =\r\ncall\n&gt; up a &#39;Frontier Report&#39;. What is the status of the queue holding\n&gt; th=\r\ne problem URL? If it&#39;s in a multi-minute &#39;snooze&#39;, the topmost\n&gt; URL (which=\r\n may be one of your URL&#39;s prerequisites) was tried and\n&gt; failed and is awai=\r\nting retry. The default settings take many\n&gt; hours to finally give up on an=\r\n URL, since transient network\n&gt; problems are common, and once an URL is mak=\r\nred as &#39;failed&#39;,\n&gt; it is no longer retried.\n\nI just tried with 17 url seed =\r\nfile and 4 of them got that message\n&quot;Seeds has not been processed&quot;.  If i t=\r\nerminate the job and rerun\nagain, I got all of them crawled.  And those 4 p=\r\nroblemtic seed url are\nnot in any of the log file and as well as not in any=\r\n of the queues in\n&#39;Frontier Report&#39;.\n\n\n&gt; (3) Look in the &#39;local-errors.log&#39;=\r\n. Many transient errors which\n&gt; do not mark a URI as &#39;failed for good&#39; appe=\r\nar here. Many resolve\n&gt; with a later retry, but seeing what sort of error i=\r\ns affecting\n&gt; the URL(s) which remain unprocessed could help determine what=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; happening.\n\nI did grep on those url in the log directory, not in any o=\r\nf the files\neven after I stop the crawl.\n\n&gt; Similarly, you could run a test=\r\n crawl with very small\n&gt; Frontier &#39;max-retries&#39; and &#39;retry-delay-seconds&#39; s=\r\nettings --\n&gt; perhaps &#39;4&#39; and &#39;30&#39;. Then, unless the problem is some sort\n&gt; =\r\nof long network hang, all URLs should either succeed or fail\n&gt; within a few=\r\n minutes -- at least getting you error information\n&gt; in the &#39;crawl.log&#39; abo=\r\nut everything.\n\nmy current max-retries is 3 and retry-delay-sec is 2000 and=\r\n\ndelay-factor is 0.  \n\n&gt; (4) Check to see if a substantially similar URL ha=\r\ns been crawled.\n&gt; For example, if you are having problems with &#39;http://exam=\r\nple.com&#39;\n&gt; showing as never-crawled, see if &#39;http://www.example.com&#39; has be=\r\nen\n&gt; crawled. Our default canonicalization rules will consider these\n&gt; the =\r\nsame URL in most situations, and until recently (and perhaps\n&gt; still) certa=\r\nin combinations of URL seed/discovery ordering,\n&gt; redirections, and scope c=\r\nonfiguration can inadvertently keep the\n&gt; &#39;right&#39; variant from being crawle=\r\nd, once the &#39;wrong&#39; variant\n&gt; has already marked the URL as done.\n\nI tried =\r\nas well.  All of my seeds are fully qualified\nhttp://www.xyz.com and as I e=\r\nxplained above, they are not consistent\non one url.\n\nAnd the error is not c=\r\nonsistent, I couldn&#39;t guess when it will happen\nor on what URL.  But mostly=\r\n it is right after the crawler is started.\n Pretty rare in the re-run witho=\r\nut shutting down the crawler.\n\n\nThanks for any of the input.  I&#39;ll try the =\r\nlatest head and update as well.\n\n-- Jay\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
