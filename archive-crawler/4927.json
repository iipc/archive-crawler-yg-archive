Are you &quot;redeploying&quot; production kit? Maybe a fresh production \ndeploy would clear the problem.\n\nDo you have full stack traces for these exception? I think those would \nhelp diagnose the problem. Do you know what heritrix feature WCT is \ntrying to access every 10 minutes via JMX (if any)?\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\nPope, Jackson wrote:\n&gt; Hiya all,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I�m getting some weird behaviour from Heritrix 1.8 running under WCT. \n&gt; This all works on our test kit, but trying to deploy to our production \n&gt; kit we get the following errors, so I doubt it�s a WCT error, but it \n&gt; could easily be a config problem. I�m not sure what I should be \n&gt; checking, the heritrix.home settings look alright, the tomcat user owns \n&gt; the heritrix.home and crawl base directories, but there are no logs and \n&gt; no arcs.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The job is created via JMX and is visible through jconsole, where it is \n&gt; apparently running, however WCT is reporting that it�s in the Preparing \n&gt; state. In the Catalina.out we�re getting a \n&gt; javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException followed fairly swiftly \n&gt; by a javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException, followed by an 11 \n&gt; minute wait and then those two errors again.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone seen anything similar, or got any advice for things to check?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jack\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jackson Pope\n&gt; \n&gt; Technical Lead\n&gt; \n&gt; Web Archiving Team\n&gt; \n&gt; The British Library\n&gt; \n&gt; +44 (0)1937 54 6942\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; **************************************************************************\n&gt;  \n&gt; Experience the British Library online at www.bl.uk &lt;http://www.bl.uk/&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; The British Library�s new interactive Annual Report and Accounts 2006/07 \n&gt; : www.bl.uk/mylibrary &lt;http://www.bl.uk/mylibrary&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Help the British Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
