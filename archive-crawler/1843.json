So far I&#39;ve collected &gt;7 million docs but IO is \nconsistently at &gt;50% using top. Sometimes even higher at 90+%.\n\nHere is what&#39;s interesting...even if I pause the crawl, IO is still \nbusy. The number never dropped.\n\nI&#39;m running on a dual Xeon with a direct attached SCSI array, using \nSun&#39;s JDK 1.4.2. -Xmx1200.\n\nI&#39;ve done a 7 million docs crawl using 1.0.4 before on the same \nhardware (using domainscope though). From what I remember the disk IO \nwas at around 5%. \n\nIs it becuase of BdbFrontier? Any hints?\n\nThanks,\n\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n"}}
