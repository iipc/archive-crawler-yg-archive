(In particular, many URI priorities means many \ndifferent insertion points for varied URIs in a single queue, which \nmeans more disk seeks/less cache efficiency on the queue structures.)\n\n� URIs only get their precedence when initially enqueued; they can&#39;t be \nreprioritized within their queue later. (Queues can have their \nprecedence changed as their size/contents/other-heuristics change.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\nOn 4/15/11 1:50 AM, tashev85 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello Gordon,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am working on a customization of Heritrix and I need exactly those two features. However, I could not find any information on how to use them. Could you please explain in more detail (or point me to the documentation) how to assign priorities to different queues while running a job and how to assign priorities to URIs when they are inserted into the queues.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want your prioritization to also take effect within the standard\n&gt;&gt; Heritrix frontier queues, there&#39;s a (seldom-used) pair of features,\n&gt;&gt; queue and URI &#39;precedence&#39; values, which affect (1) how inactive queues\n&gt;&gt; are sorted while waiting for their chance to be active; (2) where URIs\n&gt;&gt; are inserted into individual queues (if all the other factors which\n&gt;&gt; affect whether they are pushed-near-the-top or queued-to-the-back are\n&gt;&gt; equal).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
