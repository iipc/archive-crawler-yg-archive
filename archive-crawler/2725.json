I&#39;m not downloading nearly the volume of \ndata into my ARC=\r\n files as I was with max-hops=3D20.  However, the \ncrawler will spend a gre=\r\nat deal of time idling, not downloading any \npages.  It will often go a min=\r\nute or more without downloading \nanything.\n\nIt appears to me it must still =\r\nbe evaluating the same number of \noverall URIs as it was before, but just r=\r\nejecting the vast majority of \nthem.  Is this accurate?  I guess I expected=\r\n it would avoid evaluating \nthe same number of URIs because it could reject=\r\n so many right away \nthat are only reachable beyond a certain number of hop=\r\ns.  Given that \ndecide rules only come into play after the crawler has reac=\r\nhed a given \nURI, though, I suspect this is not the case.\n\nAny way I might =\r\nbe able to tweak things so setting the hops that low \nmakes the crawler not=\r\n even consider a huge set of URIs?\n\nSorry if I&#39;m missing something obvious =\r\nhere.\n\nOh, and someone just forwarded me your plugin message to p2p hackers=\r\n, \nGordon.  Cool when these worlds collide!\n\nThanks very much.\n\n-Adam\n\n\n\n\n"}}
