Does Heritrix produce a DAT file aside from the ARC file? Is there \n&gt; an open source tool that can extract the dat file from the arc file? We \n&gt; need the meta data like-contents of the DAT file.\n\nWe don&#39;t have DAT-writing capabilities as part of the Heritrix package.\nThere&#39;s a &#39;--store&#39; option mentioned in the Bnf ARC Tools\n(http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BnfArcTools) that I believe\ncan create DATs; I&#39;ve inquired with the author for more details.\n\n&gt; 2. How does Heritrix verify that the files that it downloaded are not \n&gt; corrupted? Does it use md5 checksum?\n\nThe only guard against corruption during HTTP download is that provided\nby the protocols: TCP/IP checksums (and, when using HTTPS, its integrity\nchecks).\n\nA SHA1 checksum of the HTTP response originally received is taken on the\nfly and stored in the crawl.log for later reference.\n\nOther collection-management systems (completely separate from the crawler)\nmonitor the archived disk files (mainly ARCs) for decay or other corruption.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
