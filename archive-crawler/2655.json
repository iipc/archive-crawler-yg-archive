This is for information only, and if \nsomeone has the time to work on the one issue that I found, that would be \ngreat.\n\nI was able to finish the experimentation of Heritrix on windows and found \nout that it has to do with the DNS Java components. I tried on windows XP, \nwindows 2003 server enterprise edition set up as IIS and DNS servers on the \nnetwork. Debugging the puppy shows that the calls are not making it through \nthe system to the DNS Cache on the windows boxes, while on Red Hat 9.0 which \nI happily had a copy of, the system was up and running in a couple of hours \ncollecting arc files.\n\nEssentially then if I can get DNS Java working on the windows box (which has \nbeen the stumbling point at this time) then I should be able to do a good \ncrawl using Heritrix. No worries there, it is going to be an interesting \ntime if I decide to stay with Linux. Which I probably well because I am time \nconstrained hugely lately.\n\nIf anyone is interested in taking on the DNS Java issue, this information \nshould help, or you can give me a shout and we can go into a lot of \ntechnical information on this one.\n\nJust thought I would share my findings on a non supported Operating System \nand my conclusions.\n\nCheers/r/Dan\n\n\n\n\nSometimes MSN E-mail will indicate that the mesasge failed to be delivered. \nPlease resend when you get those, it does not mean that the mail box is bad, \nmerely that MSN mail is over worked at the time.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIs your PC infected?
