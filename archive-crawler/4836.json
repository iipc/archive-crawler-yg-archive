I  \nsuppose we could try to extend JMX to allow streaming, but there&#39;s  \nalready a mountain of JMX support code in commons, and JMX is, alas,  \nthe standard.\nThat&#39;s why we have Telnet. Just log into the machine, and tail the logs.\n\nThe problem is that Heritrix is always switching log files when it starts a new job. It would be nice to direct all logging to common files.

I can do this with the Apache web server, tell it to limit the log file size to 200K.\n\nAlso for transferring large files like arcs or the crawl.log, you&#39;re  \nbetter off using NFS/SMB. I wouldn&#39;t want to integrate a full WebDAV  \nserver (say) into Heritrix to enable arc removal; those kinds of  \ntasks seem better suited to tools outside of Heritrix.\n\nI don&#39;t think it should be Heritrix&#39;s job.

Once you get into job management, fancy web interfaces, and enterprise services, then it&#39;s just less time spent improving the web crawler.\n\nI like the daemon feeling that version 1.12 had, and I haven&#39;t had much time to play with 2.0 but I hope it still following that pattern.\n\n       \n---------------------------------\nNever miss a thing.
