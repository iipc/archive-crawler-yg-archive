I&#39;ve extracted the\n&gt; arc from .gz, now i want to get all my object files from that arc\n&gt; file. I tried some arc extractor namely Arc, nmarch, etc etc..\n&gt; When i am extracting arc file, it is giving Invalid header error.\n\nDid you see this note from yesterday: \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2282.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; But when i looked up this file using winzip in windows, it was showing\n&gt; all text files but there name were started with a question mark.\n&gt;\nYou looked at the arc with winzip or at the arc.gz file with winzip?  If \nthe former, winzip is the wrong tool -- use a straight windows editor to \nperuse the arc file.\n\n&gt; I am summarizing my problems as\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. i have to send all the retrived files in the text format for\n&gt; indexing. so how should i do it ??????\n&gt;\nYou need to iterate over all the records in the ARC (See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/io/arc/ARCReader.html). \nThen per record, you need to pass it via an appropriate parser switched \noff the record mime type: e.g. if text/html, pass it via something like \njtidy or nekohtml, etc.\n\nHave you looked at nutch?  This might be more appropriate to your task.\n\n&gt; 2. is Heritrix fetching pdf and other format files ?? (when i saw the\n&gt; records while running the crawler it was showing some pdf files in\n&gt; crawl report, but when i am seeing the arc file in winzip, it is only\n&gt; showing the text files).\n&gt;\nBy default, yes.\n\n&gt; 3. Is there anyway so that instead of writing the download file in an\n&gt; arc format, i can save them in their original format??\n&gt;\nCheck out the mirrorwriter processor in Heritrix: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/writer/MirrorWriterProcessor.html\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; I am waiting for your kind help... :-(\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance...\n&gt; Shadab..\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
