I would stick with the 1.x line until 2.2 comes out.\n\nI think I ran into the same problem building heritrix 1.14 as you:\n\nBUILD FAILED\nFile...... /Users/nlevitt/.maven/cache/maven-xdoc-plugin-1.8/plugin.jelly\nElement... attainGoal\nLine...... 687\nColumn.... 48\nThe build cannot continue because of the following unsatisfied dependency:\nqdox-current.jar\n\nI ran &quot;maven -X dist&quot; to get more info, and saw this:\n\nAttempting to download qdox-current.jar.\nGetting URL: http://repo1.maven.org/maven/vdoclet/jars/qdox-current.jar\nReceived status code: 404\nFile not found on one of the repos\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: \nhttp://repo1.maven.org/maven/vdoclet/jars/qdox-current.jar\n\nhttp://repo1.maven.org/maven/readme.html advised me that this url is \nvirtual, and to look at the CentralM1 repository at \nhttp://repository.sonatype.org/index.html. I found qdox-current.jar this \nway at \nhttp://repository.sonatype.org/content/repositories/centralm1/vdoclet/jars/qdox-current.jar. \nIt would appear that the rewriting system for \nhttp://repo1.maven.org/maven/* is at least partially broken.\n\nSo I downloaded \nhttp://repository.sonatype.org/content/repositories/centralm1/vdoclet/jars/qdox-current.jar \nto ~/.maven/repository/vdoclet/jars. After that the build worked. Hope \nthis helps!\n\nAlso, please feel free to email the list about it and/or submit an issue \nto jira (http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER) about the \ndifficulties you&#39;re having with crawling.\n\nNoah\n\n\nstevenkhanderson wrote:\n&gt; Folks,\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m having trouble building heritrix from 1.14.1 and 2 sources.\n&gt; Part of the problem is my unfamiliarity with maven, \n&gt; jelly, qdox, etc.\n&gt; The problems are around &quot;qdox&quot; (version &quot;current&quot; -- which \n&gt; actual version does this correspond to?) and vdoclet (1.2),\n&gt; specifically: \n&gt;\n&gt;  /maven-vdoclet-plugin-1.2/plugin.jelly (line 38)\n&gt; Element... vdoclet:vdocletBean\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps I&#39;ve tried forcing the wrong version of qdox\n&gt; (copied from i&#39;m not sure where) via the override mechanism.\n&gt; If I don&#39;t do this, it doesn&#39;t seem to know where to get\n&gt; qdox-current.jar from (I think someone stopped distributing it).\n&gt;\n&gt; Can someone try building from source, and verify that the\n&gt; release should actually build and download what it needs,\n&gt; and if not provide the appropriate .jars in the release?\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I&#39;m doing this is the version doesn&#39;t seem to spider\n&gt; yahoo correctly -- and I was going to dive into the code and\n&gt; try to see why.  But first I need to be able to build the system.\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe eventually I could switch to the new version, but the older\n&gt; version seems better filled out with conveniences, like a better\n&gt; web-based administration system, probably because the new one is\n&gt; still under construction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for any and all help.\n&gt;\n&gt; -- Steve\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
