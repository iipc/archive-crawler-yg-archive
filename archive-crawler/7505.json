I have a few questions that I was hoping someone could \nanswer.\n\n1) Is there a way to refactor/reconfigure a started crawl to have more \ninstances.  (i.e In the middle of the crawl increase the number of \ninstances from 5 to some larger or smaller number)\n\n2) Would moving the warc.gz files from the job&#39;s warc directory while \nthe crawl is running to another directory cause any problems?  Does \nHeritrix use these files?  What about the files in the log directory - \ncan they be moved?  We want to prevent these directories from having a \nvery large number of files in them where the OS would start to have \nproblems.\n\n3) One big concern for us is invalid checkpoints.  We would like to \nverify that our checkpoints are valid.  Is it possible to copy a subset \nof a job directory to another location to use with another Heritrix job? \n  The idea would be to start a separate instance of Heritrix on separate \nmachine using this copied data and the last checkpoint to verify that \nthe last checkpoint is a valid checkpoint (no plans to actually crawl \nfrom this test instance)? If possible this could also be useful for \ndebugging while still crawling with the original instance.\n\n4) What is the best way to inject additional URIs into a started crawl? \n  We would like to inject a set of specific URIs daily and would like \nfor this set of URIs to be crawled as soon as possible (if they have not \nalready been crawled).\n\n5) Although I can capture the below statistics manually, can you suggest \na way that I can automatically generate/collect the following statistics \nfrom the crawl. I would like to generate this data at least once every \n24 hours and possibly as often as every hour.\n\na) Total size of crawled data.\nb) total number of pages crawled (mime-type:  text/html).\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid\n\n\n\n\n"}}
