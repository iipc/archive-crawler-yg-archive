I have noticed that your wacbot sends the following user\nagent string:\n\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; wacbot +http://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/wacbot)\n\nAre you aware that this infringes on the Mozilla people&#39;s trademark?\nIt&#39;s also a generally bad thing for the internet to go around\npretending you&#39;re someone else.\nThe user agent string you should be sending would preferably look\nsomething like this:\n\nwacbot/1.0 (+http://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/wacbot)\n\nI&#39;m not affiliated with Mozilla, but would just like to ask nicely\nthat you change it.\nI understand that some sites treat browsers differently if they have\nthe word &quot;Mozilla&quot; or &quot;compatible&quot; in the UA, but honestly those\nsites aren&#39;t worth spidering anyway, and their numbers are so few\nthat a purpose such as yours (linguistics) would be almost unaffected.\n\n\n-- \nMarco Baroni\nSSLMIT, University of Bologna\nhttp://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni\n\n"}}
