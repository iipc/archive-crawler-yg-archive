I know that we have some investment in the format, and though\n&gt; &gt; we can of course move forward it is not clear to me from looking at\n&gt; &gt; the sheets.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were a number of reasons:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. The XML wasn&#39;t well-defined for most modules, so the benefits of  \n&gt; XML were mostly lost. Eg, it would be nice to have\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;FetchDNS&gt;\n&gt; &lt;accept-non-dns-resolves&gt;false&lt;/accept-non-dns-resolves&gt;\n&gt; &lt;deciderules/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;digest-algorithm&gt;SHA1&lt;/digest-algorithm&gt;\n&gt; &lt;digest-content&gt;true&lt;/digest-content&gt;\n&gt; &lt;enabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/FetchDNS&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; ...so that configuration sheets could be validated using standard XML  \n&gt; tools. But that would also be a huge departure from the existing  \n&gt; order.xml, would require more infrastructure, and would make it more  \n&gt; difficult to support third-party modules.\n\nWill it be possible to validate the new structure at all?\n\n&gt; 2. XML&#39;s nesting provides a good visual sense of structure for the  \n&gt; old order.xml and for the new global sheet, but didn&#39;t work so well  \n&gt; for override sheets, which typically contain only a few settings.  \n&gt; We&#39;d either have to nest many levels of empty tags to get to the  \n&gt; actual overrides, or have two different XML formats for the global  \n&gt; sheet and override sheets.\n\nI think the sense of structure is a fairly important baby to be throwing\nout with the bathwater.  We&#39;re actually in NetarchiveSuite moving\ntowards something that&#39;s uses the XML structure more rather than seeing\nit as key-value pairs.  \n\n&gt; 3. The one-setting-per-line format plays well with command-line tools  \n&gt; such as diff.\n\nThat&#39;s probably my biggest gripe against XML in general.  There is\nxgrep, but it&#39;s not nearly at the level of grep in usability.\n\n&gt; 4. The one-setting-per-line format closely resembles the new JMX API  \n&gt; for modifying sheets. In particular, code used for JMX transport of  \n&gt; settings is re-used to read/write the sheet files.\n\nIt&#39;s obviously bad to have a different format for modifying sheets, but\ncouldn&#39;t the JMX API use XML instead, passing arbitrary parts of a sheet\nXML?\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In most cases the values for these new module settings are deduced\n&gt; &gt;&gt; automatically by the settings framework, so hopefully you won&#39;t have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to worry about them. They are all listed in the Web UI and module\n&gt; &gt;&gt; documentation though.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does this mean that there are sensible default values?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes; they default to use the primary. See below.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I’m a little bit confused, still. I’m looking at the global.sheet for\n&gt; &gt; profile-broad_but_shallow. Some of the items hold values:\n&gt; &gt; ‘root:scope:rules:1:max-hops=int, 2’, and some don’t:\n&gt; &gt; ‘root:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers=list,\n&gt; &gt; java.lang.String’. Is this second one an empty string? If so, how are\n&gt; &gt; lists defined?\n&gt; \n&gt; The second one is not an empty string; it&#39;s saying &quot;Create a new list  \n&gt; that will only contain String values.&quot;\n\nI get nervous twitches every time I see something evolve from fairly\nsimple to having its own type system (having done that too many times\nmyself:).  It&#39;s a sign that it&#39;s getting too complex.  I will admit,\nthough, that I never quite liked the way the old order.xml files looked,\nwhere the XML tags for most things were the types rather than the\nmeaning.  I&#39;d find it more readable if the type definitions were outside\nthe structure, e.g. in a RelaxNG or DSD spec, or at most added as an\nattribute.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is the difference between ‘primary, org.archive[...]’ and\n&gt; &gt; ‘object, org.archive[...]’?\n&gt; \n&gt; Each class of object can have one &quot;primary&quot; object nominated in the  \n&gt; global sheet. If  a setting uses the &quot;primary&quot; tag then the object  \n&gt; created is registered as the primary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Primary objects are automatically selected as the default value for  \n&gt; most module settings. For instance, FetchHTTP has a server-cache  \n&gt; setting for specifying the ServerCache to use with FetchHTTP. The  \n&gt; default value for that setting is to use the &quot;primary&quot; ServerCache.  \n&gt; In this way only one ServerCache instance needs to be specified in  \n&gt; the sheet, and all the modules that need it just find it.\n\nI like that.  I&#39;ll have to remember it for our purposes.\n\nWe&#39;ve talked occasionally about using Spring for settings.  I don&#39;t know\nyet if Spring is the best, but wouldn&#39;t it be more reasonable to follow\nsome kind of standard for settings files rather than re-inventing the\nwheel (much as that is a favorite passtime of programmers:)?\n\n-Lars\n\n\n"}}
