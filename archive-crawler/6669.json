This would give some information abou=\r\nt the effectiveness of the regex.\n\nOf course we&#39;d need to ensure that the p=\r\nerformance of the &#39;standard&#39; modules is not degraded, but if the general fa=\r\ncility was in place it would be easy to add custom DecideRules if you have =\r\nmore extensive needs. Some of the reporting could also be optionally enable=\r\nd.\n\nAny thoughts and comments on this idea would be welcome. If positive I&#39;=\r\nll assemble a more detailed RFE.\n\n- Kris\n\n\n"}}
