So,\n&gt; I did some research into the Server vs. Client VM per the\n&gt; suggestion.  Turns out 1.5 will automatically use the server VM if\n&gt; the machine has more than 2 GB of RAM or 2 CPU&#39;s. \n\nInteresting to know.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, I tried launching HEAD with the &#39;-client&#39; option to force\n&gt; the client VM, but the heritrix_out.log file kep saying I was using\n&gt; the server VM.  However, a kill -3 command to the java process shows\n&gt; the client VM in the log file.  So, after looking in the start\n&gt; script, I see that you&#39;re just running a -version.  This will ALWAYS\n&gt; show the server VM on a machine with the above configs. Maybe run\n&gt; the -version command along with JAVA_OPTS?\n&gt;\nI did as you suggested.\n\n&gt; Also, FYI, the new 64-bit JVM for AMD64 will not run in client\n&gt; mode.  I was hoping to use the new VM on my hardware to give\n&gt; heritrix a bit more RAM in the heap, but heritrix doesn&#39;t seem to\n&gt; play well with the server JVM.  I&#39;ve tried this with the x86 JVM and\n&gt; the 64-bit JVM with variuos heap sizes..\n&gt;\nSo, you&#39;re finding that when the &#39;-server&#39; flag is present, Heritrix \ndoes a SIGSEGV?\n\nThanks,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Greg\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
