The format is now:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OPERATOR SPECIFIED&gt; &#39;-&#39; &lt;12 DIGIT TIMESTAMP&gt; &#39;-&#39; &lt;SERIAL NO.&gt; &#39;-&#39; &lt;FQDN \n&gt; HOSTNAME&gt; &#39;.arc&#39; | &#39;.gz&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; ... where &lt;OPERATOR SPECIFIED&gt; is any operator specified text, &lt;SERIAL \n&gt; NO&gt; is a zero-padded 5 digit number and &lt;FQDN HOSTNAME&gt; is the \n&gt; fully-qualified domainname on which the crawl was run.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is an example: UKGOV-200403221010-00004-debord.archive.org.arc.gz\n&gt; \n&gt; The rest of this note is a more formal description of the HEADER section \n&gt; of Gordon&#39;s note describing the changes we intend to make to the ARC \n&gt; record metadata header and metadata body.  Again, comments are invited.\n&gt; \n&gt; ARC FILE METADATA RECORD -- i.e. the first record of an ARC -- PROPOSED \n&gt; CHANGES\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. If an ARC file metadata record has extra information in its body, the \n&gt; second &#39;&lt;reserved&gt;&#39; field of the second line of version 1 ARC files will \n&gt; be changed from &#39;0&#39; to &#39;1&#39;.  Previously, in version 1, ARC metadata \n&gt; records had zero-length bodies [See #1 for description of version 1 ARC \n&gt; files].\n&gt; 2. If present, the ARC file metadata record body will contain at least \n&gt; the following fields.  Later revisions of may add other fields:\n&gt; \n&gt; 2a.  Software and software version used creating the ARC file.  The \n&gt; value of this field is not overrideable by an operator.  Example: \n&gt; &#39;heritrix 0.7.1 http://crawler.archive.org&#39;.\n&gt; 2b. The IP of the host that created the ARC file.  The value of this \n&gt; field is not overrideable by an operator.  Example: &#39;103.1.0.3&#39;.\n&gt; 2c. The hostname of the host that created the ARC file.  The value of \n&gt; this field is not overrideable by an operator.  Example \n&gt; &#39;debord.archive.org&#39;.\n&gt; 2d. Contact name of the crawl operator.   The operator will be able to \n&gt; set this value upon job creation.  Default value is &#39;admin&#39;. 2e. The \n&gt; http-header &#39;user-agent&#39; field from the crawl-job order file. This field \n&gt; is recorded here in the metadata only until the day ARCs record the HTTP \n&gt; request made.  Example: &#39;os-heritrix/0.7.0 (+http://localhost.localdomain)&#39;.\n&gt; 2f. The http-header &#39;from&#39; from the crawl-job order file.  This field is \n&gt; recorded here in the metadata only until the day ARCs record the HTTP \n&gt; request made.  Example: &#39;webmaster@...&#39;.\n&gt; 2g. The &#39;description&#39; from the crawl-job order file.  Example: &#39;Heritrix \n&gt; integrated selftest&#39;.\n&gt; 2h. Robots obeyed.  Copied from crawl-job order file.  Example: &#39;true&#39;.\n&gt; 2i. Organization on whose behalf the operator is running the crawl.  \n&gt; Example &#39;Internet Archive&#39;.\n&gt; 2j. The &#39;name&#39; from the crawl-job order file.  Example: &#39;Selftest&#39; or \n&gt; &#39;UKGOV-April2004&#39;.\n&gt; 2k. The recipient of the crawl ARC resource if known.  Example: &#39;Library \n&gt; of Congress&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. The above listed fields will be written into the ARC file metadata \n&gt; body as validatable XML.\n&gt; 4. The XML Schema used to validate will be in the main qualified Dublin \n&gt; Core [#2] with mixed in Internet Archive elements and refinements.  The \n&gt; DC elements with qualifiers will be used to describe the ARC resource \n&gt; itself.  The Internet Archive elements will be used to record \n&gt; information about the context in which the crawler wrote the ARC and \n&gt; Internet Archive element-qualifiers will be used refining DC elements.\n&gt; 5.  Here are example XML instances to match the XML schema as yet \n&gt; undefined outlined in 4. above featuring the fields listed in 2. above.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5.1 Selftest\n&gt; \n&gt; Given:\n&gt; \n&gt; Operator=&quot;stack at archive dot org&quot;\n&gt; Organization=&quot;Internet Archive&quot;\n&gt; Crawl-Job Description=&quot;Heritrix integrated selftest.&quot;\n&gt; Crawl-Job Name=&quot;Selftest&quot;\n&gt; Recipient of arc=&quot;Selftest analysis&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The XML instance will look like:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;arcmetadata xmlns=&quot;http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0/&quot;\n&gt;  xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\n&gt;  xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0 \n&gt; http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0/schema.xsd&quot;\n&gt;  &lt;!--iac namespace done for sake of clarity demarking naming in the \n&gt; below.--&gt;\n&gt;  xmlns:iac=&quot;http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0/&quot;\n&gt;  xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;\n&gt;  xmlns:dcterms=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&quot;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;dc:publisher&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/dc:publisher&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:description&gt;Heritrix integrated selftest&lt;/dc:description&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dcterms:audience&gt;Selftest analysis&lt;/dcterms:audience&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dcterms:isPartOf xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:Collection&quot;&gt;Selftest&lt;/dcterms:isPartOf&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:operator&quot;&gt;stack at archive org&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:host-ip&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:hostname&quot;&gt;localhost.localdomain&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:software&quot;&gt;Heritrix 0.7.1 \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;iac:robots-honored&gt;true&lt;/iac:robots-honored&gt;\n&gt; &lt;iac:http-header-from&gt;stack@...&lt;/iac:iac:http-header-from&gt;\n&gt; &lt;iac:http-header-user-agent&gt;os-heritrix/0.7.0 \n&gt; (+http://localhost.localdomain)\n&gt;     &lt;/iac:http-header-user-agent&gt;\n&gt; &lt;!--Boilerplate--&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:type&gt;ARC file version 1.1&lt;/dc:type&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dcterms:conformsTo\n&gt; xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:URI&quot;&gt;http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php&lt;/dcterms:conformsTo&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/arcmetadata&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; 5.2 Library of Congress crawl run by Internet Archive\n&gt; \n&gt; Given:\n&gt; \n&gt; Operator=&quot;stack at archive dot org&quot;\n&gt; Organization=&quot;Internet Archive&quot;\n&gt; Crawl-Job Description=&quot;May 2004 Election Crawl.&quot;\n&gt; Crawl-Job Name=&quot;Election2004-May&quot;\n&gt; Recipient of arc=&quot;Library of Congress&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The XML instance will look like:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;arcmetadata xmlns=&quot;http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0/&quot;\n&gt;  xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\n&gt;  xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0 \n&gt; http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0/schema.xsd&quot;\n&gt;  &lt;!--iac namespace done for sake of clarity demarking naming in the \n&gt; below.--&gt;\n&gt;  xmlns:iac=&quot;http://archive.org/arc/meta/1.0/&quot;\n&gt;  xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;\n&gt;  xmlns:dcterms=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&quot;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;dc:publisher&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/dc:publisher&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:description&gt;May 2004 Election Crawl&lt;/dc:description&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dcterms:audience&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/dcterms:audience&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dcterms:isPartOf \n&gt; xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:Collection&quot;&gt;Election2004-May&lt;/dcterms:isPartOf&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:operator&quot;&gt;stack at archive org&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:host-ip&quot;&gt;123.1.2.3&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:hostname&quot;&gt;crawl08.archive.org&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;iac:software&quot;&gt;Heritrix 0.7.1 \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org&lt;/dc:creator&gt;\n&gt; &lt;iac:robots-honored&gt;false&lt;/iac:robots-honored&gt;\n&gt; &lt;iac:http-header-from&gt;stack@...&lt;/iac:iac:http-header-from&gt;\n&gt; &lt;iac:http-header-user-agent&gt;os-heritrix/0.7.0 \n&gt; (+http://localhost.localdomain)\n&gt;     &lt;/iac:http-header-user-agent&gt;\n&gt; &lt;!--Boilerplate--&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dc:type&gt;ARC file version 1.1&lt;/dc:type&gt;\n&gt; &lt;dcterms:conformsTo\n&gt; xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:URI&quot;&gt;http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php&lt;/dcterms:conformsTo&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/arcmetadata&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; 6.

Some of these are good ideas\n&gt;  &gt; that we won&#39;t get to for 1.0, but will keep on the docket for\n&gt;  &gt; later.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; kaisa_kaunonen wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Hi all,\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; good ideas you have, here are a couple of comments =&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; It&#39;s not possible to tell from file names which job each arc file\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; comes from?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Not automatically: it depends on the operator choosing an ARC name\n&gt;  &gt; prefix that correlates with the Heritrix job name.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I don&#39;t think we want to force these to be the same. The job\n&gt;  &gt; names get a formulaic (timestamp) expansion for UI convenience\n&gt;  &gt; and uniqueness within the application&#39;s domain. However, the\n&gt;  &gt; naming needs for long-term ARC file archival may be different and\n&gt;  &gt; thus can be chosen in separate ARC name options.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Job names should definitely go into the in-ARC header record;\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ll make that a clear part of the arc-header spec.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; During harvesting every job has its own directory but in the end one\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; may place all arcs into a bigger pool for further processing.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Would a series number be unique only inside a job so you could have\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; files\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; name - 00001 - timestamp1 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; name - 00001 - timestamp2 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; name - 00001-  timestamp3 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; name - 00001 - timestamp4 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; produced by four different jobs. I somehow think a running series\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; number in an archive implies that no two files in an archive have\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; identical s-numbers (even if their timestamps differ)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The serial numbers are strictly within a single crawl/job for now.\n&gt;  &gt; Attempting uniqueness over a larger domain would require other\n&gt;  &gt; coordination between jobs, software runs, software installs, etc.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It is currently up to the operator to vary the prefix-names on\n&gt;  &gt; subsequent runs in such a situation. If they don&#39;t, the above\n&gt;  &gt; is possible, which is a potential source of confusion with both\n&gt;  &gt; the grouping you show, and when you consider that the default\n&gt;  &gt; sort order of the ARCs of separate crawls will be...\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00001 - timestamp1 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00001 - timestamp3 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00001-  timestamp5 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00001 - timestamp7 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00002 - timestamp2 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00002 - timestamp4 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00002-  timestamp6 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; name - 00002 - timestamp8 - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Because of this, we&#39;ve decided to keep the timestamp and serial-number\n&gt;  &gt; values in the current code&#39;s order, timestamp first, then serial-number,\n&gt;  &gt; so that within a given &#39;name&#39;, the lexicographic sort order will always\n&gt;  &gt; match the time-sort order.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; S-number makes file names more unique but it&#39;s not very informative.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; We find the serial numbers helpful as a way to highlight a\n&gt;  &gt; particular ARC as the container of a resource of interest.\n&gt;  &gt; For example, &quot;you can grep for the weird server response in ARC\n&gt;  &gt; #27&quot;. The timestamps are somewhat more difficult to use as\n&gt;  &gt; casual pointers.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Would it be possible to use job name instead\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; OperatorGivenName - Jobname - Timestamp - IP.arc.gz for example =&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; finland - photoarchives - timestamp - IP.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Slight problem of course that job names have variable lengths unlike\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; s-numbers.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I suspect many operators will want to make their ARC prefixes\n&gt;  &gt; and jobnames match, but for the reasons listed above, I&#39;d\n&gt;  &gt; rather not enforce that relationship in software.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Some other ideas for the future:\n&gt;  &gt;   - an operator could be offered a easy way (checkbox?) to\n&gt;  &gt;     make the ARC prefix conform to the job name\n&gt;  &gt;   - an operator could be warned if a arc-prefix was used\n&gt;  &gt;     in a known previous crawl, and offered a suggested\n&gt;  &gt;     revision\n&gt;  &gt;   - the crawler could consult an external inventory process\n&gt;  &gt;     somewhere to verify that a proposed crawl name and\n&gt;  &gt;     ARC prefix are unique\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Andrew Boyko wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; # The ARC naming proposal sounds good to me.  The only thing I might\n&gt;  &gt; # ponder is the idea of a separate identifier, for the instance of a\n&gt;  &gt; # repeated crawl.   Obviously the operator could just add a suffix to the\n&gt;  &gt; # &#39;operator-given-name&#39;, and the timestamp is a clear key to regularly\n&gt;  &gt; # repeated crawls (monthly or weekly), so this isn&#39;t a big deal.  \n&gt; Even so,\n&gt;  &gt; # it&#39;s still compelling to have the tool auto-generate a sequence number\n&gt;  &gt; # whenever a operator-given-name is reused within an instance of the \n&gt; tool.\n&gt;  &gt; #  Two or three digits would presumably more than cover it.\n&gt;  &gt; #\n&gt;  &gt; # So in the example of repeated Congress crawls (to choose an example at\n&gt;  &gt; # random :), assuming the same instance of the tool is used for each, the\n&gt;  &gt; # seventh ARC for the fifth instance of the crawl would be\n&gt;  &gt; #    CONGRESS005-00007-20040420133907-FG71E2B.arc.gz\n&gt;  &gt; # where the 005 is automatically assigned by the crawler based on the\n&gt;  &gt; # prior instances it knows of, and of course defaults to 001 for any new\n&gt;  &gt; # crawl name.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; We&#39;ve been relying on operator diligence to do this, and picking \n&gt; date-related\n&gt;  &gt; names -- things like CONGRESS0312 (dec 2003), CONGRESS0401 (jan \n&gt; 2004), etc.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I agree automating this would be a big operator convenience For the \n&gt; current\n&gt;  &gt; update, though, we&#39;ll leave this as a manual practice rather than rush in\n&gt;  &gt; an automated system that might be constraining.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; # As far as the new header block, why not add the entire crawl order and\n&gt;  &gt; # seed list?  A couple K added to a 100MB file shouldn&#39;t worry anyone.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Excellent point. It might also be achieved as a special record\n&gt;  &gt; past the header; perhaps even as a crawler self-fetch, like...\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;    http://127.0.0.1:8080/currentcrawl/order.xml\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It might be sufficient to do this only for the first ARC, or otherwise\n&gt;  &gt; include this info by reference where preferred by the operator.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
