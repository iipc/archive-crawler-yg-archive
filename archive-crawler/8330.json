In the beginning of\n&gt; a crawl the disc&#39;s usage is low but it consumes a lot after some days.\n&gt;\n&gt; I noticed that the .jbd files increase really fast. For exemple:\n&gt;\n&gt;     # of .jdb |  Aug days\n&gt;     1171 16\n&gt;      260 17\n&gt;      607 18\n&gt;     1007 19\n&gt;     2222 20\n&gt;     4411 21\n&gt;     5422 22\n&gt;     7877 23\n&gt;     7689 24\n&gt;     6763 25\n&gt;     9779 26\n&gt;    11002 27\n&gt;    12100 28\n&gt;    12796 29\n&gt;    19314 30\n&gt;    23914 31\n&gt;\n&gt;    # of .jdb |  Sep days\n&gt;    37195 2\n&gt;    43946 3\n&gt;    42417 4\n&gt;    42774 5\n&gt;\n&gt; I understood reading the forum and documentation (if not, correct me)\n&gt; that these files is part of the crawler&#39;s state and they keep olds uri\n&gt; to avoid repetition crawling. So, I just can&#39;t remove them but is there\n&gt; anything that could be done to avoid saving to much information for the\n&gt; deduplicator?\n\nIn the default setup, the JDB files (which support the Berkeley-DB-Java \nEdition database used by Heritrix) mainly track (1) the URIs \nalready-seen; and (2) the ordered queues of URIs waiting to be fetched. \n(There are a few other things that are relatively quite small.)\n\nIf you change the crawler to sue something other the BdbUriUniqFilter, \nthose files won&#39;t store (1). If you add other modules, they might also \nstore other things among the JDB files.\n\nIn general all the data there is needed while the crawl is running (or \nif you want it to be resumable, or the source of URI data to be carried \nforward to a future re-crawl).\n\nNote, though, that checkpoints keep extra JDB files around (via \nhard-links)... so if you&#39;re using checkpoints, and move past the time \nthat you think you&#39;d need to resume from a particular checkpoint, you \ncould delete that checkpoint&#39;s directories (and thus discard unneeded \nJDB files).\n\nI don&#39;t know what duplication-reduction options you may have enabled \nthat could also be bloating things.\n\nMost likely it&#39;s the growing size of your pending-URI queues that&#39;s the \nmajor contributor; if you can tighten your scope to ensure unwanted (or \nunlikely-to-ever-be-crawled) URIs are never enqueued, that&#39;d help limit \nthe on-disk growth.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
