Frontier operations -- testing URIs for prior inclusion, and \nenqueuing new URIs -- will become slower as they require seeks/reads \nover ever-larger disk structures.\n\n(Some of the summary reports designed for smaller crawls -- notably the \n&#39;seeds report&#39;, maybe others -- may try to use an unbounded amount of \nRAM when triggered in Heritrix 1.x and 2.x. The workaround is not to \ntrigger them -- but also all known issues of this type have been fixed \nas of the latest prerelease Heritrix 3-beta builds.)\n\nFor crawls where a single machine is expected to visit &gt; 100 million \nURIs, to avoid the slowdown as the crawl grows, we usually swap the \ndisk-based already-included class (BdbUriUniqFilter) for an in-memory\nimplementation (BloomUriUniqFilter) that doesn&#39;t slow over time, but \ninstead has a small false-positive rate (that then grows if the filter \nbecomes oversaturated). (The defaults, which are adjustable if you have \nmore RAM, use 512MB to acheive a 1-in-4-million false-positive rate up \nthrough 125 million discovered URIs.)\n\nIA has done crawls up to 2 billion URIs with Heritrix using multiple \nmachines, and we know of outside teams who have done crawls of over 8 \nbillion URIs using the same general techniques, which can be scaled \nfurther with more machines.\n\nSeparate but related: we&#39;ve long been interested in having a \nalready-included structure matching that described in the Mercator \npapers (or as updated in the recent IRLbot paper), which would offer a \ndisk-based structure that wouldn&#39;t slow as much with growth as our \ncurrent implementation. Our active crawls haven&#39;t yet reached the scale \nwhere such an implementation is urgent. (The manner in which candidate \nURIs are passed through a duplicate filter, allowing for batching and \nwithout the assumption of instant enqueuing, was designed to allow these \ntechniques to be dropped-in when needed.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; farbgeist\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
