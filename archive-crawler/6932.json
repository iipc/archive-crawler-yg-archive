The crawler typically does not visit the same \nURIs twice, so there&#39;s no expected speedup from caching. Perhaps in your \nspecific local network, the proxy had access to more inbound bandwidth \nthan the originating machine?\n\nIn general, I wouldn&#39;t expect sending crawler traffic through a proxy \nwould accelerate crawling -- though it is a configuration option on the \nFetchHTTP processor, if you want to try it.\n\nWhy you&#39;re hitting the cap you describe is likely something specific to \nyour machine and network. Also, if you are only crawling one or a small \nnumber of sites, the path to those sites, or those sites&#39; own \nclient-throttling settings, may be the limiting factor.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/20/10 9:11 AM, yotpo.official wrote:\n&gt; In my prior crawlers I gained a significant improvement of my Downloaded KB/Sec when I used a proxy with the crawler. Is that the case with Heritrix 3 also?\n&gt; Even with 1024 RAM, 60 Threads, 50 parallel queuing I can&#39;t reach more than an average of 300-400 KB/Sec. I tried all the improvements in the FAQ but it didn’t helped much, after a while not all the Threads are active and I don&#39;t know why… I thought maybe a proxy would help.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
