Are you &quot;redeploying&quot;=\r\n production kit? Maybe a fresh production \ndeploy would clear the problem.\n=\r\n\nDo you have full stack traces for these exception? I think those would \nhe=\r\nlp diagnose the problem. Do you know what heritrix feature WCT is \ntrying t=\r\no access every 10 minutes via JMX (if any)?\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\nPope, Jackson=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; Hiya all,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m getting some weird behaviour from Herit=\r\nrix 1.8 running under WCT. \n&gt; This all works on our test kit, but trying to=\r\n deploy to our production\n\n&gt; kit we get the following errors, so I doubt it=\r\n&#39;s a WCT error, but it \n&gt; could easily be a config problem. I&#39;m not sure wh=\r\nat I should be \n&gt; checking, the heritrix.home settings look alright, the to=\r\nmcat user\nowns \n&gt; the heritrix.home and crawl base directories, but there a=\r\nre no logs\nand \n&gt; no arcs.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The job is created via JMX and is vi=\r\nsible through jconsole, where it\nis \n&gt; apparently running, however WCT is r=\r\neporting that it&#39;s in the\nPreparing \n&gt; state. In the Catalina.out we&#39;re get=\r\nting a \n&gt; javax.management.InstanceAlreadyExistsException followed fairly\ns=\r\nwiftly \n&gt; by a javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException, followed by an 1=\r\n1 \n&gt; minute wait and then those two errors again.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Has anyone se=\r\nen anything similar, or got any advice for things to\ncheck?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jack\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Jackson Pope\n&gt; \n&gt; Technical Lead\n&gt; \n&gt; Web Arc=\r\nhiving Team\n&gt; \n&gt; The British Library\n&gt; \n&gt; +44 (0)1937 54 6942\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;\n*=\r\n***********************************************************************\n**\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Experience the British Library online at www.bl.uk &lt;http://www.bl.uk/=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; The British Library&#39;s new interactive Annual Report and Accounts\n20=\r\n06/07 \n&gt; : www.bl.uk/mylibrary &lt;http://www.bl.uk/mylibrary&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Help the =\r\nBritish Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
