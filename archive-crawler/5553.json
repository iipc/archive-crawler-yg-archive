I tried using 2.0.1 recently (Was trying to help along the \n&gt; hbase-writer effort: http://code.google.com/p/hbase-writer/).  I had a \n&gt; similar experience.  I had to authenticate every time I submittted a \n&gt; form and then it&#39;d NPE more often than it&#39;d work.  Whats up w/ 2.0.x?  \n&gt; Is it being used by anyone?\n\nI haven&#39;t encountered nor previously heard of any 2.0.1 web UI issue \nwhere reauthentication is necessary on every submit, so I&#39;d have to \nguess this was something unique to your browser/network situation.\n\nIf you can reproduce, more details about the problem would be great.\n\nAt IA we haven&#39;t yet adopted any 2.0.x builds for production crawling, \nand don&#39;t expect to until after 2.2 is available. However, from list \ntraffic it seems some people are having both success and issues actively \nusing 2.0.x releases.\n\n&gt; Was also wondering about the move to Apache-licensing project that was \n&gt; talked of a while back up on the list?\n\nA future release, most likely 2.2, will move to the Apache 2 license. \nThe steps required to get there include:\n  - source file relabelling\n  - replacing or moving to a well-defined subsection that remains LGPL \nsome code that originated in other LGPL projects (eg. MG4J/fastutil)\n  - ensuring any major standalone components/classes from outside \ncontributors have the contributor&#39;s permission to relicense\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
