It does not change the \nform of the URI visited or recorded in any log or written output.\n\nSo, once &quot;http://hello/i/$am/here/&quot; is scheduled, if your \ncanonicalization is properly stripping the &#39;$&#39;, then it will prevent any \nother URIs that canonicalize the same way from being scheduled in the \nfuture. For example, since &quot;http://hello/i/am/here/&quot; and \n&quot;http://hello/i/am/$here/&quot; would both canonicalize the same way, neither \nwould pass already-scheduled testing in the future.\n\nAlso, I don&#39;t believe the {} brackets are needed for backreferences in \nthe replacement-format string.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nmjjjhjemj wrote:\n&gt; I am using the following uri-canonicalization-rules in my crawl:\n&gt; --&gt; RegexRule\n&gt; enabled: true\n&gt; matching-regex: ^(.+)(?:&#92;/&#92;$)(.*)$\n&gt; format: ${1}${2}\n&gt; \n&gt; Where as I know &quot;^(.+)(?:&#92;/&#92;$)(.*)$&quot; is not quite what I want since\n&gt; this should remove the leading &quot;/&quot; for file directories that start\n&gt; with &quot;/$&quot;, but this does not even do as I expected:\n&gt; expected output given http://hello/i/$am/here/...\n&gt; should be http://hello/iam/here/...\n&gt; It is not doing anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; My goal is if heritrix finds:\n&gt; http://hello/i/$am/here/...\n&gt; \n&gt; to change it to:\n&gt; http://hello/i/am/here/...\n&gt; \n&gt; both in the reference in the text of all files captured and the\n&gt; filenames of the files captured.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help would be appreciated,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
