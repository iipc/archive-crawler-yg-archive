It may be worth putting a discussion of this into the docs\nsomewhere.\n\n&gt; You have hold-queues enabled? Then this is what I&#39;d expect (You might \n&gt; change the &#39;balance-replenish-amount&#39; setting so its less than 3000 so \n&gt; other queues get rotated in quicker).\n\nYes, hold-queues is enabled.\n\nIs there a description of the balance-replenish-amount,\nqueue-total-budget, and cost-policy settings outside of the source\ncode?\n\n&gt; Igor asks if the uncrawled seeds are showing in the seeds report -- are \n&gt; they recognized as uncrawled (There&#39;s an issue where we recognize seeds \n&gt; only if they have a scheme OR they look like a host name -- otherwise, \n&gt; they&#39;re skipped).\n\nYes, they are showing up as uncrawled. All the URLs were extracted\nfrom the DMOZ catalog and are in canonical form.\n\n&gt; &gt; The threads report states that there are 92 in the pool, but lists\n&gt; &gt; status for 100. How can I find the 8 that aren&#39;t being used?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; We ain&#39;t sure why it would report any less than 100 threads in the \n&gt; pool.  Anything in heritrix_out.log?  Runtime/local errors? Send us over \n&gt; the report so we can take a look.\n\nIt&#39;s down to &quot;85 of 89&quot; threads now.\n\nTHere have been no alerts.
