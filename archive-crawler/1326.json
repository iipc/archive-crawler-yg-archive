But when i try to run a\n&gt; &gt; crawl job from my app, Heritrix seems to be unable to make DNS\n&gt; &gt; lookups.\n&gt;\n&gt; The same order file is used in standalone Heritrix and works?  Same\n&gt; platform?  Is this a windows box (Perhaps the following is related:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/772)? \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/772%29?&gt;\n&gt;\nThank You for your answer!\n\nYes, i am running Heritrix on a Windows 2000 box. I have moved \nheritrix&#39;s JAR to the top of my classpath, and now, it works.\n\nBut there is still one strange problem: I have to put IP addresses in my \nseeds.txt file. Whenever a DNS lookup is needed, \n*org.archive.util.DNSJavaUtil.*getHostAddress(....) blocks during 30 \nseconds, and returns a null.\n\nI have made a small main() which tests getHostAddress alone, and i have obtained the same results: \nit always blocks for 30 seconds (this looks like a default timeout value) and then returns a Null. \nNo log messages are printed.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
