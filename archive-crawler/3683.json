Its primarily a bug-fix \nrelease with a few small improvements but the main motivation for \nputting out 1.10.2 at this particular time is that we are about to do \nradical surgery on the Heritrix source tree.\n\n1.10.2 will be the last Heritrix version built out of CVS using maven \n1.0.x.  Over the next week or so we will move Heritrix source to \nsubversion and our build system to maven 2.0.  Once complete, Heritrix \nsource will undergo further churn as we merge in the \n&quot;Root_pjack_settings&quot; branch into TRUNK.  Paul Jack has been working on \na new Heritrix settings system, in short, to make Heritrix components \nusable outside of a Heritrix context and more amenable to unit testing.  \nAlmost every processor and most of the UI has been touched by the \nrefactoring (How settings are persisted to disk -- the order.xml -- will \nalso likely change though we expect to provide tools to help migrate \nyour settings investments).  Expect a note from Paul soon with an \noverview.  Meantime, the brave can take a look at the new system out on \nthe branch but be warned that currently only the cognoscenti can make \nthe &quot;Root_pjack_settings&quot; branch actually perform crawls.\n\nWe&#39;re shooting for a March release for the release to follow 1.10.2.\n\nOther changes to expect are a move of our issue tracking and wiki from \nsourceforge to JIRA and Confluence systems hosted here at the Archive \ncourtesy of an Open Source Project/Non-Profit Atlassian license.\n\nAs always, questions or commentary are welcome.\n\nYours,\nThe Internet Archive Webteam\n\n\n\n\n"}}
