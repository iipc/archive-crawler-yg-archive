Heretrix is often running into an=\r\n Out of Memory\n&gt; &gt; error. I dont recall seeing this error with an older ver=\r\nsion of\n&gt; &gt; heretrix v1.8 that I had running for quite sometime.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n am running it on a 64 bit machine. And the version of java I am\n&gt; &gt; using =\r\nis j2se_jdk_sun-1.5.0.07. I have the heap size set to 3Gigs\n&gt; &gt; (-Xmx optio=\r\nn.). Does anyone have any ideas on how to resolve this?\n&gt; &gt; Should I try ru=\r\nnning it with a 64 bit JVM, so I can specify a larger\n&gt; &gt; heap? \n&gt; \n&gt; Were =\r\nyou using the exact same JVM (esp. heap) and Heritrix (esp. \n&gt; Processors a=\r\nnd UriUniqFilter) options in 1.8? How long does it take to \n&gt; OOME?\n&gt; \n&gt; A =\r\nproblematic issue with our DNS library using an ever-growing\namount of \n&gt; c=\r\nache memory was resolved between 1.8 and 1.10.2, so I would have \n&gt; expecte=\r\nd fewer OOMEs in long-running crawls, rather than more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some thoughts:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Since you have 8GB, a 64bit JVM and larger heap could help --\nbut=\r\n it \n&gt; tends not help as much as you think, because 64bit object pointers m=\r\nean \n&gt; it takes a large heap to hold the same number of objects. (One estim=\r\nate \n&gt; I&#39;ve seen not specific to Heritrix&#39;s heap: 40% larger heap needed fo=\r\nr \n&gt; same number of 64bit JVM objects.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Not all OOMEs are really c=\r\naused by main heap depletion -- some\nother \n&gt; resource/memory-space depleti=\r\nons also cause OOMEs. Some of these other \n&gt; depletions can be *worsened* b=\r\ny growing a heap closer to an addressing \n&gt; ceiling. If you have a OOME tha=\r\nt&#39;s easy to reproduce quickly, you may \n&gt; want to try running under a 1.6 J=\r\nVM -- its OOME errors are more \n&gt; descriptive, and there are other options =\r\nfor examining the heap (see \n&gt;\nhttp://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/troubl=\r\ne/TSG-VM/html/memleaks.html#gbywi)\n\n&gt; after the OOME.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
