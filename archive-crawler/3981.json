Can anyone tell me if Heritrix uses the uri-list from the\n&gt;&gt; previous crawl as the basis of URIs to perform the conditional GET\n&gt;&gt; with instead of crawling the seed URI and extracting URIs. I assume\n&gt;&gt; this is the case but wanted to verify.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to renew this question: Is there already any documentation, \n&gt; how-to or any other hint concerning the use of the new deduplication \n&gt; feature? Thanks.\n\nSorry for not answering sooner: the only current documentation is the \n1.12.0 &#39;feature notes&#39; at:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Feature+Notes+-+1.12.0\n\nAs a wiki page, this will expand as questions come up about areas \nneeding further clarification. Eventually, it will become a section of \nthe User Manual.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; If ARC files do not contain the duplicate content how will tools like\n&gt;&gt;&gt; WERA and the Java WayBack machine present the Web site?\n&gt;&gt; This question still stands...\n&gt; \n&gt; The WayBack machine will look into the existing content and will take that \n&gt; one instead which is the nearest in date to the content beeing asked for. \n&gt; This is commonly used yet: If you require a HTML page and an embedded \n&gt; image file of that page has not been collected on the corresponding crawl \n&gt; but is available from a previous crawl, the WayBack machine will deliver \n&gt; silently the old image file to embed it into the current page.\n\nExactly right.\n\nAdditionally, the WARC format (still undergoing revision) includes \nrecords/notations for indicating that an URL was considered or visited \nat a certain date and deemed unchanged. A future version of the Wayback \nMachine could, in timeline/list views, indicate such &#39;reconfirmation&#39; \ndates, even while it returns the earliest unchanged version for browsing.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
