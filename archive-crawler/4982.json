When this option is set to\n&gt;  true all URIs are tagged with the seed that originated the path of\n&gt;  discovery. See the 11th column of the crawl.log.\n&gt;\n&gt;  As Mike and Erik pointed out, the current approach would be to deal with\n&gt;  this in the post crawl. If you want Heritrix to aggregate URIs, then you\n&gt;  will have to write a new writer.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Hope this helps.\n&gt;  i.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  mikej wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; There is a hoppath.pl script provided with Heritrix (at least 1.10) in\n&gt;  &gt; the bin dir. I have not used this but I believe it is supposed to do\n&gt;  &gt; exactly what you are looking to do - track a url all the way back to the\n&gt;  &gt; seed. I made a few modifications as the version provided would not\n&gt;  &gt; escape out characters that caused trouble in the pattern matching. I\n&gt;  &gt; have attached the my version. I have not completely tested it, but I\n&gt;  &gt; believe it is working properly.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Mike\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; On Jan 30, 2008 12:30 PM, Erik Hetzner &lt;erik.hetzner@...\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;mailto:erik.hetzner@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; At Wed, 30 Jan 2008 08:37:52 -0800,\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;Travis Jensen&quot; &lt;travis.jensen@...\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &lt;mailto:travis.jensen@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I originally asked this question regarding 2.0RC1, but I didn&#39;t get\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; any response. Given the sparse docs for 2.0, I&#39;m backing up to 1.4.1\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; and asking the same question:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; 1.4.1? There are newer releases in the 1.x branch.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve got a set of seed URLs. Each of the URL has some other\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; meta-data (categorical) associated with it. What I want to do is\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; store each of the crawled URLs along with the meta-data associated\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; with the seed URL.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; So the essence is that you want to track the discovery path of a URL\n&gt;  &gt; back to a seed, and associate arbitrary metadata with a crawl or with\n&gt;  &gt; every URL that was discovered by a certain seed?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Tracking discovery path back to a seed might be possible but I do not\n&gt;  &gt; think that it is currently implemented. Since Heritrix tracks the\n&gt;  &gt; discovery path from a seed to a URL I think it might not be that\n&gt;  &gt; difficult to track the seed itself.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; As for storing metadata, Heritrix does not (as far as I know) concern\n&gt;  &gt; itself with any descriptive metadata about a crawl. This would either\n&gt;  &gt; need to be dealt with outside of Heritrix or added to Heritrix.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Is it possible to keep that meta-data with the seed URL as the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; crawling progresses? Can I do it as a single job with many seeds or\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; do I have to plan on creating a single job per &quot;meta-data&quot;? Where do\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; I plug in to receive the content of the crawled page?\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Any pointers are greatly appreciated.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; What we do here at CDL is have one job per site, where sites have\n&gt;  &gt; descriptive metadata (outside of Heritrix) associated with them. This\n&gt;  &gt; is probably the easiest solution if you don&#39;t want to modify Heritrix.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; best,\n&gt;  &gt; Erik Hetzner\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; ;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n&gt;  &gt; ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n-- \n&quot;Conscious decisions by conscious minds are what make reality real&quot;\n\n"}}
