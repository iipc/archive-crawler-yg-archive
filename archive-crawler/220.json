Code in the crawler will reject\n    these values -- insisting on an actual HTTP URL and recognizable\n    email address -- so these values will have to be changed by any\n    user before crawling, to their own project URL and contact address.\n\n  - Between releases, the User-Agent would be changed to:\n\n      User-Agent: os-heritrix/#.#.#cvs (+PROJECT_URL)\n\n    ...so as to emphasize the CVS origin of the code. (The #.#.#\n    version could also be distinct, as per the even-odd numbering\n    scheme.)\n\n    Still, anyone working from CVS would need to make local changes\n    to these settings before crawling.\n\n  - When doing our own test crawls, we&#39;ll use the Heritrix project\n    website as the PROJECT_URL and the agent problem email address\n    (archive-crawler-agent@...) as the &#39;From&#39;.\n\n    When doing actual collection-for-the-permanent-archive crawls,\n    we would also change the software identifier to read &quot;ia_heritrix&quot;.\n\n    We&#39;ll have to exert due care (or create automation) to ensure the\n    CVS and release configrations are always generic, and our local\n    settings remain local.\n\nSound sensible?\n\n- Gordon\n\nGordon Mohr wrote (in August):\n&gt; FYI, I&#39;ve added code which imposes a stricter requirement on\n&gt; the form of the crawl-order specified &quot;User-Agent&quot; and &quot;From&quot;\n&gt; HTTP-headers.\n&gt; \n&gt; The &quot;User-Agent&quot; must be of the form...\n&gt; \n&gt;   [name] (+[url])[optional-etc]\n&gt; \n&gt; ...and the &quot;From&quot; must be a plausible email address. \n&gt; \n&gt; So if your existing crawl-order configurations fail, this is why.\n&gt; \n&gt; For our current test crawls, let&#39;s use the values...\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;http-headers&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;User-Agent&gt;heritrix-aoc/alpha (+http://crawler.archive.org)&lt;/User-Agent&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;From&gt;archive-crawler-agent@...&lt;/From&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/http-headers&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
