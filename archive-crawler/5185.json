(EG,\n&gt; if you have a &#39;max-delay-ms&#39; of 10000ms, then encounter a Crawl-Delay of\n&gt; 20 seconds, the 20 seconds wins out.)\n&gt;\n&gt; The feature has received cursory testing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The first build in which it appears is #245 from the CruiseControl auto\n&gt; builds:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://builds.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/buildresults/HEAD-heritrix \n&gt; &lt;http://builds.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/buildresults/HEAD-heritrix&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Support for &#39;Allow&#39; and &#39;Crawl-Delay&#39; will be ported to the heritrix2\n&gt; codebase shortly.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt; Gordon Mohr wrote:\n&gt; &gt; joehung302 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m bringing up this issue again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; First of all, we&#39;re now doing repeatable 5B+ crawling using Heritrix.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks to you guys.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; These days we&#39;ve got quite a few complaints about Heritrix not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; honoring the &quot;crawl-delay&quot; parameter. Is this still a planned feature?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Or, how can we help to make it happen? ;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As this only requires shuttling an externally-provided number into the\n&gt; &gt; existing min-delay-ms setting, it should be pretty simple, but was\n&gt; &gt; overlooked as we prioritized issues for 1.14. I&#39;ll take a look soon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll also use this as a chance to remind people that they can vote for\n&gt; &gt; bugs they&#39;d like fixed via the JIRA issue tracker for Heritrix:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:popularissues-panel \n&gt; &lt;http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:popularissues-panel&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Part of issue triage leading up to any release is reviewing the popular\n&gt; &gt; issues, in case there are things we haven&#39;t prioritized internally that\n&gt; &gt; are still important to the wider community.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
