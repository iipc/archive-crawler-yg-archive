As I read at &quot;Mohr-et-al-2004&#39;, the way to decide w=\r\nhat to do with a URI is at Prefetch, more exactly in Preselector. But I don=\r\n&#39;t have a clue what filter or rule can help me. Any suggestions?\n\nAtt.\nElve=\r\nrton.\n\n=3D&gt; The original message:\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n Hello Gordon,\n\n My name is Elverton. I&#39;m doing a re=\r\nsearch in a metric to estimate the numbers of URL of a domain. I have a pro=\r\nblem to solve and you think you can help me.\n\n I want to make a complete gr=\r\naph of all URL&#39;s collected but all I have from crawl.log is the &quot;father&quot; of=\r\n the URL and the URL. This would be necessary but I have an misundertanding=\r\n about one thing: If heritrix collect one URL, suppose &quot;yahoo.com&quot; from &quot;go=\r\nogle.com&quot;. If the heritrix enter in &quot;amazon.com&quot; and found &quot;yahoo.com&quot; agai=\r\nn, in crawl.log will appear:\n\n - - - yahoo.com - google.com\n - - - yahoo.co=\r\nm - amazon.com\n\n or only:\n\n - - - yahoo.com - google.com\n\n So, the heritrix=\r\n will ignore the found in &quot;amazon.com&quot; because it was already found in &quot;goo=\r\ngle.com&quot;?\n\n Att.\n Elverton.\n\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n\n=3D&gt; Gordon&#39;s answer:\n\n---------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n\nYou&#39;re correct, the crawl.log is not enough=\r\n info to make a full web\ngraph... it only records the exact paths that led =\r\nto a URI being first\ndiscovered. You&#39;d need to log more from the crawler be=\r\nfore it &#39;uniques&#39;\nthe URIs for crawling purposes, or perform a post-crawl a=\r\nnalysis on the\nfull link-containing content, to create the web graph.\n\n- Go=\r\nrdon\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
