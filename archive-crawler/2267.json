Not as such, althoug=\r\nh there was an issue with Heritrix builds \n&gt; failing on\n&gt; &gt; 2.6 kernels at =\r\nsome point. Myself, I&#39;m running on Red Hat, but \n&gt; that is\n&gt; &gt; simply becau=\r\nse thats what we use here, not because Heritrix runs \n&gt; better on\n&gt; &gt; it. (=\r\nMichael, I think there should be a FAQ entry for this \n&gt; question). Just\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; make sure you&#39;ve got Java 1.4.2 or better installed and you \nshould \n&gt; be=\r\n fine. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2. Depends on the hardware. Assuming that there are enoug=\r\nh \nactive \n&gt; queues\n&gt; &gt; (meaning the KB/sec is not limited by politness rul=\r\nes) the \ncrawler \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; capable of (in my experiance) going as high 21.1=\r\n Mbits/sec (over \na \n&gt; period of\n&gt; &gt; 24 hours). Peak loads can be higher, e=\r\nspecially if you are \n&gt; downloading a lot\n&gt; &gt; of larger files. If many craw=\r\nling text documents, bandwidth \nusage \n&gt; drops,\n&gt; &gt; since each text documen=\r\nt is subjected to link extraction that \n&gt; takes time.\n&gt; &gt; The throughput in=\r\n terms of documents per second for the 24 hour \n&gt; period cited\n&gt; &gt; above wa=\r\ns approx. 57 docs/sec. (about 5 million docs and 214GB of\n&gt; &gt; uncompressed =\r\ndata in 24 hours).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The hardware in question includes dual Xeon pr=\r\nocessors and 2 \ngigs \n&gt; worth of\n&gt; &gt; memory (+ abundant disk storage). Heri=\r\ntrix likes processor power \n&gt; in my\n&gt; &gt; experience, its performance is usua=\r\nlly limited by this factor \n&gt; although\n&gt; &gt; additional memory can somewhat i=\r\nmprove throughput for high end \n&gt; machines.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3. Yep, read the User=\r\n Manual. It has a section on installation \n&gt; and &quot;A quick\n&gt; &gt; guide to runn=\r\ning your first crawl job&quot; which should get you up \nand \n&gt; running\n&gt; &gt; in no=\r\n time. \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#tutorial\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; - Kris\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: archive-crawler=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; [mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of =\r\n\ncallforshadab\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 21. okt=F3ber 2005 11:02\n&gt; &gt; To: archive-crawler@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [archive-crawler] can Anybody tell me, Why shou=\r\nld i Use\n&gt; &gt; HERITRIX....... ???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am planning =\r\nto work with Heritrix.
