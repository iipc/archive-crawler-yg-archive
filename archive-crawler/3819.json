We plan to crawl twice a \nyear and obviously a=\r\n lot of content will not change across these crawls \nresulting in many dupl=\r\nicates (I&#39;ve noticed some sites have not been \nupdated since 2004!).\n\nIt&#39;d =\r\nbe great to hear if anyone has analyzed this type of question \nbefore (part=\r\nicularly with Government domains).  We would like to use \nthis info to esti=\r\nmate how much space / bandwidth will be needed when \nrepeating domain crawl=\r\ns with a &quot;smart&quot; crawler that uses deduplication.\n\ncheers\nAdam\n\n\n"}}
