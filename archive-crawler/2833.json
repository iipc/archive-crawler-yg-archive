There may be more information in heritrix_out.log. Can\nyou look through that file for any SEVERE lines that correspond to the\nalerts, and forward those?

It occurs that some\n&gt;&gt;&gt; domains needs specials configurations and I&#39;m doing this with\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Refinement (one for each site that has this need).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Basically these refinements are made to restrict the crawler by a URI\n&gt;&gt;&gt; RegExp. When a URI matches the regular expression it will not be\n&gt; crawled.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; But I&#39;m having troubles with this approach, because a great number of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; alerts are being generated. The alerts are 2 (they appear many times\n&gt;&gt;&gt; during a job):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; SEVERE           if-match-return(in processor LinksScoper)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; SEVERE           enabled(in processor LinksScoper)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m having memory&#39;s troubles (java heap space exceeds) and I think\n&gt;&gt;&gt; these alerts may be the cause. At this moment there are more than\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 500.000 alerts.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; So, anyone could help me solve this problem? Or how can I modify the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; heritrix.properties file to don&#39;t launch these alerts?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Andr� Lanna\n\n\n\n"}}
