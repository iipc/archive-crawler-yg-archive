I&#39;m \njust looking at code).\n\nHave you verified with a browser there is a page at \nhttp://foo.org/testing/person%27s-stuff?\n\nAre you looking at the logs on disk or via the UI?  Which log? I&#39;m \nhaving trouble figuring how http://foo.org/testing/person%27s-stuff \n&lt;http://foo.org/testing/person%27s-stuff&gt; becomes \nhttp://foo.org/testing/person& &lt;http://foo.org/testing/person&&gt;\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So my theory is that somewhere in the processor queue, something\n&gt; (either my code or Heritrix) is turning this into &quot;, and then\n&gt; something else is looking for & as query parameter and truncating it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Has anyone else run into this before? Any idea where I should look?\n&gt;\n&gt; Will.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
