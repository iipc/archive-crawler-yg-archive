Our larger tasks \ntherefore could not be accomplished with Heritrix.\n\nMichael Stack recommended that we migrate from Heritrix 1.3 to Heritrix \n1.5, and this was done.  However, I am finding only marginally better \nmemory consumption numbers with Heritrix 1.5.  For a task that is \npartway completed that has 320,000 scanned documents and 660,000 queued \ndocuments, the base memory consumption seems to be about 200Mb. \nExtending this to 2.5 million documents (our current task) will require \nmore than 1.6GB of JVM memory, which is better than Heritrix 1.3 but not \nby much.\n\nWe are using the default profile, with only minor changes.\n\nAny further advice?  Am I missing something?\n\nKarl\n\n"}}
