Try a comparison crawl w/o UniversalExtractor -- \nwe don&#39;t usually run with this extractor enabled.  Try a crawl w/ \nreread-seeds-on-config set to false if you&#39;ve many seeds).\n\nLike Kris, our perception is that Heritrix has gotten faster, not \nslower, of late.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\nMatt Ittigson wrote:\n\n&gt; Some change in the code between earlier today and May 31st has caused\n&gt; a massive slowdown in the speed which I&#39;m downloading data.  On the\n&gt; same machine, configured in the same way, a version of Heritrix I\n&gt; built from CVS, from earlier today, could not muster more than 30K/s\n&gt; on the same seed file that the May 31st version is currently doing\n&gt; 728K/s.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps the difference is in configuration?  Maybe I&#39;m enabling a\n&gt; newer configuration variable which is slowing things down?  The\n&gt; difference between the order.xml files are only additions in the newer\n&gt; version:\n&gt;\n&gt; reread-seeds-on-config: true\n&gt; use-bdb-for-cookies: true\n&gt; the universal extractor (with default configuration)\n&gt; LinkScoper instead of Postselector (with default configuration)\n&gt;\n&gt; Would any of the log files be of use to track down the problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; -matt\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
