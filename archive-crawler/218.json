At some point 0.3.X becomes good enough to\n&gt;&quot;release&quot;, so it becomes 0.4, and the working branch jumps to 0.5,\n&gt;etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWe could do this too.  Included below are some links that discuss the \nversioning used by the linux kernel team.\n\nSo, odd numbered MINOR (or &#39;mode&#39;) numbers are development releases \n(0.1.0, 0.3.0, 2.1.0, etc.).  Using this mechanism, we would do w/o the \njakarta &#39;-dev&#39; and &#39;-rcX&#39; qualifiers.  We could also put off branching \ntill absolutely necessary just tagging HEAD at release points only \nbranching when we want to fix a bug going against a particular release \n(John Erik Halse suggested this).  A branch could be done at any point \nin a release&#39;s life but we might still call it by the releases&#39; \nMAJOR.MINOR component anyways though we might be bug fixing version \nMAJOR.23.12 to make release MAJOR.23.13.\n\nSt.Ack\n\nhttp://www.cs.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin/linuxversion/\nhttp://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9804.3/0241.html\n\n&gt;- Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
