If \nthe &#39;http://www.mit.edu:8001/robots.txt&#39; URI appears in the crawl.log, \nseeing its full line (esp. the hopsPath and via) would be helpful.\n\nThis symptom seems to suggest that the \n&#39;http://www.mit.edu:8001/robots.txt&#39; URI was already at \nCandidateURI.HIGHEST (0) scheduling-directive, which by design should \nnot occur: most URIs are at NORMAL (3); some seeds/embeds/prerequisites \ncan be MEDIUM (2); prerequisites of those can be HIGH (1); and \nprerequisites of those can be HIGHEST (0). There really shouldn&#39;t be any \nprerequisite-of-prerequisite (&#39;PP&#39;) synthetic hops-paths -- and even a \n2-long path should be a very rare event.\n\nUsing the form- or http-auth login features (which also schedule \n&#39;prerequisite&#39; URIs) might make such hops-paths more likely; are those \nin use on this crawl?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
