I checked out HEAD via sourceforge\ncvs and I added two more class for scope as suggested.  I am also\nusing Eclipse, so I did the test run on Eclipse and it works great.\n\nOne thought on DomainScope, if my seed url is dept1.siteA.com,\nDomainScope won&#39;t take dept2.siteA.com as in scope, but it does if my\nseed url is www.siteA.com becasuse we strip www[0-9] from the url.  I\nstill couldn&#39;t decide whether it is what I want or not, I am sure it\nis not hard to do that change.  I just thought it is worth mentioning.\n\nI saw the Lowercase URL rule, it seems simple enough to modify.  I&#39;ll\nsure post on the mailing list if I ever changed it.  \n\nOkie, question move to next step.  How do I deploy my changes ?  I\ntried to run maven build as in the developer&#39;s manual.  Build run but\nit failed on several Test.  And there are no files in\ntarget/distribution folder I am assuming because of test failed ? Oh,\nI am running this on windows machine because of my IDE, my production\nrun will be on Linux though.  I try to build the jar file from the\nclass folder and it runs but several errors in web browser since my\nwar file is from 1.2\n\nOne issue I notice while I am running under Eclipse, the link to\n/jobs/pending.jsp and completed.jsp are broken, I am getting 404.  I\nam not sure is it because I am under development run under eclipse ?\n\n\nOkie, it is getting a bit long.  Thanks for your time.\n\nLaters,\nJay\n \n&gt; Let me add qualification to the above.  I suggested using HEAD because\n&gt; its stablizing as we ready for 1.4 release, limited testng show no\n&gt; glaring issues, and we ourselves have been using recent versions of\n&gt; HEAD doing large crawls (HEAD also has loads of fixes, new features,\n&gt; and lasts much longer before OOME&#39;ing).  That said, for &#39;production\n&gt; purposes&#39;, you should always use released versions of Heritrix (For\n&gt; what you&#39;re trying to do, there is no change in canonicalization rules\n&gt; API so it should be easy bringing forward 1.2 rules).\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n\n\n\n\n"}}
