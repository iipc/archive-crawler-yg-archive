However, I think that will work for you to again \nview your job&#39;s reports in the web UI -- it just did in my test.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nstuart_white1 wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m a new Heritrix user, and I&#39;m using Heritrix 1.14.2.  In the web\n&gt; gui, I was clicking through the reports (on the Jobs page, under\n&gt; Completed Jobs), curious to see what each report provided. \n&gt; Unfortunately, I was careless, and clicked on the last link (Delete)\n&gt; before I realized what it was.\n&gt; \n&gt; I ssh&#39;ed onto the box, and it appears all of the info for the job is\n&gt; still there under $HERITRIX_HOME/jobs.  I see state.job contains the\n&gt; word &quot;Deleted&quot;.  I tried changing this to be &quot;Finished&quot;, but the job\n&gt; still does not appear in the web gui.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a way to undelete a job&#39;s reports, so I can view them again\n&gt; through the web gui?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
