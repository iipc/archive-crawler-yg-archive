However, I found that\n&gt; the local drive is=\r\n not big enough so I mounted an external drive in NFS type\n&gt; and change the=\r\n &quot;heritrix.jobsdir&quot; to a directory in the NFS mounted drive.\n&gt; This causes =\r\na problem as the crawler does not crawl. In &quot;state.job&quot; file, it\n&gt; reports =\r\nthat \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A fatal InitializationException occured when loading job:\n&gt; On =\r\ncrawl: crawltest Unable to setup bdb environment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I should say that h=\r\neritrix should have writing permission to this folder\n&gt; because the &quot;logs&quot; =\r\n&quot;scratch&quot; and &quot;checkpoints&quot; folders are all created and\n&gt; &quot;order.xml&quot; file =\r\nis there, too. \n&gt; \n&gt; I read some posts before and kind of get an impression=\r\n that this error may\n&gt; be caused by using an NFS mounted drive.
