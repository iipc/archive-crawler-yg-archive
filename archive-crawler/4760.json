Now, when I create a job\n&gt; using that profile it works fine. I just ran a crawl on a website, and\n&gt; all the URL&#39;s are resolving their DNS IP addresses.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I look at the default profile. I realize I don&#39;t know much about\n&gt; configuring a crawl job on Heritrix. Could use some more documentation\n&gt; on what all the modules do, and when to use them.\n\nThere is much documentation on 1.x in the user manual:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/index.html\n\nSettings in the web UI have at least a brief description of their \npurpose and usual default value. Also, once you supply an alternate \nimplementation class for a &#39;module&#39; or &#39;submodule&#39; (on those respective \nconfiguration pages), an &#39;info&#39; or &#39;?&#39; link will further describe the \nchosen implementation.\n\nBeyond those, the mailing list archives, project wiki, and source code \n(viewable online at http://crawler.archive.org/xref/index.html ) are the \nnext line of reference.\n\n(In 2.x, there will be links from the web UI to documentation pages \nanyone can improve on the project wiki.)\n\n&gt; What software do you guys use to read the ARC files generated by a crawl?\n\nThere&#39;s the ArcReader class bundled in Heritrix:\n\n  http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/io/arc/ARCReader.html\n\nThere are also the tools available at the companion &#39;archive-access&#39; \nSourceforge project:\n\n  http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/\n\n...which include contributed ARC readers in C++ (libarc, from Tom \nEmerson) and Python (Hedaern, from Mark Williamson of HanzoWeb).\n\nThere is also the Perl &#39;BNF Arc Tools&#39; from the Bibliothï¿½que nationale \nde France:\n\n  http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BnfArcTools\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
