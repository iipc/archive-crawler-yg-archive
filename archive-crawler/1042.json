Looking at the source code, I see a lot of\n&gt;static fields in Heretrix.java that need to be initialized in ways\n&gt;that are only accessible from the outside from the main() method.\n&gt;\n&gt;I think Heretrix would be more flexible if these static configuration\n&gt;parameters were in a single instance, or better yet, behind an\n&gt;interface that outsiders (like myself) could implement.\n&gt;\n&gt;Just an idea.  What do you think?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWe could do that.  Or perhaps it&#39;d be better if they could be \ninitialized from a properties file or system properties.
