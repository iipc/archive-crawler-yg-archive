I guess I&#39;m a bit confused on=\r\n what exactly is considered a hop?\n\n2. is there a way to ignore paths with =\r\nurl&#39;s longer than a certain length? like if I don&#39;t want to download url&#39;s =\r\nlonger than 140 characters?\n\n3. besides using file size or # bytes download=\r\ned from a particular site, is there a way to cap the amount of content that=\r\n comes from a certain domain? for example if blog.com is a blog and has ton=\r\ns of archive pages that I don&#39;t want to grab, is there a way to filter thos=\r\ne out?\n\n4. what is a good resource for learning how to use regular expressi=\r\nons for the pattern filters and such? the link that the user manual provide=\r\ns is broken. :(\n\nThanks for any help/insight.\n\n\n"}}
