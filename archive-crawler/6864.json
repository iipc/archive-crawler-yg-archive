Then, the web UI will always see logs up\n&gt;=\r\n to the latest line, but when not being watched the logs would flush less\n&gt;=\r\n frequently.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/29/10 9:54 AM, Gordon Mohr wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Good catch; the side-effects of this batching on monitoring a crawl\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; through crawl.log were unintended.
