I know at least two other people have gone over this\n&gt; before on the list, but has their code ever been suggested for\n&gt; incorporation or made public?  (I&#39;ve e-mailed them, but thought I&#39;d\n&gt; ask here just in case).\nWe&#39;ve not see hide nor hair round these parts.\n&gt;\n&gt; The second is a programmatic interface to the WorkQueue;  I would like\n&gt; to start a crawl with an empty queue, and as a result of processing\n&gt; elsewhere, in another program, insert seeds into the queue remotely.\n&gt; Has anyone\n&gt; written anything for this?\nHave you considered using JMX to do this?  The API allows remote \nsubmission of seeds.  See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#mon_com for more on \nremote control of Heritrix. Also of note, its possible to set the \ncrawler to pause on start and have it wait on submission of seeds, etc.  \nSame can be done for end-of-crawl: rather than die after all URLs have \nbeen exhausted, the crawler can be set to go into a holding pattern.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Kjerken\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Computer security \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+security&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=BHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWDg&gt; \n&gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+training&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=v0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
