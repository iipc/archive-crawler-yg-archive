Give it a try and let us know what  \nyou think.\n\n&gt; I think the sense of structure is a fairly important baby to be  \n&gt; throwing\n&gt; out with the bathwater.\n&gt;\nUsually overrides aren&#39;t structured at all.\n\n&gt; We&#39;re actually in NetarchiveSuite moving\n&gt; towards something that&#39;s uses the XML structure more rather than  \n&gt; seeing\n&gt; it as key-value pairs.\n&gt;\nCan you divulge any more details about that? I&#39;m particularly  \ninterested in how XML-vs-non-XML sheets would affect your integration  \nwith us.\n\n&gt; It&#39;s obviously bad to have a different format for modifying sheets,  \n&gt; but\n&gt; couldn&#39;t the JMX API use XML instead, passing arbitrary parts of a  \n&gt; sheet\n&gt; XML?\n&gt;\nWell, then we&#39;d be using two APIs for configuration management.\n\n&gt; I get nervous twitches every time I see something evolve from fairly\n&gt; simple to having its own type system (having done that too many times\n&gt; myself:). It&#39;s a sign that it&#39;s getting too complex.\n&gt;\nThe 2.0 settings system uses the same types as the the 1.x settings  \nsystem. There are simple and complex types; complex types can be  \nmodules, maps or lists. 2.0 adds some new simple types (Java  \nenumerations, and java.util.regex.Pattern), and uses Java generics  \nwhere possible. Also in 1.x, module types had to extend from a base  \nclass; in 2.x this is not strictly required, though we do encourage  \nmodule writers to implement a Module tagging interface.\n\n&gt; We&#39;ve talked occasionally about using Spring for settings. I don&#39;t  \n&gt; know\n&gt; yet if Spring is the best, but wouldn&#39;t it be more reasonable to  \n&gt; follow\n&gt; some kind of standard for settings files rather than re-inventing the\n&gt; wheel (much as that is a favorite passtime of programmers:)?\n&gt;\nI&#39;m actually a fan of Spring, but it turned out not to be a good  \nmatch for Heritrix&#39;s needs.\n\nSpring configuration files would be great for establishing the global  \nconfiguration, but the value of a module&#39;s setting depends on the URI  \ncurrently being processed. Eg, you might want to set the Frontier to  \nallow some domains to be crawled faster than others, or you might not  \nwant to crawl certain paths on one server but still crawl other paths  \non that same server.  There&#39;s no direct way to express those sorts of  \noverrides using Spring (let alone our somewhat strange way of adding  \noverride elements to lists and maps).\n\nIndirectly, we could have one standard Spring config for the global  \nconfiguration, and use some custom format for describing the  \noverrides. But then we&#39;d need to write custom code for injecting the  \noverrides into the main Spring config, then using Spring to  \nregenerate the override configuration for the URI. That seemed overly  \nburdensome to have to do for every URI.\n\n-Paul\n\n\n"}}
