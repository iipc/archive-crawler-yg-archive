Still, any changes required for \nNetBeans should be minor.\n\nTo actually build distribution packages, exactly like those from the \nbuild box or official releases, a older version of Maven is used for H1. \nMore details are in the H1 developer manual:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual/building.html#N10050\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/2/10 10:21 PM, Mohammad Amin Golshani wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; hi all\n&gt; i am going to extract web graph during crawling process, i choose\n&gt; heritrix-1.14.4 and after spend some days for reading its code, now i&#39;m\n&gt; going to recompile its code within netbeans 6.9, but there are some\n&gt; problems, even i place some directories like &quot;conf&quot; and &quot;profiles&quot; in\n&gt; the project directory. but during compile process i encounter some\n&gt; exceptions.\n&gt; where is the problem !!!?\n&gt; does any body have same problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
