This means, I have on=\r\nly 42 hosts with uncrawled URIs left. But this can&#39;t be true since when I l=\r\nook into the hosts-report, one of the seed hosts has only 163 crawled URLs =\r\nand does not appear to be in an active frontierany longer since I can not f=\r\nind it in the frontier-summary-report. Since this host should have way more=\r\n crawlable URLs, I wonder what went wrong. \nIs my assumption correct? How c=\r\nan I inspect the exhausted queues? \n\nRobert\n\n\n"}}
