T=\r\nhe crawl does work just fine and displays the feed perfectly. What obviousl=\r\ny doesn&#39;t work is the link rewriting. When I select a link it points to the=\r\n live web version of the article instead of the archived version. The artic=\r\nles are crawled though and when I insert the link into the Wayback Machine =\r\nit is found.\n\nI wonder if I missed a configuration or if this is a shortcom=\r\ning due to the xml-content?\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nSteph\n\n\n"}}
