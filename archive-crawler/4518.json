Links that are not in the scope are \ndisregarded. The links that are in the scope are &quot;promoted&quot; to \nCandidateURIs (if not CandidateURIs already) and later scheduled to be \ncrawled.\n\nThe decide rules of the LinkScoper itself simply decide if the\nLinkScoper will be skipped the next processor in the processor chain or not.\n\nIf the LinkScoper is skipped, I believe that getting ClassCastException \nerrors is to be expected.  The extractors create Link and not \nCandidateURI links needed by Scheduler. However, if you use your own \nextractors that create CAndidateURI links, skipping the LinkScoper \nsimple means that all extracted links will be scheduled.\n\nIf you want to reject already schedule links, that can be done with \nPreselector&#39;s options like recheck-scope, block-all and etc.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\ntsasaki28 wrote:\n&gt; Hi all. I have just started to use Heritrix 1.12.1\n&gt; and roughly succeeded in simple crawls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I&#39;m switching to control the scope of my crawl finely.\n&gt; I added some rules rejecting unwilling URIs in LinkScoper.\n&gt; It causes java.lang.ClassCastException in the processor &#39;Scheduler&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have not read sources but I am wondering that \n&gt; LinkScoper converts Links comming from link extractors\n&gt; to CandidateURI which Scheduler needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could anyone tell me whether rejecting URIs in LinkScoper \n&gt; is correct use or not ? If it is incorrect, should I reject\n&gt; unwilling URIs in the Scheduler (Scheduler#decide-rules) \n&gt; which comes just after LinkScoper module.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
