The AList is just such a handy place to stuff\napplication-related information.  My desire is to pass info from the\nparent CrawlURI&#39;s AList to the child CandidateURI (who currently does\nnot have an AList -- I wish it did!).  I guess I&#39;ll have to subclass\nCandidateURI to get this.  \n\nSo a protected createCandidateURI is a promising direction.  If this\nmethod could take the parent CrawlURI as well as the other stuff and\nreturn a new CandidateURI, then all might be possible.  Could you add\ncuri to the arguments passed to createCandidateURI?  Or maybe it would\nbe neater to pass just the curi&#39;s AList to the method?  \n\nThanks so much for working on this.  I think Heritrix has great\npotential for being THE open-source crawler. - D.\n\n --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@a...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; bergmark_d wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ooops, not so elegant.  Referring to my post\n&gt; &gt; just a little earlier, --- there is no ref to\n&gt; &gt; the Parent URI (&quot;curi&quot;) in the schedule method.\n&gt; &gt; So will be hard to copy info from parent to\n&gt; &gt; child URI.  This needs more thought.\n&gt; &gt; D.\n&gt; \n&gt; Try &#39;CandidateURI#getVia&#39;.  Returned type is Object but in an\n&gt; override context should always be an UURI instance.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also did some more refactoring.  I made handleLinkCollection\n&gt; protected (handlePrerequisites already was protected rather than \n&gt; private) and added createCandidateUri, a method that both\n&gt; handleLinkCollection and handlePrerequisites use to create a\nCandidateURI instance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us know if this is still not sufficent -- or if you have better \n&gt; refactoring suggestion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bergmark_d&quot;\n&lt;bergmark@C...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I believe making Postselector:schedule protected will do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the trick. The main problem will be that CandidateURI&#39;s have no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; AList (I wish they did!)  But thanks much -- this is an elegant \n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution.  I&#39;ll let you know if I have any problems with this. \nD.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stackarchiveorg&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;stack@a...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bergmark_d&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bergmark@C...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi, all -- One nice feature of Mercator was the ability for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the CrawlURI (docBundle in Mercator) to carry history along \n&gt; &gt; with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus you could not only make the crawl uri pass information\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from one processor to the next, but a parent URI could pass\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information to child URIs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For adaptive focused crawling, it is very helpful to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; able to pass miscellaneous information from parent pages to\nchildren.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.  Makes sense.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Heritrix, I can see where attributes could be copied into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; child URIs -- in the handleLinkCollection method of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Postselector class, for example, when the CandidateURI is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formed.  So I would like to extend Postselector and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over-ride just this one method, but it is private.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How do you all decide which methods to make protected and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which private?  Maybe it would be nice to allow the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; application programmer to add attributes to the\nCandidateURI \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before it goes onto the frontier, perhaps by some call-back\nor by factoring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out a protected and over-ridable method that decorates the\n&gt; &gt; CandidateURI.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I made the Postselector#schedule method protected so you can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; override it in HEAD.  Is this sufficent?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n--------------------------------------------------\n----------------------\n&gt; &gt; *Yahoo!
