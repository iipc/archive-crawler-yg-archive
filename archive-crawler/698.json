We used\n&gt; &gt;to determine it using an old crawler we have. We&#39;d like to use\n&gt; &gt;heritrix to do the same thing, but I dont know what in the API I use\n&gt; &gt;to determine how far a page is from the starting page. Some one had\n&gt; &gt;mentioned hopsfilter class, but I really dont understand it or have\n&gt; &gt;any proper documentation to go by. Any help would be greatly\nappreciated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Regards,\n&gt; &gt;Ahnu\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Would you be asking these questions post-crawl? There is perl script in \n&gt; the bin directory called hoppath.pl that looks at crawl.log files.  If \n&gt; you give it a URI, it will list the referrers the crawler followed to \n&gt; get from initial &#39;seed&#39; URI to queried URI (See the head of the script \n&gt; for notes on edits that need to be made before it can be run).\n&gt; \n&gt; Otherwise, regards what to use in the API, Heritrix has classes that \n&gt; bundle URIs and their state (CandidateURI, CrawlURI).  Part of the\nstate \n&gt; kept by a URI is the path from the initial &#39;seed&#39; URI.  See \n&gt; CandidateURI#pathFromSeed here \n&gt;\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/datamodel/CandidateURI.html#57).\n \n&gt; See here in CrawlScope for an example of counting hops: \n&gt;\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/framework/CrawlScope.html#247.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
