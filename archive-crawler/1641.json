The\n&gt; problem\n&gt; is that it waits for about 15 minutes or something\n&gt; like it, that&#39;s ways to long in my eyes... Now my\n&gt; question is, where the setting for the duration of\n&gt; the\n&gt; timeout can be found and (hopefully) changed (if\n&gt; there\n&gt; is a setting for it at all...)\n&gt; \nHmm i just remarked that i was wrong because i had a\nqueue snoozing but it still continued to crawl (i\nguess it just stopped crawling last time cuz there was\nnothing else to do...) but there&#39;s still a question\nopen: How is the &quot;sleep time&quot; calculated for a\nsnoozing queue cuz this time it snoozed for a few\nseconds? \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nCelebrate Yahoo!&#39;s 10th Birthday! \nYahoo!
