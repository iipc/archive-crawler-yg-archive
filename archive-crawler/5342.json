I&#39;m trying to\n&quot;avoid starvation&quot; o=\r\nf sites that do not have many links in them on\neach page by other sites who=\r\n do, and if I&#39;m not mistaken, will &quot;take\nover&quot; the crawl frontier after a f=\r\new iterations.\n\nMy other option is to run many crawl engines, one per site,=\r\n but this\nseems cumbersome and is probably less scaleable.\n\nThanks,\n-Nick\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
