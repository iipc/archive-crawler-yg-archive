Is it possible to have a greater throughput by \n&gt; instructing heritrix to ignore its default politeness policy and be more \n&gt; aggressive(rather rude), where we can have more than one thread crawling \n&gt; the same site.\n\nThe best currently possible is to set all the politeness delays to\nzero; the assumption that Heritrix should only open a single\nconnection to a server at once is fairly deep in the design. (And,\na previous attempt to enable multiple connections in an older\nFrontier implementation was flaky and is no longer supported.)\n\nIf you&#39;re crawling your own server over a fast local link, I&#39;m\nalso not sure multiple connections would improve throughput\nthat much -- they&#39;d be competing with each other for the available\nbandwidth/server-effort.\n\nSee also this message for mostly the same points:\n  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2109\n\n(There might be a trick possible, to get multiple connections per server,\nby making a custom QueueAssignmentPolicy that splits URIs from a single\nhost across multiple synthetic queues, rather than a single queue based on\nthe hostname, but I haven&#39;t looked at what else such an approach might\nbreak.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Prasen\n&gt; \n&gt; Gordon Mohr (@Internet Archive) wrote on 9/14/2005, 11:23 AM:\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; Prasenjit wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;  From what I understand, if I use SURTPrefix and just provide a single\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; seed, it should crawl only those URIs which are residing on the seeded\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; host.  What this also implies is that at any point of time there should\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; be only 1 toe-thread running, because of the same-host politeness\n&gt;  &gt; policy.\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; Are my assumptions/understanding correct ?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Mostly. However, by default Heritrix also assumes that if you&#39;ve\n&gt;  &gt; retrieved\n&gt;  &gt; a page, you want the inline resources necessary to render the page (aka\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;embeds&quot;) as well -- images, frames, etc. -- even if they are on other\n&gt;  &gt; hosts.\n&gt;  &gt; The same thing goes for an HTTP redirect response -- it&#39;s presumed if you\n&gt;  &gt; requested the first URI, you want whatever it redirected to. So those can\n&gt;  &gt; result in parallel fetches off your exact host/prefix.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
