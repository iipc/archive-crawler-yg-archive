I just fixed this.  I \nalso changed the way we do the SinkHandler registration so its no longer \nnecessary to put SinkHandler class into commons/endorsed so can be found \nby tomcat when its loading up logging handlers (Build 782+ will have the \nfixes.  See here: \nhttp://crawltools.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/buildresults/HEAD-heritrix).\n\nSeems like above fixes make us work again in tomcat 5.0.28 and in 4.x \nbut there is still an issue deploying Heritrix in tomcat-5.5.9 that I \nneed to look into.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n"}}
