This other info appears in lines\n  which never begin with a digit character. \n\n* Legend lines, specifically, begin with a &quot;:&quot; character, and \n  list field names in their relative positions. \n\nWith this in mind, the core logs for Heritrix (without \nconsidering eventual checkpointing):\n\n - uri-processing.log\n\n   Per-URI disposition, such as success or failure. \n   Roughly equivalent to Mercator&#39;s &quot;timings&quot; + \n   &quot;dns-error&quot; (since DNS lookups are treated as\n   any other URIs).\n\n - crawl-progress.log\n \n   Sampling of crawler state/progress at configurable\n   intervals; like Mercator&#39;s &quot;crawl-log&quot;.\n\n - crawl-errors.log\n\n   Serious errors, such as unhandled exceptions \n   conditions that cannot be retried/classified as\n   a matter of policy. \n\n - uri-errors.log\n\n   URIs which are discovered but are too problematic to\n   crawl.\n\nTentative formats for each:\n\nuri-processing.log\n\n[timestamp] [status-code] [length] [URI] [mime-type] \n\ncrawl-progress.log\n\n(exactly as in Mercator&#39;s crawl-log, namely:)\n\n[timestamp] [discovered-pages] [pending-pages] [downloaded-pages] [unique-pages] &#92;\n [overall-docs-per-sec] [current-docs-per-sec] [overall-KB-sec] [current-KB-sec] &#92;\n [download-failures] [stalled-threads] [memory-usage]\n\ncrawl-errors.log\n\n[timestamp] [URI-if-possible] [error-message-if-available]\n...and on subsequent non-timestamped lines, arbitrary other\ninfo, such as a stack dump.\n\nuri-errors.log\n\n[timestamp] [source-URI] [error-message-if-available] [problem-URI]\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n"}}
