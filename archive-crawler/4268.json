I&#39;ve already widely used the same version on\n&gt; Win XP HOME EDITION, but I don&#39;t remember any problem in\n&gt; configuration. I only remember I&#39;ve replaced the jmxremote.password\n&gt; where need and replaced @PASSWORD@ with letmein in those file.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I try, from command line, to launch heritrix in this way, the\n&gt; output is like the follow lines:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; - Login and password have not been specified (see --admin switch)\n&gt;&gt; - another program uses the port for the web UI (8080 by default)\n&gt;  (e.g. another Heritrix instance)\n&gt;&gt; - JMX password file is missing or permissions not set correctly\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Do you want to try to fix the permissions (Y/N)?\n&gt; \n&gt; When I choose Y, it returns this second set of output:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Restart Heritrix (Y/N)?Y\n&gt;&gt; WARNING: It&#39;s currently not possible to run Heritrix in background  \n&gt;      &gt;on Windows. It was just started minimized in a new Window and\n&gt; will be &gt;shut down as soon as you log off.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Either fixing the permissions failed or there was another problem.\n&gt;&gt; You may have to set the ownership of the file \n&gt;&gt; &#92;Programmi&#92;Java&#92;heritrix-1.12.0&#92;jmxremote.password\n&gt;&gt; manually to yourself (%USERNAME%) and restrict the access to &gt;read-only.\n&gt; \n&gt; where %USERNAME% is my username in windows account.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve read the FAQ and all the correlated articles\n&gt; (http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~schoefma/howto/run_heritrix_on_windows/\n&gt; for example).\n&gt; \n&gt; I also tried to modify permission in all the way. \n&gt; What&#39;s wrong?
