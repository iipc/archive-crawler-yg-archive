With this seed crawling worked fine.\n\nNow I tried to use ot=\r\nher random seed domains (e.g. http://www.archive.org) and suddenly my crawl=\r\n stalls right at the start?!?\n\nIf I use the IP adresses instead of the doma=\r\nin names as seeds the crawl stops and does not stall!?\n\nI get &quot;Failed to cr=\r\nawl seed, will retry&quot; in the seed report.\n\nI tried it with the standard unc=\r\nhanged 2.0.2 distribution and the standard profiles and got the same result=\r\n?!?\n\nAnyone got an explanation for this strange behavior?\n\nIm running on wi=\r\nndows and from localhost:8080 from my home (which is not part of the jku.at=\r\n domain)\n\nThanks for any help\n\nGeorgie\n\n\n"}}
