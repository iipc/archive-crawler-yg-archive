I had to update the version of Jericho manually by\n&gt; patching the pom.xml because there has been a lot of OOME using the 2.3\n&gt; version, heritrix currently uses. When using the 2.6 version of Jericho\n&gt; the OOMEs disapered. If I&#39;ve finished my diploma thesis I may provide\n&gt; the code as contrib to heritrix2, if someone is interessted. Please let\n&gt; me know if this is the case and what whould be best practice to\n&gt; contribute it to the heritrix2 codebase.\n\nThanks for the offer!\n\nThe best approach to make a contribution is to...\n(1) create an issue in the Heritrix JIRA tracker\n(2) attach a patch with your changes, or full files of any new classes.\n(3) include a statement that you approve its integration to the project, \nunder its current and any future open source license. (We are \ntransitioning from LGPL-2.1 in current releases to Apache License 2 in a \nto-be-determined future release.)\n\nIn our crawls at IA, we currently use ExtractorHTML rather than the \nJerichoExtractorHTML, so we rely on others who use the Jericho version \nto suggest fixes and improvements.\n\nAny feature that&#39;s well-tested, of interest to other users, and without \na complexity/performance cost on those who choose not to use it is a \ngood candidate for inclusion in the core distribution. Discussion is \nwelcome here or in a tracking JIRA issue about candidate contributions.\n\nEven if a contribution is of more narrow interest, we&#39;d welcome it \nliving in our issue tracker or project wiki so it can be discovered and \nintegrated by other users who customize the crawler. We might also add a \n&#39;contrib&#39; directory to a future release, if we had a variety of \ncontributions that we didn&#39;t want to mix with the default core but still \nwanted to make available.\n\nRegarding the Jericho 2.3 versus 2.6 memory issues: there is a previous \nissue requesting an upgrade to the 2.4 version:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1146\n\nBased on your report of improvements with 2.6, I will be upgrading the \nheritrix (1.x) and heritrix2 trunks to use that version, unless I hear \nobjections from others using the JerichoHTMLExtractor.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n"}}
