First off, I havent really scrutinized the heritrix source/documentat=\r\nion, but as I got it from the logs, the SeedModule has been addressed just =\r\nonce, in the beginning of a crawl, saying announceSeeds(). Is it possible t=\r\no somehow manually call the announceSeeds() method? It would even be better=\r\n if I could call it in a given interval, to see if there are new seeds in t=\r\nhe database.\nSecondly, when a job is first run, if no seeds are available i=\r\nn the database, the job finishes (or pauses before finishing) right away. A=\r\nny suggestions on how I could pause the job and from time to time poll the =\r\ndatabase to see if new seeds available?\nThanks in advance and highly apprec=\r\niate any suggestions.\n\nRegards,\nprogre55\n\n\n"}}
