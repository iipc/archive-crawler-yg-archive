For example, you \ncould place it just after the Preselector.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nnfoscarini wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have a seed which has 671 domains listed. For each seed I limit\n&gt;&gt; scope of the crawl, but I want to limit it to no more then 300\n&gt;&gt; documents per seed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is this possible?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I was searching the source code, and I found something called\n&gt; &quot;QuotaEnforcer&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has this description\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;A simple quota enforcer. If the host, server, or frontier group\n&gt; associated with the current CrawlURI is already over its quotas,\n&gt; blocks the current URI&#39;s processing with S_BLOCKED_BY_QUOTA.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds like what I need, but I&#39;m not sure where to install this\n&gt; in the sheet?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
