I managed to read the list of files \ncontains in the ARC. I can read the html file as it is in plain text \nformat but not with other format such as .jpg and .pdf.\n\nHow do I extract the jpg and pdf file?\n\nNotice that reading each record is slow. Normally users will write \njava file using arcreader class to get all records in one time, am I \nright? Any other ways?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBesides that, I was just using the basic setting that run the test. \nWhenever there are file formats other than plain text. Do I need to \nexplicitly specify any setting?\n\n\nThanks,\nInn Fang\n\n\n\n\n"}}
