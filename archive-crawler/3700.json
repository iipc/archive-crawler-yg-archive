If \n&#39;nobelprize.org&#39; was not one of the target domains of the DomainScope \n(from the seeds), it would only be crawled because of &#39;transclusion&#39;.\n\nSetting the &#39;max-speculative-hops&#39; to &#39;0&#39; should prevent this from being \nin-scope, but would affect all other &#39;X&#39; hops as well. (All links found \nin Javascript, Flash, and other non-HTML content are usually &#39;X&#39; type -- \nwe don&#39;t know for sure if they&#39;re only followed when clicked &#39;L&#39; or \nnecessary to render their referrer &#39;E&#39;.)\n\nIn CVS HEAD (and upcoming 1.10.2 release), ExtractorHTML has a new \n&#39;extract-javascript&#39; flag which, if set to &#39;false&#39;, will prevent all \nattempts to extract from Javascript inside HTML (&#39;&lt;script&gt;&#39; tags and \n&#39;javascript:&#39; URIs). (If you generally want to extract such links, but \nnot on some problem sites, you could set this false only in an override.)\n\nIf you needed to get really fancy, it should be possible to exclude just \nlinks found inside &#39;onclick&#39; (or other &#39;on___&#39;) attributes, using the \n&#39;viaContext&#39; value saved on discovered links and a custom exclusion \nfilter (either in Java or inside a BeanshellDecideRule). Let me know if \nyou need more information about this option.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
