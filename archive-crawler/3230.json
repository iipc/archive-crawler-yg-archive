But that can just\n&gt; &gt; add to the nu=\r\nmber of things you need to keep track of; even\nexperienced \n&gt; &gt; crawl opera=\r\ntors at IA often get these backwards.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; DecideRules add a little mor=\r\ne complexity but are more explicit in\ntheir\n&gt; &gt; intended effects:\n&gt; &gt;   - t=\r\nhey answer ACCEPT, REJECT, or PASS\n&gt; &gt;   - by chaining them, with some PASS=\r\nes, they can achieve most of the\n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt;     results that would require =\r\ndeep nesting of binary filters (with\n&gt; &gt;     logical combiners like AND/OR)=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   - in chains, the last non-PASS decision &#39;wins&#39;\n&gt; &gt;   - by convention=\r\n, pairs of DecideRule implementations are used,\ninstead\n&gt; &gt;     of a settin=\r\ng that inverts their conditional\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; An illustrative example is the di=\r\nfference between URIRegExpFilter, and\n&gt; &gt; the pair of DecideRules MatchesRe=\r\ngExpDecideRule and\n&gt; &gt; NotMatchesRegExpDecideRule.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With URIRegExpF=\r\nilter, you can answer only true or false. You need to\n&gt; &gt; consider what ans=\r\nwer the context requires, and via the\n&#39;if-match-return&#39;\n&gt; &gt; setting, you ca=\r\nn control whether a regex match means &#39;true&#39; or\n&#39;false&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But it&#39;s =\r\nquite likely that the regex is not the final word -- if it\n&gt; &gt; matches, the=\r\n URI is &#39;out&#39;, but if it fails to match, the URI may not\n&gt; &gt; necessarily be=\r\n &#39;in&#39; or &#39;out&#39; -- other rules then kick in. So the \n&gt; &gt; non-match answer ha=\r\ns to be logically combined with other filter\nresults.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the Mat=\r\nchesRegExpDecideRule or NotMatchesRegExpDecideRule,\nyou can\n&gt; &gt; arrange for=\r\n any of the following four possibilities:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ACCEPT if matches, PASS =\r\notherwise\n&gt; &gt; REJECT if matches, PASS otherwise\n&gt; &gt; ACCEPT if not matches, =\r\nPASS otherwise\n&gt; &gt; REJECT if not matches, PASS otherwise\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The named=\r\n return values constrain the usage context to interpret the\n&gt; &gt; answer in a=\r\n certain way -- no &quot;does true mean &#39;include&#39; or &#39;exclude&#39;\n&gt; &gt; here?&quot; confus=\r\nion -- and the PASS lets one rule of a group contribute\n&gt; &gt; nothing to the =\r\nfinal decision, if its condition isn&#39;t met. (No\nneed to \n&gt; &gt; wrap it in a A=\r\nND/OR to express operator intent.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (By prepending such a rule with=\r\n an all-ACCEPT or all-REJECT rule, you\n&gt; &gt; can set a &#39;default&#39; answer for P=\r\nASS.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So that DecideRules can be used anywhere Filters were, there=\r\n is a \n&gt; &gt; DecidingFilter class, which lets (chains of) DecideRules be used=\r\n to \n&gt; &gt; render a Filter true/false response. But we generally prefer to us=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; DecideRules in new contexts, and if there&#39;s a new CrawlURI-test to b=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; implemented, would like it implemented as a DecideRule rather than a=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Filter. Then it can be used in Filter contexts (via\nDecidingFilter) a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt; DecideRule contexts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Does that make sense?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Gord=\r\non @ IA\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; pandae667 wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Michael,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I just add=\r\ned 3 tiny contributions to the &quot;Feature Request&quot;\ntracker I&#39;d\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like to =\r\nsee in the forthcoming release.
