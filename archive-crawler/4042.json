This cost assignment policy basically \np=\r\nushes \n&gt; URIs with calendar like strings in them to the back of host queues=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this helps.\n\nThis looks interesting. We certainly noticed tha=\r\nt problem...the web \nis full of calendars these days.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; i.\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. If=\r\n you want to send the order.xml file(s) I would be more \nthan \n&gt; happy to t=\r\nake a look at it and see if we can help more.\n&gt; \n\nAbsolutely.
