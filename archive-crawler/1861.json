JVMs can use a signficant amount\n&gt; of memory beyond the &#39;heap&#39; space -- we&#39;ve seen hundreds of \nmegabytes\n&gt; more, especially with long-running and multi-threaded applications.\n&gt; \n&gt; The &#39;nice&#39; CPU figures below are also a little suspicious. If you\n&gt; didn&#39;t run your JVMs niced, then something else was moderately busy\n&gt; at that time, perhaps doing disk I/O.\n&gt; \n\nI forgot to mention that I started heritrix with nice so that the \nlong running crawler won&#39;t impact other activities.\n\nI have pretty much the same configuration I ran with 1.0.4 and the \nsystem does not have this problem. That leads me to think maybe it&#39;s \nsomething related to the 1.4 release.\n\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
