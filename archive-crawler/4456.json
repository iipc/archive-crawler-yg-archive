I think you just want the  \nPersistStoreProcessor as it&#39;s somewhat easier to use.\n\nMake sure you&#39;re re-using the state directory from the first crawl in  \nthe recrawl. You can either copy the state directory from the  \nprevious crawl to the new crawl, or use PersistProcessor.main as  \ndescribed in the wiki.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that you may have encountered a crawl  \ntrap. Such a trap could produce the same content over and over, but  \nwith different URIs each time. In that event the  \nFetchHistoryProcessor won&#39;t detect a duplicate due to the differing  \nURIs.\n\nHope that helps,\n\n-Paul\n\n\nOn Jul 23, 2007, at 6:05 AM, Natalia Torres wrote:\n\n&gt; Hello\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m testing Heritrix 1.12 because i&#39;m interested in dedup feature.\n&gt;\n&gt; I read on wiki notes on using the new duplication-reduction  \n&gt; functionality.\n&gt;\n&gt; What&#39;s the difference betwen use PersistLogProcessor or\n&gt; PersistStoreProcessor?\n&gt;\n&gt; I try both to get the initial crawl using my www as example and it  \n&gt; woks\n&gt; ok (getting about 700Mb on arc files).
