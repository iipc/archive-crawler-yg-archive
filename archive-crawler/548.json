A couple of idea=\r\ns .=85..\n&gt;\n&gt;(1) Shouldn&#39;t you visit the main page of a Web site more often =\r\nthan \n&gt;other URIs on lower levels, although statistics would show that the =\r\n\n&gt;front page doesn&#39;t change very often.\n\nThe idea is to most frequently vis=\r\nit pages that change most frequently. It\nhas though been suggested that the=\r\n front page (and some &#39;nearby&#39; pages) be\nexcluded from this (or at least ha=\r\nve a much lower limit on maximum wait\nbetween revisits).\n\nAn interesting fa=\r\ncet of this is, what is a &#39;main page&#39;? While this generally\nrefers to the &#39;=\r\nroot&#39; of a domain that is not always the case. Perhaps seeds\nshould be affo=\r\nrded the above mentioned special treatment...\n\n&gt;\n&gt;It&#39;s a bigger loss to mis=\r\ns changes on the main page than lose other \n&gt;changes in URIs many hops away=\r\n, in files deep down in subdirectories.\n\nAgreed. But the basic point here i=\r\ns to be able to capture all &#39;real&#39; changes\nto any of up to millions of URIs=\r\n. \n\n&gt;\n&gt;And not just the front page of a Web site, but also other URIs near =\r\n\n&gt;it.\n&gt;\n&gt;(2) What about small changes which leave page information practica=\r\nlly \n&gt;the same but are sometimes &#39;so important&#39;\n&gt;\n&gt;A Web site may have cons=\r\ntantly the same main page for a year except \n&gt;that date changes in the uppe=\r\nr right corner. The idea is to harvester \n&gt;this page only a couple of times=\r\n or once during that year.\n&gt;What if the user asks for page with date 1.1.20=\r\n05 We have to return a \n&gt;front page with date 30.6.2004, or earlier, and ex=\r\nplain that \n&gt;it&#39;s virtually the same page but was harvested only once?\n&gt;\n\nT=\r\nhis is a very good point. Hadn&#39;t really given it much though. Mostly I had\n=\r\nbeen concerned with eliminating time fields (no one is interested in\nharves=\r\nting the page each minute to capture such minute data).\n\nI would be very in=\r\nterested to hear other peoples thoughts on this. Would you\nreally be intere=\r\nsted in capturing this kind of page each day just to have\nthe right &#39;date&#39; =\r\nprinted in a header?\n\n\nThanks again for your feedback,\n- Kris \n\n\n"}}
