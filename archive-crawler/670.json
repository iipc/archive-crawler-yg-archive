Would need to profile to make sure this extra I/O didn&#39;t \ncome at some outlandish cost (General tendency should be toward \nminimizing crawl-time I/O).\n\nI added your suggestion for consideration as part of ARC file revision \nproposal: http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ArcRevisionProposal.\n\nGood man Tom,\nSt.Ack\n\nFYI: The IA header is written in the first record only, not on \nsubsequent members.\n\n\n\nTom Emerson wrote:\n\n&gt;Heritrix created GZIP members include an extra header field in the\n&gt;GZIP header indicating that they were created by the IA.\n&gt;\n&gt;What if the header field was expanded, or a new one added, that\n&gt;included the length of the *compressed* record.\n&gt;\n&gt;This could be done if the compression is done before the header is\n&gt;written. At that point we would know the size of the full member\n&gt;(header + compressed data + footer) and could plop this into the\n&gt;header, then write the whole thing to the file.\n&gt;\n&gt;A reader skips extra headers it doesn&#39;t understand. A reader that\n&gt;knows about the header could take advantage of it.\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t know if the Heritrix architecture (or the Java binding the\n&gt;zlib) would allow this, but it may be worth thinking about.\n&gt;\n&gt;    -tree\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
