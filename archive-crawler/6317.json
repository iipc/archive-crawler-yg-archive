The H3 architecture allows checkpoints to occur =\r\nmore rapidly \n&gt; than ever before, and deduplication and recrawl features wi=\r\nll in the \n&gt; future increasingly assume checkpoints are being run, and that=\r\n resuming \n&gt; a checkpointed crawl is even more common than restarting. But,=\r\n for now \n&gt; the automatic handling of files (such as renaming-them-aside in=\r\n the face \n&gt; of resumes) is still crude, and a false-start could potentiall=\r\ny foul the \n&gt; state of stored checkpoints.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Cheers=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; Tino\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
