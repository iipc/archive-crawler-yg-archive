Other than=\r\n the apparent ccTLD (.sg,.us,.uk, etc) criteria, I want to determine the &quot;n=\r\nationality&quot; of a website by its IP address.\n\nTherefore I will need to do a =\r\nIP address lookup and decide to accept a link if it lies within a range of =\r\nnetworks.\n\nI added the ExternalGeoLocationDecideRule in my DecideRuleSequen=\r\nce, but I have no idea about ExternalGeoLookupInterface. Looking at the sou=\r\nrce, it looks like I have to implement the class. After I implement the cla=\r\nss (e.g. iplookup.class), what should I fill in for Implementation? Should =\r\nit be iplookup or iplookup.class?\n\nAlso, where should I keep this class fil=\r\ne? Should I copy this class file to the DecideRule folder? Is rebuilding ne=\r\ncessary?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n"}}
