For\nexample, consider the SURT prefix:\n\n     http://(gov,\n\nThe ability to synthesize SURT prefixes from supplied seeds is an\nextra convenience. There&#39;s currently nowhere in the UI where an\noperator would enter SURT prefixes directly. You can only put them\nin an external file and refer to it by path.\n\nYou can do your (1) and (2) together -- let the seeds define some\nimplicit SURT prefixes, and also supply SURT prefixes in another\nfile. The results will be merged (and dumped to the file, if any,\nspecified as the &#39;surts-dump-file&#39;).\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nAndy Boyko wrote:\n&gt; Had some trouble with SurtPrefixScope (in 1.2.0 and HEAD), and I now\n&gt; believe the trouble is PEBKAC; please to verify?\n&gt; \n&gt; Summary: created a list of SURTs, intending to use them as crawl seeds.\n&gt;    However, it appears no permutation of config supports using just the\n&gt; SURT list as the seeds directly (based on trying it a couple of ways,\n&gt; and some cursory pawing through the code).  Tried the following things:\n&gt; \n&gt; - Entering the SURTs directly in the seed entry box, whether\n&gt; seeds-as-surt-prefix is T or F\n&gt; - Putting the SURTs in their own file, supplying the name as\n&gt; surts-source-file, but leaving the seeds entry otherwise blank\n&gt; \n&gt; Based on this experience, I&#39;m now finally starting to understand that\n&gt; SURTs are intended for scoping, not seeding, and that the way to use\n&gt; SURTs is either:\n&gt; \n&gt;   1. Enter the seeds as URLs, but use SurtPrefixScope, which will by\n&gt; default automatically convert your URLs to SURTs internally, and thus\n&gt; use the seeds as their own scope definition.\n&gt; \n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt;   2. Enter the seeds as URLs, and separately supply a SURT file to use\n&gt; as scope limiters.\n&gt; \n&gt; but not\n&gt; \n&gt;   3. Supply only SURTs as seeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Accurate?\n&gt; \n&gt; Andy Boyko   aboy@...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
