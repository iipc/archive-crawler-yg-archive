You might try again using these.\n\nThanks for taking a look and thanks for the feedback.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to trying it out...\n&gt;Andy Boyko    andy@...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
