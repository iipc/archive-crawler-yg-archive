I attempted to create a new processor module that would send files \nover HTTP POST to a server instead of writing them to ARC files.  The \nmodule seems to work, but it did not appear in the menus in the web UI. \n  I attempted to fix this by adding the module to the end of the \nprocessors.options file.  When I create a job based on the default \nprofile and add my processor, it works fine.  However, for some reason, \nwhen I create a profile that uses my new processor and base a job on \nit, it drops my processor and the postprocessors (basically, truncating \nthe list of processors where mine should be).  Does anyone know why it \nwould do this?\n\n2.  When running a crawl, the program tends to run out of memory after \nabout 0.25M URIs have been crawled.  I want the program to be able to \nrun large crawls on 0.5 GB of RAM, and the less memory used the better. \n  Another programmer suggested using database software such as BerkDB \n(http://www.sleepycat.com/products/je.shtml) to act as a sort of \nvirtual memory (storing crawl data on disk instead of in memory).  Is \nthis feasible?  Is there something else I can do to conserve memory on \nlarge crawls?\n\nThank you very much for your assistance.\nXavid Pretzer\n\n\n"}}
