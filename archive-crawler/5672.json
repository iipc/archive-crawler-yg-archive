Instead of editing conf/heritrix=\r\n.properties to enable\nverbose logging and then restarting the heritrix daem=\r\non, why not have\na no-op rule that appends to a file with details about how=\r\n a\nparticular rule sequence processed a URI (or DNS lookup).  \n\n** by defau=\r\nlt, it should stop emitting output after the first 100\nitems.  This means i=\r\nt could safely stay in place without causing any\nproblems in production. \n\n=\r\n** all the pertinent state (URI/DNS operand, fetch state, attributes,\n fina=\r\nl decision, and the submodule name) that helps in tweaking a rule\nsequence =\r\nshould be emitted with a timestamp.\n\nThis would work great for v1.x; I have=\r\n not used v2.x much yet, so I&#39;m\nnot sure how this kind of thing fits into t=\r\nhe &quot;sheet&quot; concept.\n\n(I would *not* try to implement this with the normal l=\r\nogging facility\nbecause that would complicate usage.  Consider that people =\r\nunfamiliar\nwith logging properties should be able to use it.
