If the hops \ncounting would begin on a landing page different from the home page of \nthe new site it is also ok.\n\nWe tried to configure max-hops, max-trans-hops and max-speculative-hops \nbut this are all counted from the seeds.\n\nBasically, we would like that the counting of hops would be reset \neverytime we visit a new site, independently from it is a seed or not.\n\nCould you please help us?\n\nBest regards.\n\n-- \n/Daniel Gomes\nFCCN\nAv. do Brasil, n.� 101\n1700-066 Lisboa \nTel.: +351 21 8440190 \nFax: +351 218472167 \nwww.fccn.pt\n \nAviso de Confidencialidade\n \nEsta mensagem � exclusivamente destinada ao seu destinat�rio, podendo conter informa��o CONFIDENCIAL, cuja divulga��o est� expressamente vedada nos termos da lei.
