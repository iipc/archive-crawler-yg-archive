Would there be any differenc=\r\ne if I use the same 1MM seeds for both crawlers?\n\n\nThe reason why I want to=\r\n do this is, I have 20MM seeds among 12 crawlers. I&#39;ve tested with one inst=\r\nance handling 20MM seeds and it doesn&#39;t seem to work. If I can split the se=\r\neds so that each cralwer starts with URLs that belong to themselves it shou=\r\nld make the crawl process easier....\n\nThanks,\n-Joe\n\n\n\n\n"}}
