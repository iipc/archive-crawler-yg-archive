Now I&#39;d like to get jobs started  \nin an automated way. To my understanding my options are either to use  \nJMX or to start crawls from the CLI. So I have these questions:\n\n1. Where is the documentation for starting crawls from the command  \nline? It appears there needs to be an &quot;order.xml&quot; file but this file,  \nits purpose, its format doesn&#39;t appear to be documented anywhere.  \nThere are order.xml files generated for jobs that are configured via  \nthe web UI, but attempting to use one of these on the CLI Heritrix  \njust quits without doing anything (at all, even in the foreground).\n\n2. Are there any start-to-finish/novice recipes/tutorials for JMX  \ncontrol of Heritrix? Specifically with regard to starting a crawl job  \nand other job control would be very useful. I quite like this method  \nof use because it would allow one instance to run and I could use the  \nweb UI to monitor progress and details.\n\nThanks for your time!\n- Jesse\n\n\nP.S.
