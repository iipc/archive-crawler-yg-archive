This release also includes 41 bug\nfixes or other incremental improvements, including several based on\ncommunity contributions or requests.\n\nThe only change from the Release Candidate of last month is the removal \nof the &#39;RC1&#39; identifier. This is expected to be the last major release \non the 1.X line; while a 1.14.1 (etc.) bugfix release is possible, most \nattention will be on the 2.X line, especially work towards a 2.2 major \nrelease.\n\nOnline release notes for 1.14.0 are available at:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Release+Notes+-+1.14.0\n\nProject bug/issue tracking is in a JIRA-based system:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER\n\nThe project wiki is at:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix\n\nIf you register to report/comment on JIRA issues, the same login will\nwork for wiki edits and comments.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
