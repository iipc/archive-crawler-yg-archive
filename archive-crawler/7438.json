How do you make html into plain text? \nThere is software that does that, including java libraries (see \ndiscussion here \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/240546/removing-html-from-a-java-string). \nOne thing you could do is code a custom writer that uses one of these \nlibraries. Then a question is, where does it write? It could still write \nto a warc, but if you do that you&#39;ll want to be careful that what you \nwrite conforms to the warc spec. If not warc, then you will have to come \nup with some other system, which may not be trivial.\n\nIt might make more sense to convert to plain text outside of heritrix, \nby running some postprocessing on the warcs, although that probably also \nwill not be trivial.\n\nNoah\n\nOn 12/07/2011 05:02 AM, karthiksmv wrote:\n&gt; I am using heritrix to crawl web pages and it stores information like response headers and html tags but I need to remove the response headers and html tags.
