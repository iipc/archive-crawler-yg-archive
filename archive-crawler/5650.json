The related issue is:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1038\n\nWhen in place, operators will have to provide your own server-side \nsigning certificate, so in practice this will typically be a homemade, \nself-signed certificate (which we will help Heritrix operators create if \nnecessary).\n\nAccessing the HTTPS admin interface would thus mean adding an exception \nto your desktop browser, and full vigilance would mean manually \nverifying the certificate matches what you expect at the time of \naccepting this exception. Even without full vigilance, however, this \nwould protect against casual/passive eavesdropping of the operator web \ntraffic.\n\nIn the meantime for Heritrix 1.14.x:\n\nI&#39;m guessing that the direct host:port of the Heritrix machine is \nblocked for your desktop PCs, because the organization does not want \nnormal, unencrypted HTTP traffic (including the Heritrix operator \npassword) traveling over the network from the desktop the Heritrix machine.\n\nAs a result, you&#39;re required to run the web browser on a remote trusted \nmachine that is near (or possibly the same as) the machine running \nHeritrix. (Its link to Heritrix is short and trusted for unencrypted \ntraffic.) You bring the X interface of that browser up on your desktop \nvia a secure X connection. The result is slow/awkward interactions with \nthe Heritrix web UI. Is that an accurate guess?\n\nSome alternatives that might work in the same environment, and be \nequivalently secure with less awkwardness than the X application \napproach, include:\n\n- Set up an SSH tunnel from your desktop to the &#39;trusted&#39; machine that \ncan trivially reach Heritrix. Essentially, you&#39;d then point your browser \nat http://localhost:12345/, which would go over the SSH tunnel to the \ntrusted machine, which would continue the normal connection to Heritrix. \nIf your desktop has SSH and you have an account on the trusted machine \n-- which is likely in the X scenario -- it&#39;s just a matter of the right \nSS invocation for your environment.\n\n- Have an existing HTTPS server forward part of its URL space to the \nHeritrix instance(s). This might only be a few lines of configuration on \nan existing Apache already set up with HTTPS -- mod_rewrite proxy rule(s).\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\ngrahlaura wrote:\n&gt; Because Heritrix WebUI is over http instead of https our institution\n&gt; is requiring us to use X server apps (Xming) on our PCs for access,\n&gt; which in turn has a negative impact on navigation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any chance of implementing https in a future release???\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Laura Graham\n&gt; Library of Congress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
