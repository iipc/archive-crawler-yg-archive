I am trying to figure out the way to\ncrawl the website (domain scope) + 1 external hop, not only the\nembedded image, also the html links.\n\nI have been messing with SurtScope, surtfilter + pathdepth filter on\nprefetch processor with broad scope.  Not much luck, ends up crawling\neverything until max-link-hop reach.\n\nI read through on the wiki about NewScopingModel and problems with\ncurrent scope.\n\nAny pointer or direction would be really appreciated.  \n\non the side note, here are some question I couldn&#39;t find the answer for\n1. Does the LowercaseRule change lower case only to the domain portion\nof the url or the whole string ??\n2. What is the  max-referral-hops for under the transitiveFilter ??\n\nThanks again,\nJay\n\n\n\n\n"}}
