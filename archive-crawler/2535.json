A couple questions follow:\n\nIf I run multiple i=\r\nmportUris at the same time to the same crawler, \nwould it work? It is likel=\r\ny that when doing CrawlMap, more than one \ncrawlers would import uris at th=\r\ne same time.\n\nNow the tricky question:\nHow far do people go in terms of doi=\r\nng a CrawlMap on N machines? I \nwas thinking doing a 10-machine CrawlMap on=\r\n .com domain. Each \nmachine would handle a-b.com, c-d.com, d-e.com, etc. Wo=\r\nuld you \nrecommend that? Because the immediate problem is whether the \ncomm=\r\nunication traffic would slow down the overall crawling (each \ncrawler would=\r\n take 9 import uris every hour). Is that even a \npractical approach?\n\nThat =\r\nis the only way I can think of to workaround all the memory-\nbased limitati=\r\non on heritrix for a large crawl.\n\ncheers,\n-joe\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@a...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Joe,\n&gt; \n&gt; See an ex=\r\nample here:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2438\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Take care,\n&gt; i.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
