(emphasis on try)\n&gt; \n&gt; I k=\r\nnow that controller has a direct reference to a job and since I\n&gt; name the =\r\njob before I start it, the key point would be to find that\n&gt; name inside of=\r\n a processor. Then I could integrate it perfectly. The\n&gt; job also registers=\r\n MBean representing a job so I&#39;ll try this way.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this wont get m=\r\ne to heavy drug abuse and drinking :-D.\n&gt; \n&gt; this.getController().getCurren=\r\ntJob().getName() inside of a Processor\n&gt; would make my day.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; btw: I&#39;=\r\nve hit a dead end with my brute &quot;static&quot; by host name resource\n&gt; mappings .=\r\n..

I&#39;m lazy and\nI have n=\r\no time to study the whole codebase.\n\n\nNikola\n\n\n\n"}}
