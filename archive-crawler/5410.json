Can you describe some ways in which it might be helpful?\n\nThe situation I&#39;ve seen is where a JS/AJAXy application uses the \n&#39;#fragment&#39; to affect the rendering or behavior of the page. For \nexample, I&#39;ve seen it used analogously to a client-side query-string:\n\nhttp://example.com/app#redirectTo=/help\n\nJavascript in such a page might load different URIs, construct different \noutlinks, or do an immediate redirect to a different URI depending on \nthe &#39;#fragment&#39;. Theoretically (but not yet), Heritrix could find those \nlinks if it preserved the &#39;#fragment&#39;. (It also might need to \nre-extract, though not necessarily re-fetch, that same URI when it is \nencountered with a different &#39;#fragment&#39; later.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
