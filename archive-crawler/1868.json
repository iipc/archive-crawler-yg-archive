So far I&#39;ve discovered 9,870,579\ndocuments and crawled 3,326,501. This consumes approximately 17 GB on\ndisk for the ARC files, and 34 GB on disk for the BDB state. It looks,\nfrom the ad hoc monitoring that I&#39;ve been doing on disk usage, that\nthere is a roughly linear 2:1 ratio in state storage to ARC\nstorage. Does anyone have a feel if this is the expected ration? We\nwill be done many more larger crawls than this, and need to budget\ndisk space appropriately. (Note that I&#39;m only crawling storing\ntext/html, so I get good compression in the arcs (so far around 4:1).\n\nAlso, while I have configured a maximum of 100 toe threads, at this\npoint only 92 are active (i.e., the dashboard states &quot;91 of\n92&quot;). About 10% of the seeds haven&#39;t even been processed yet: I take\nit this doesn&#39;t happen until the other queues have been completely\nexhausted?\n\nThe threads report states that there are 92 in the pool, but lists\nstatus for 100. How can I find the 8 that aren&#39;t being used?\n\nTIA,\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
