I have been attempting to crawl auto forums and gather all\n&gt; posts in the forum. For example I want to capture all posts in all\n&gt; the forums at [URL]. I don&#39;t want my crawl to\n&gt; branch out to other URIs but I do want it to dive down into the forum\n&gt; itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; My problem is that when I try to limit the crawl from wandering to\n&gt; other sites I seem to limit the dive down into the forum itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does anyone have any suggestion on how to configure a crawl so that\n&gt; it will focus on the seed ([URL]) and all the\n&gt; pages below the seed? So far I have played with the max-hops settings\n&gt; without much luck.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your patience.  I have been studying the user manual and\n&gt; reading the posts in this group but still find the configuration\n&gt; settings somewhat confusing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
