I checked out HEAD via sourceforge\n&gt; cvs and I added two more class for scope as suggested.  I am also\n&gt; using Eclipse, so I did the test run on Eclipse and it works great.\n\nGood.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; One thought on DomainScope, if my seed url is dept1.siteA.com,\n&gt; DomainScope won&#39;t take dept2.siteA.com as in scope, but it does if my\n&gt; seed url is www.siteA.com becasuse we strip www[0-9] from the url.  I\n&gt; still couldn&#39;t decide whether it is what I want or not, I am sure it\n&gt; is not hard to do that change.  I just thought it is worth mentioning.\n\nYeah. www gets treated differently from other subdomains being sorta \nequated to the domain that results from stripping of www.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I saw the Lowercase URL rule, it seems simple enough to modify.  I&#39;ll\n&gt; sure post on the mailing list if I ever changed it. \n\nGrand.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Okie, question move to next step.  How do I deploy my changes ?  I\n&gt; tried to run maven build as in the developer&#39;s manual.  Build run but\n&gt; it failed on several Test.  And there are no files in\n&gt; target/distribution folder I am assuming because of test failed ? Oh,\n&gt; I am running this on windows machine because of my IDE, my production\n&gt; run will be on Linux though.  I try to build the jar file from the\n&gt; class folder and it runs but several errors in web browser since my\n&gt; war file is from 1.2\n&gt;\nCheckout http://crawler.archive.org/faq.html#testsfail. Build on the \nproduction machine if you can (Its hard to support you on windows -- I \ndon&#39;t have one to hand).\n\n&gt; One issue I notice while I am running under Eclipse, the link to\n&gt; /jobs/pending.jsp and completed.jsp are broken, I am getting 404.  I\n&gt; am not sure is it because I am under development run under eclipse ?\n&gt;\nFixed yesterday (Thanks for pointing it out).\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Okie, it is getting a bit long.  Thanks for your time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Laters,\n&gt; Jay\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me add qualification to the above.  I suggested using HEAD because\n&gt; &gt; its stablizing as we ready for 1.4 release, limited testng show no\n&gt; &gt; glaring issues, and we ourselves have been using recent versions of\n&gt; &gt; HEAD doing large crawls (HEAD also has loads of fixes, new features,\n&gt; &gt; and lasts much longer before OOME&#39;ing).  That said, for &#39;production\n&gt; &gt; purposes&#39;, you should always use released versions of Heritrix (For\n&gt; &gt; what you&#39;re trying to do, there is no change in canonicalization rules\n&gt; &gt; API so it should be easy bringing forward 1.2 rules).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
