As described in the message referenced above, a crawl \nstarts out making sort of OK utilization (3 Mbps per crawling machine) \nbut then gradually drops down to only a few kilobits/second. We tried \ntweaking the &quot;politeness&quot; settings in Heritrix, but that still did not \nhelp keep utilization from dropping to the kilobit/second scale. We have \nbeen experimenting with seed lists with as many as 10,000 and even \n100,000 entries per list. I am attaching a copy of the H1 order.xml we \ntypically use.\n\nAny suggestions on how to get Heritrix to maintain better bandwidth \nutilization are appreciated.\n\n-- \nYoussef Eldakar\nBibliotheca Alexandrina\n\n\r\n--------------030704010406080808030209\r\nContent-Type: text/xml; name=&quot;order.xml&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;order.xml&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------030704010406080808030209--\r\n\n"}}
