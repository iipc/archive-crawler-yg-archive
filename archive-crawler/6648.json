I still don&#39;t understand how to download more than a website at the s=\r\name time. Is it I just type in all the url addresses in the seeds textbox, =\r\nline by line then add in once again all the url addresss in the http-header=\r\n-user agent text box by adding &quot;+&quot; sign. \nFor example:\nseeds text box:\nhttp=\r\n://www.abc.com\nhttp://www.def.com\n\nhttp-header-user agent text box:\nMozilla=\r\n/5.0 (compatible; heritrix/1.14.3 +http://www.abc.com +http://www.def.com)\n=\r\n\n4.Why is it after we key in the url in the seed box then we need to re-key=\r\nin the url once agin into the http-header-user agent text box  and somemore=\r\n we need to provide our email add in the &quot;from&quot; texbox? It seems like doing=\r\n double work. Can we simplify this? Is there any easier way on this? \n\n5.I =\r\nfacing the remote access problem.
