This crawl is still running,\nhaving retrieved about 19,000 documents and counting. \n\nIt seems to be going slower than would have been expected,\nalthough it is clearly politeness, not CPU, bound. The\ncause might be that it was running concurrently on crawl09\nwith the other crawl (see below). \n\nHow many did HTTrack and Mercator get, again? If we&#39;re already\npast their yields, we could stop the crawler and begin analysis;\nif not, we could give Heritrix a bit more time; it still has \na backlog of ~10,000 URIs and seems to have discovered about 5,000\nmore in its last 1,000 visited.\n\nThe data is collecting in crawl09:/0/crawls/test-gojomo/loc-crawl\n\n--\nThe second was of the 9hosts. It seems to have had its work queues\nquickly dominated by junk URIs -- some combo of a weakness in\nthe new extraction and endlessly-deep server error pages. So,\nover 115,000 URIs retrieved, over 80,000 were 4xx errors of\nvarious sorts. From its last status dump to stdout:\n\nStatus Code Distribution:\n        301     33\n        200     23337\n        403     53642\n        204     1\n        500     289\n        414     12781\n        303     1\n        404     21388\n        400     102\n        300     1\n        1       580\n        302     1557\n\nI&#39;ve stopped it, I&#39;m going to see if I can discover what caused it to\ngo awry, and rerun it when possible. It would help to have another set\nof eyes on the problems -- esp. the strange &quot;.replace(/)&quot; URIs affecting\nmultiple hosts -- so please take a look at the output to see if you\ncan figure out when/why things went wrong. The data is at:\n\n  crawl09:/0/crawls/test-gojomo/heri9host/\n\nI can be reached by mail or YM while online here.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
