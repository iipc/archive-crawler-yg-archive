It&#39;s occasionally been discussed; see:\n\n  https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1055\n\nAn open issue, and one for which different operators might have \ndifferent needs, is how to define where a certain URI goes when it is \nreferenced from multiple seeds, or when the path-of-earliest-discovery \nassociates it with one seed, when other heuristics (actual hostname, or \nhops-depth-from-seed) would more closely associate it with another \nseed/site.\n\nOne approach might be to name all W/ARCs by hostname, or by &#39;public \nsuffix&#39; (registered-domain-name-shared-by-many-subdomains), but this \ncould lead to a lot of small &#39;runt&#39; W/ARCs for domains that just \ncontribute a few offsite referenced resources to other sites.\n\nI&#39;m sure we&#39;re someday get around to implementing something here but \nit&#39;s not imminent/scheduled, so other suggestions (or contributions of \nfunctionality) would be appreciated.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 4/1/11 5:20 AM, heritrixquestions wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; what is the best way to do this:\n&gt;\n&gt; * I want to crawl several hundreds of websites (for text mining purposes, but also the images etc. for display)\n&gt; * I want to keep the crawled data separate per site\n&gt; * I want it to be fast (obviously)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m new to heritrix. I started using 1.14.4. and used most of the defaults, except for restricting it to stay on the sites that are the seeds.\n&gt;\n&gt; This works fine already, but with the default ARC output, all pages, images, etc. from all the seeds of one job are mixed together in the ARC files.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I use only one seed per job, I get the files the way I want them, but it is much, much slower, because obviously the crawling politeness causes many pauses when there is only one host.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I improve this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; M.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
