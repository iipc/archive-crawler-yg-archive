Now the Heritrix works fine (I&#39;ve adde=\r\nd  \nPrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule).  \n  \nAs I understand, if I want to proce=\r\nss not only html files (and also  \njsp, php, etc.), I should set such regul=\r\nar expression:  \n  \n^(?i)^.*&#92;.(?:html?|?:jsp?|?:php?|doc|ppt)$ ,  \n  \nand i=\r\nf there are URLs like &quot;http://some.domain.com/page.jsp?id=3D3&quot; or  \n&quot;http:/=\r\n/some.domain.org/page.php?id=3D10&quot;, to process such URL&#39;s I  \nshould set su=\r\nch regular expression:  \n  \n^(?i)^.*&#92;.(?:html?|?:jsp?.*|?:php?.*|doc|ppt)$ =\r\n.  \n  \nThe last two questions I have are:  \n1) What the regular expression =\r\n(?:html?) does mean?  \n(html?) means that html can appear once or not at al=\r\nl,  \nand (?:html) means that html, as a non-capturing group (what does it  =\r\n\nmean)?  \n  \n2) Is it possible to use seeds in old manner in this case (I m=\r\nean  \nhttp://yahoo.com instead of http://yahoo.com/index.html)? \nIt&#39;s possi=\r\nble that I don&#39;t know beforehand the start page of the \nsite (index.html, i=\r\nndex.php, or something else). \n \nThanks a lot again. \n  \nRegards,  \nArtem. =\r\n \n   \n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@...&gt;   \n=\r\nwrote:   \n&gt;   \n&gt; Hi Artem,   \n&gt;    \n&gt; If your seeds don&#39;t end with html?|do=\r\nc|ppt|swf then you will get   \n-5000.   \n&gt; But I believe that the rule sequ=\r\nence will do what you want --   \n&gt; everything from certain domain(s) ending=\r\n with specified file   \nextensions.   \n&gt;    \n&gt; Try adding index.html to you=\r\nr seeds. For example:    \n&gt; http://yahoo.com/index.html instead of http://y=\r\nahoo.com/   \n&gt;    \n&gt; Also, it seems that you are missing PrerequisiteAccept=\r\nDecideRule.   \nYou    \n&gt; should probably add this rule as the last rule in =\r\nthe sequence.   \n&gt; This will allow fetching of mandatory prerequisites (dns=\r\n and   \nrobots.txt).   \n&gt;    \n&gt; Take care,   \n&gt; i.   \n\n\n"}}
