Do you have a copy of that page?\n&gt;\n&gt; Unfortunately no.  Did you see this mail sent yesterday?\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1598.\nYes, i did, some hours after writing my mail. I&#39;m gonna try it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   You also mentioned to add some filters in HTTP-Fetcher and\n&gt; ARCWriter processors. How can I read the http header and/or the\n&gt; content in the\n&gt;&gt; ARCWriterProcessor?\n&gt;\n&gt; Are you trying to exclude certain mimetypes from being fetched and\n&gt; from being written to disk or are you trying to do something else.  If\n&gt; the former, see the email cited above.\nI try the former one, however, the following explanation seems to\nbe useful for our further work. Thanks.\n&gt;  Else, to get at headers, you\n&gt; need to go via the CrawlURI:\n&gt;\n&gt; ((HttpMethod)curi.getObject(A_HTTP_TRANSACTION)).getResponseHeader(HEADER_NAME);\n&gt;\n&gt; ... where curi is the instance of CrawlURI, A_HTTP_TRANSACTION is a\n&gt; define found in org.archive.crawler.datamodel.CoreAttributeConstants\n&gt; and where HEADER_NAME is name of header you are interested in: e.g.\n&gt; &quot;Server&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; To get at the content, again, you&#39;d go via the CrawlURI:\n&gt;\n&gt; curi.getHttpRecorder().getRecordedInput().getReplayInputStream()\n&gt;\n&gt; St.Ack\nTamas\n\n"}}
