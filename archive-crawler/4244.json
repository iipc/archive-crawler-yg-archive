Will it be OK if the references to the CrawlURIs are\n&gt; released and available for GC eventually?  (e.g., store the CrawlURIs\n&gt; in a set for processing after crawl completion, after which the set is\n&gt; emptied, freeing up all references to the CrawlURIs)\n\nThe comment may be a little strong, but the problem is that once \nthe CrawlURI completes its processing cycle, almost all its \ninteresting state is discarded. (See CrawlURI.stripToMinimal() and \nCrawlURI.processingCleanup().)\n\nSo especially if you were hoping to do any additional analysis in \nanother thread, the info could be yanked out from under you.\n\nI suggest you copy what you need at the moment the CrawlURI is \npassed with the notification, or otherwise ensure you are not \nconsulting the CrawlURI instance after its processing cycle has \nfinished.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
