Doesn&#39;t look like the best option because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it seems that is it t=\r\nied closely to their text searching software.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     * Heritrix: Also sc=\r\nales. This one currently looks like the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; option.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     * Scra=\r\npy: Has not been used on a large scale (not sure though). I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dont know=\r\n if it has the basic stuff like URL canonicalization. I would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like to=\r\n use this one because it is a python framework (I like python\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more th=\r\nan java), but I don&#39;t know if they have implemented the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advanced feat=\r\nures of a web crawler.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Summary:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We need to get as=\r\n many images as possible from the web. Which existing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crawling framew=\r\nork is both scalable and efficient , but also the one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which will be t=\r\nhe easiest to modify to get only images?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!
