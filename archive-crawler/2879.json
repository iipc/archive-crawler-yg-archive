Can somebody there describe what sorts of changes \n&gt; were made to 1.8 to address the two problems above, and what the new \n&gt; limits are?\n\nI echo what Stack said: the 1.6 and 1.8 releases both have improvements \nin memory behavior, compared to a 1.5.x from-CVS version.\n\nThe UI limit preventing the editting of large seed lists hasn&#39;t changed \nrecently. You should, however, be able to edit the seeds file on disk, \nand then upon changing any other setting, the list will be reprocessed \n(as long as the scope&#39;s &#39;reread-seeds-on-config&#39; setting is the default \n&#39;true&#39;).\n\nA better system for handling large numbers of seeds -- both in the UI \nand behind-the-scenes -- is a priority for the next release.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
