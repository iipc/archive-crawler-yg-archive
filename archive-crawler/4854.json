If the container doesn&#39;t respond,\nyou&#39;ll h=\r\nave to kill it.\nI would say that you should try shutting down, then if an e=\r\nxception is\nthrown (I guess you could see if anything was written to the er=\r\nror\nstream) you can kill it.  This is where I like using something like\nGro=\r\novy or Beanshell to create a script that can call that jar file for\nyou and=\r\n actually catch exceptions thrown. So, if you can&#39;t connect via\nJMX, or the=\r\n call throws an exception, you could catch it and call your\nbash kill scrip=\r\nt.\n\n\nOn Dec 18, 2007 12:51 PM, Mathew Nik Foscarini &lt;nfoscarini@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nice, thank you for sharing this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Will this force =\r\nthe shutdown if Heritrix becomes unresponsive. Maybe a Bash\n&gt; script that w=\r\naits X seconds for the process to terminate, and if it doesn&#39;t\n&gt; to then ki=\r\nll it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think I have a sample Bash script somewhere that does this on =\r\nanother\n&gt; server I work with.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Briggs &lt;acidbriggs@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; So, I looked at how I would shutdown my instance via the command line,\n=\r\n&gt;  it would go like this:\n&gt;\n&gt;  java -jar cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar contr=\r\nolRole:admin\n&gt;  localhost:8849\n&gt; org.archive.crawler:jmxport=3D8849,name=3D=\r\nHeritrix,type=3DCrawlService,guiport=3D8080,host=3Ddev-odc-006\n&gt;  shutdown\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  so you need modify that to work for you:\n&gt;\n&gt;  java -jar cmdline-jmxcli=\r\nent-0.10.5.jar controlRole:&lt;your_password&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;your_machine&gt;:&lt;your_port&gt; &lt;y=\r\nour_heritrix_mbean&gt; shutdown\n&gt;\n&gt;  On Dec 18, 2007 12:28 PM, Briggs &lt;acidbri=\r\nggs@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; The only way i know of doing it is using the MBe=\r\nans that get deployed.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; You can use the cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.j=\r\nar int the bin directory of\n&gt;  &gt; heritrix to call these beans.
