I just added a note to the developer manual that talks of the \n&gt; particular way in which gzip; A gzip member per arc record rather than \n&gt; one gzip member to hold the total arc.\n\nThat would be nice.\n\n&gt; Its possible to disable heritrix&#39;s writing of compressed arcs via \n&gt; configuration, if its local policy to collect in uncompressed mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; On &quot;in-format compression ... confuse people&quot;, I&#39;m with the Tom Emerson \n&gt; comment that its not zlib thats at fault.\n\nI&#39;m not saying that zlib is any worse or better than other compression\nalgorithms in comprehensibility.  It&#39;s that if you just get the file,\nit&#39;s binary junk, not the immediately comprehensible ASCII-based ARC\nformat that had me convinced would be readable 100 years from now.\n\nOne could argue that the same holds for hardware or file system\ncompression, but I would say that in those cases, if you can read the\nfiles, you get it out of compressed mode.  Only if a tape/disk was found\nso long from now that none of the original hardware is available and\nsome kind of other scan is set up would the compression be a problem.\n\nOne way to make compression a little more workable would be to not\ncompress the meatdata lines.  That way, there wouldn&#39;t be any confusion\nabout the length of the block, and it would be possible to understand\nthe structure of the file without using zlib.  It could (and should) be\nindicated in the header what compression style is used.  \n\n-Lars\n\n\n"}}
