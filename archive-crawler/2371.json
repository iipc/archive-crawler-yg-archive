Did you just drop in a JAR \n&gt; file and edit the configuration manually? Unfortunately that doesn&#39;t \n&gt; work. Assuming you are using the BdbFrontier, you&#39;ll need to edit \n&gt; org.archive.crawler.frontier.AbstractFrontier where you need to add \n&gt; your class name to the String &#39;queueStr&#39; on line 260 (latest HEAD). \n&gt; Obviously it would be better if Heritrix read this value from a \n&gt; configuration file, but it doesn&#39;t so I&#39;m afraid you will have to do \n&gt; your edit and remake Heritrix. Perhaps better, you could rewrite the \n&gt; class to read this from file and submit a patch.\n\nHeyup Kris.  You might be a little bit off the mark in the above.  Line \n260 is giving you a chance to set config. via a properties file -- if in \nan obtuse way.  Line 260 is looking at system properties and only if \nnought found, does it use the provided list: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/frontier/AbstractFrontier.html#260.  \nSystem properties get populated from heritrix.properties by \nHeritrix#loadProperties:  See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#752.  \nAny properties that have a key that starts with &#39;org.archive.crawler&#39; \nare added into system properties.  We find heritrix.properties by first \nlooking to see if user has pointed us at alternate properties by passing \na &#39;-Dheritrix.properties=ALTERNATE&#39; on command line using that if \nfound.  Otherwise, we look to see if a conf dir in HERITRIX_HOME and if \nthat contains a heritrix.properties.   Fallback is the \nheritrix.properties that gets built into the heritrix.jar (See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#774).\n\n\nS�ren wrote:\n\n&gt;     It is not clear to me, if the heritrix.properties is read anywhere\n&gt;     implicitly in our (as we don&#39;t use the Heritrix.java class, but\n&gt;     instead instantiate a CrawlController, and use this to crawl).\n&gt;     The Heritrix.java class seems to me the only class, which loads the\n&gt;     heritrix.properties.\n&gt;\nCan you just call Heritrix#loadProperties before you instantiate your \nCrawlController soon after startup?  Its static.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
