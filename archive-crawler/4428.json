Is there a way to determine this location?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\nAre you asking if you can insert a processor into the crawler at the \n&#39;postprocessor&#39; stage to insert the ARC file name a particular download \nwas written to out to a remote database?  If so, the answer is no.  The \nnecessary information is not available at the postprocessor stage, not \nwithout changing the ARCWriter so it adds the name of the current ARC \nfile to the CrawlURI object so this is info is available later in the \nprocessing chain.\n\nOr are you asking about post-processing ARCs after a crawl is done to \nload a database table with a key of URI and a value of the name of the \nARC file that URI was written too?  If you are asking the latter, this \nis fairly straight-forward.  You would write a program that would read \nall ARCs made by a crawl.  Foreach, you would iterate over its contents \nand per URI, you would write out to the database your findings.  See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual/arcs.html for more \non ARCs, their format and available readers.\n\n&gt; I also don&#39;t know much about the ARCs. Do they contain an entire\n&gt; site, or just one page and all it&#39;s associated files (images, etc).\n&gt; If it can have multiple pages in it, it might change what I&#39;m doing.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDefault configuration writes downloads randomly to one of a small set of \nopen ARC files. \n\nBest way to answer the above question on whats in an ARC, if the above \ncited link does not answer your question, is to crawl and then look at \ntheir contents.\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me know if anyone can help!
