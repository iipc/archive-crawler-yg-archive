I&#39;m still working with heritrix-1.14.1. I&#39;m already ALMOST\n&gt;&gt; up to beginner status! At this time, I&#39;m having problems when a\n&gt;&gt; crawl job hits its max-document-download limit. Given a reasonably\n&gt;&gt; hefty download limit, heritrix generates several arc.gz files - but\n&gt;&gt; the process usually leaves one final arc.gz.open file. For me, this\n&gt;&gt; has prevented recovery of the last .arc file for processing by\n&gt;&gt; bin/arcreader, which demands its input in a .arc file. Does anybody\n&gt;&gt; know if its possible to persuade heritrix to close a still-open\n&gt;&gt; archive file on exit? Does anybody know how?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Any suggestions would be welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Heritrix should close all open arc files on exit but often doesnâ€™t,\n&gt; for some reason. In any case it is generally safe, in my experience,\n&gt; to simply rename the files to .arc.gz, the worst problem you are\n&gt; liable to encounter is some trailing garbage.\n&gt; \n&gt; best,\n&gt; Erik Hetzner\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n&gt; ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\n"}}
