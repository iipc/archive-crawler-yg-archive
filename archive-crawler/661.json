Solaris doesn&#39;t come with it,\n&gt; for instance (and BTW, I prefer zless:).\n\nYes, of course you need to have z(more|less)... Linux, FreeBSD, and\nMac OS X all come with it. \n\n&gt; But if you read RFC 1952 (the gzip standard), you&#39;ll notice that &quot;The\n&gt; data format defined by this specification does not attempt to provide\n&gt; random access to compressed data...&quot;, which is essentially what we&#39;re\n&gt; trying to make it do.  That some tools work with that is just luck, some\n&gt; tools won&#39;t.  In fact, .arc.gz files are not gzip files according to the\n&gt; standard, but a concatenation of multiple gzip files (not zlib streams).\n\nYou are right, of course. The use of multiple gzip files concatenated\ntogether is a clever way of getting around the random access limitation.\n\n&gt; What you can&#39;t do right now is skip past blocks without decompressing\n&gt; them, as you don&#39;t know their compressed lengths.  That means that\n&gt; extracting CDX files is more time-consuming, as you&#39;ll have to read and\n&gt; uncompress about 100 times as much material.  \n\nTrue. The way I handle this in libarc is that I inflate and examine\nenough of the record to extract the URL header, and from there I just\ninflate the rest of the gzip entry without investigating the bytes. It\nis time consuming, but it works. To test this, I just instrumented my\narcdump utility to report the time spent building its internal index:\non an 100MB gziped ARC file containing 11,941 entries it took 2.8\nseconds on my 1.8 GHz G5. Assuming that you spend those 2.8 seconds\nonce to generate a CDX file, it isn&#39;t horrible, I suppose.\n\n&gt; Of course, the proposed idea of having the metadata\n\nThe more I thought about your idea on my drive into the office this\nmorning, the more I like it. Keep the URL record uncompressed, and\ninclude a compression method and offset to the start of the next\nentry.\n\n&gt; That would violate one of the requirements set forth in\n&gt; http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php:\n[...]\n\nNoted.\n\n&gt; To understand a gzipped ARC file, you either have to have an index or\n&gt; you must parse and uncompress it from the beginning.  There&#39;s no going\n&gt; into the middle of it and finding the headers.  While it&#39;s not the\n&gt; integrity of the file that is destroyed, it does make index-less work on\n&gt; the file a lot harder.\n\nYou can&#39;t go into the middle of an uncompressed ARC file and easily\nfind the headers either.\n\nIt also depends on the tools. With libarc working with index-less\nfiles is trivial.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
