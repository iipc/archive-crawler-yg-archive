But I have two limitations:\n&gt; 1 - I can not pause jobs a=\r\nnd then resume it with\n&gt; cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar (that I used to pause=\r\n the job in hours of\n&gt; peak traffic and resume the job after)\n&gt; 2 - Not onl=\r\ny would like to pause the jobs but will also begin where\n&gt; they stayed, usi=\r\nng cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar in a automatically and\n&gt; planned time.\n&gt; Th=\r\nese two requirements are essential for making crawler automatically\n&gt; with =\r\nthe HERITRIX, and to automate the use of HERITRIX running on\n&gt; several mach=\r\nines when is used in a distributed manner using HERITRIX\n&gt; Cluster Controll=\r\ner.\n&gt; It is not difficult add the functionality 1 and 2 in the\n&gt; cmdline-jm=\r\nxclient-0.10.5.jar but I didn&#39;t found on the site of\n&gt; HERITRIX the source =\r\ncode of it. While steps 1 and 2 can be automated \n&gt; by making a post reques=\r\nt to WUI (here are also needed to send the\n&gt; credentials in the post-petiti=\r\non), is more comfortable do that with\n&gt; the cmdline-jmxclient.\n&gt; I have run=\r\nning Heritrix-1.12.1 in Windows 2003 Server.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
