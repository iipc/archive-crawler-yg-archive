I&#39;m using regula=\r\nr\n&gt; expression rules based on suggestions from previous posting. I would\n&gt; =\r\nlike to filter out everything except for text/xml and application/xml\n&gt; fil=\r\nes. The filters are applied on the scope, midfetch, and the arc\n&gt; writer pr=\r\nocessor. \n&gt; So far everything works ok, except it still dowloads some text/=\r\nhtml\n&gt; files even though html is part of the rejection regexp in the scope.=\r\n\n&gt; Turns out all of the text/html downloads are dynamic URLs like this, \n&gt; =\r\nhttp://somewebpage/subdir/?C=3DD;O=3DA \n&gt; My question then is how do I prev=\r\nent these text/html from being\n&gt; written into the arc file. Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Sh=\r\nawn\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
