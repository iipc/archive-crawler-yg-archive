You&#39;ll have to \nwrite your own processor to parse out text to run your word-check against.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Can Heritrix do this out-of-the-box? (seems like it should).\n&gt;\n&gt; But when I try to set a pre-processor URIregexp filter to return\n&gt; &quot;false&quot; for the pattern &quot;jpg&quot; I still get files whose URI matches &quot;jpg&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; What am I doing wrong, please?  Also, suggestions on setting a filter\n&gt; to look for the listed words appreciated.\n&gt;\nYou&#39;re probably doing nothing wrong.  Our filters as-is are \nself-admitted non intuitive (See &#39;6.1.1.1. Problems with the current \nScopes&#39; of the user manual).  A new filter model was recently added.  If \nthe Tom Emerson blog entry doesn&#39;t get you what you need, I&#39;d suggest \nyou try the new (experimental) DecidingScope and DecidingFilters (See \ndecidingscope in the user manual to get started).\n\n&gt; Great project, this Heritrix, BTW!\n\nThank you for the kind words,\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; John\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
