See CrawlURI.addAnnotation().\n\nBut, this mechanism isn&#39;t very robust and if heavily used by different \nprojects could run into problems.\n\nI&#39;ve been wondering if we need a more general add-what-you-need option \nfor the crawl.log; perhaps the last item on each line could be an \narbitrarily-extendible JSON string -- either with no newlines or with \nsome newline-escaping/continuation convention? (Or is there a better \npractice we could borrow from another project?)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 5/11/10 1:23 AM, Coram, Roger wrote:\n&gt; Is there a simple way to get additional data logged in the crawl.log?\n&gt; Specifically, I was hoping to get the IP address suffixed to the\n&gt; existing data.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Roger G.
