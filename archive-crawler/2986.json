Seems like this report would be equally\n&gt;  &gt; useful post-crawl.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the reports are written to files at the end of a crawl. In particular,\n&gt; the mime type info is written to &quot;mimetype-report.txt&quot;. So all that info\n&gt; is preserved after the end of a crawl even though it isn&#39;t accessible via\n&gt; the web UI.\n\nJust to verify, there is currently no way to view a Crawl Report once a \njob has completed, right?\n\nI am thinking of making a small enhancement that would allow a crawl \nreport to be produced for any completed job.  Clicking on any of the \nhosts at the bottom of the report would display the crawl log for that \nhost as it does now, but each URL would be turned into a hyperlink, and \nclicking on the link would load the resource into the browser.  This \nwould be useful for browsing the crawled collection.\n\nIf someone is already aware of existing software that does this, please \nlet me know so I don&#39;t re-invent the wheel.  ;)\n\nFrank\n\n"}}
