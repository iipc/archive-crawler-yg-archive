Any help would be greatly appreciated.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIt can&#39;t be done without doing a bit of coding to replace the current \nARCWriterProcessor with one that just drops request/response on disk \nperhaps mirroring the directory layout of the  website being crawled \ntaking care to create new local directories if a folder has a million \nfiles in it.  While such a writer would be an I/O killer, it might make \nHeritrix more accessible; especially for those doing small crawls \n(There&#39;s a related RFE.
