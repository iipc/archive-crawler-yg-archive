If so, be aware most search engines ban \nrobots from their results pages.\n\nIn your private mail, you included a &#39;scope&#39; configuration which only \nhad one DecideRule, to accept URIs of your patterns. Working scopes have \nmany rules, including some to support the fetching of prerequisite URIs. \nAs you forwarded your scope, it would not accept a seed URI (such as a \nsearch engine results page) that did not fit the pattern, nor allow \ncertain preqrequisite fetches to complete.\n\nI always recommend starting with a default, working scope, then \nincrementally changing it to match your needs -- leaving most of it \nunchanged.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nramchandra_narkhede wrote:\n&gt; Hi Gordon,\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all thanks for the reply. Yes I&#39;m using Heritrix 1.14 and I\n&gt; was referring the same documentation you have suggested.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to configure the crawl for site http://www.salvo.co.in/,\n&gt; on this sites I am interested in the results and the pages \n&gt; &quot;Results 1 - 100 of 7652 items found : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n&gt; 14 15 . . . | Next&quot; to get more results. \n&gt; \n&gt; To do so, i was writing two rules. i.e. the url should match\n&gt; &quot;http:&#92;&#92;/&#92;&#92;/www&#92;&#92;.salvo&#92;&#92;.co&#92;&#92;.uk&#92;&#92;/forsale&quot; and &quot;-x&#92;&#92;d+x&#92;&#92;d+&#92;&#92;.html&quot;.\n&gt; Are these rules correct?.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt; Ram.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
