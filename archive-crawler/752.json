I&#39;ve never seen a higher number than &quot;4 of 50&quot; in the\n&gt; &gt; active threads value on the console page.  Am I not understanding\n&gt; &gt; something, or do I maybe have something set incorrectly?  I guess I\n&gt; &gt; was expecting that  I&#39;d see more active threads (21? since there were\n&gt; &gt; 21 hosts being crawled?)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Rob.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
