We run \nheritrix in an integrated software solution.  So its run via API \nwith a command line like interface.  \nWhen upgrading to 1.4 Heritrix added this \nThreadLocalHttpConnectionManager.  It stays running and keeps the \nwhole application up, whereas the application stopped when the crawl \nwas completed in the previous version.  \nSetting a daemon thread solves the problem and doesn&#39;t seem to have \nany consequences.  I suggest a bug fix in which this is set to be a \ndaemon thread.  Thanks.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; jirleech wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are in the process of upgrading to Heritrix 1.4 and we&#39;ve \nnoticed\n&gt; &gt; that when when the crawl completes and the logging status says\n&gt; &gt; complete, the app never seems to exit or shutdown.
