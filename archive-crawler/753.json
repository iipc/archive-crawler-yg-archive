I&#39;ve never seen a higher number than &quot;4 of 50&quot; in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;active threads value on the console page.  Am I not understanding\n&gt;&gt;&gt;something, or do I maybe have something set incorrectly?  I guess I\n&gt;&gt;&gt;was expecting that  I&#39;d see more active threads (21? since there were\n&gt;&gt;&gt;21 hosts being crawled?)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Rob.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
