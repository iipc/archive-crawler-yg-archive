The Spring-originated XML configuration \nmetadata format is now our format for describing crawls, as well.\n\nThe web-based user-interface in Heritrix 3 has been streamlined and \nupdated to have consistent URLs and simple forms for most actions, \nincluding viewing and editing job files or running arbitrary script code \nwithin the context of a job. Programmatic operations against the web \ninterface have replaced JMX as the preferred manner to remote-control \nHeritrix.\n\nAlso, Heritrix 3 moves to a model where a single job, in a single job \ndirectory, may be be relaunched in place many times (instead of creating \na new job directory before each launch).\n\nAs a prerelease test version, there are still known gaps in \nfunctionality, interface, and documentation; we&#39;re working towards a \nofficial 3.0 release in July. The current prioritized roster of issues \nto be addressed is viewable in the project issue tracker.\n\nDistribution packages (.tar.gz or .zip) may be downloaded directly from \nour Maven2 repository:\n\nhttp://builds.archive.org:8080/maven2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/3.0.0-alpha/\n\nAs always, problem reports, ideas, fix/feature contributions, and other \nfeedback are all welcome here on the list and on the project wiki and \nJIRA issue tracker:\n\nHeritrix Wiki: http://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix\nHeritrix JIRA: http://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER\n\nThanks!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
