I have a crawl going that was started from 40 seeds using \nthe HostScope. I left the defaults of max-link-hops set to 25, \nmax-trans-hops set to 5 and max-path-depth set to 20. I configured it to \nlog any URIs that it considers out of scope. I can see in the \nheritrix_out.log file that there are thousands of URIs that it is not \ncrawling because they are outOfScope. But in the crawl job report I can see \nthat is still crawling many hosts and retrieving files successfully from \nhosts that are not the same as the hosts in the seed list. Is this normal \nfor the HostScope? Ideally I would like to be able to only retrieve files \nfrom the hosts in the seed list or maybe go one link &#39;out&#39; past the host.\n\nBTW I&#39;m using heritrix 1.6.\n\nthanks,\nAndrea\n\n\n\n"}}
