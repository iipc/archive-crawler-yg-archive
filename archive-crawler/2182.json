We want to be able to visualise the result of =\r\nthe two crawls, so we can spot the material that HTTrack is missing (on som=\r\ne sites there is a lot of it).\n\nOur preference is to do this in an HTTrack-=\r\nlike format.  For those of you who haven&#39;t used HTTrack, it is not designed=\r\n for archiving; it is designed as an offline Web site reader.  This means i=\r\nt downloads files from a site(s), and creates a directory tree that loosely=\r\n replicates the site as static HTML.  All HTML inks are converted to relati=\r\nve links so that the directory tree can be browsed with a web browser and w=\r\nill appear similar to the original site.\n\nIt should be fairly straightforwa=\r\nrd to write a program that reads a set of ARC files, grabs the HTML Pages, =\r\ntweaks the links, writes them to an HTTrack-like browsable directory tree. =\r\nDoes anyone know if such a program already exists?\n\nFinally, can anyone rec=\r\nommend any tools for browsing or visualising the content of the set of ARC =\r\nfiles generated from a single crawl.\n\nThanks,\nGordon\n\n\n"}}
