Comment lines begin with &#39;#&#39;.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; When I view the settings after setting some seeds, however, it says,\n&gt; &quot;Seed list too large to edit&quot; under seeds, with the words &quot;seed list&quot;\n&gt; linking to what I put in the seeds box.  This happens even if we only\n&gt; list one seed.  What is going on?\n\nMay I have your seed list to try on this end (You can send via private \nmail: stack at archive dot org).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, we&#39;re trying to retrieve files from a secure server (using the\n&gt; Rfc2617 credentials).  When the credentials are wrong, we get a 401\n&gt; error as expected.  However, when the credentials are correct, it\n&gt; hangs while trying to retrieve robots.txt (which is not on the\n&gt; server).  On a non-secure server, things worked fine (it would get a\n&gt; 404 error while trying to retrieve robots.txt, then move on to\n&gt; retrieving the desired files).\n&gt;\nWhat JVM/platform are you on?  Is all of the site protected with \nRFC2617?  If not, can you crawl the unprotected areas?\n\nThe exception below is interesting.  We&#39;ve not seen it before.  We \ninsert our own streams under httpclient and indeed they do not support \nmark/reset.  Its not been a problem up to this.  Perhaps this needs to \nchange.\n\nThanks,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; Here&#39;s the stack trace:\n&gt; java.io.IOException: mark/reset not supported\n&gt;     at java.io.InputStream.reset(InputStream.java:331)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpConnection.isResponseAvailable(HttpConnection.java:876)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager$HttpConnectionAdapter.isResponseAvailable(MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.java:1303)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponseBody(HttpMethodBase.java:1695)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponseBody(HttpMethodBase.java:1638)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.archive.httpclient.HttpRecorderGetMethod.readResponseBody(HttpRecorderGetMethod.java:98)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.archive.crawler.fetcher.FetchHTTP$2.readResponseBody(FetchHTTP.java:294)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.readResponse(HttpMethodBase.java:1601)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.execute(HttpMethodBase.java:999)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.archive.httpclient.HttpRecorderGetMethod.execute(HttpRecorderGetMethod.java:116)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeWithRetry(HttpMethodDirector.java:382)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector.executeMethod(HttpMethodDirector.java:168)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:393)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:324)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.archive.crawler.fetcher.FetchHTTP.innerProcess(FetchHTTP.java:307)\n&gt;     at org.archive.crawler.framework.Processor.process(Processor.java:102)\n&gt;     at \n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.processCrawlUri(ToeThread.java:273)\n&gt;     at org.archive.crawler.framework.ToeThread.run(ToeThread.java:143)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -Samuel Freilich\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
