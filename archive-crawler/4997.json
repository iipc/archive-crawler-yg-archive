I&#39;m guessing that it does, so yes, if heritrix \nmanages to pull down a gigantic HTML document, then HTMLParser could run \nout of memory.  Also, you interact with it via Strings, so if you have a \nstring larger than available memory, you&#39;re still in trouble there.\n\nThere is a chance that it doesn&#39;t load the entire document, since most \nof the interaction is based on visitors that walk the HTML.  I just \nhaven&#39;t used it enough (or looked at the code) so I don&#39;t know.  For \nsafety, it&#39;s best to assume that the entire document is read into a \nString at some point.\n\nGood luck!\nMicah\n\nChristian Krumm wrote:\n&gt; Hi Micah,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll give HTMLParser a try.\n&gt; Do you have encounted any problems on a larger scale crawl useing \n&gt; HTMLParser?\n&gt; HTMLParser reads the whole document into memory for parsing (like \n&gt; Jericho), correct me if I am wrong,\n&gt; so it has an inherent OOME risk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Christian\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Micah Wedemeyer schrieb:\n&gt;&gt; I use HTMLParser ( http://htmlparser.sourceforge.net/ ) for all the HTML \n&gt;&gt; processing I need.  Using that, it should be fairly straightforward to \n&gt;&gt; write a processor that extracts the attributes you require.  There may \n&gt;&gt; be built-in heritrix code to help with that sort of stuff, but I never \n&gt;&gt; really looked all that close.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Micah\n\n"}}
