I expect that you will probably find that late in the crawl \n&gt; th=\r\nere are relatively few active queues -- All the hosts which had \n&gt; relative=\r\nly few URIs to crawl were exhausted earlier in the crawl -- now \n&gt; you&#39;re s=\r\neeing the small number of hosts which have a large number of \n&gt; documents.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; (In some cases, this could be crawler traps, such as hosts which \n&gt; ge=\r\nnerate an infinite number of URLs, either through session ID \n&gt; parameters =\r\nor other dynamically generated content, such as calendars.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nvretr wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; hi,all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During the late period of crawl=\r\ning, the crawling data increases\n&gt; &gt; slowly, and the speed is usually lower=\r\n than 5kb/sec, and few of\n&gt; &gt; ToeThread is in active state. What causes thi=\r\ns problem? Is there\n&gt; &gt; something wrong with the software, hardware or craw=\r\nling goals?
