(A \nfailure while writing W/ARCs or &#39;scratch&#39; data *may* be recoverable with \nonly a small amount of lost/corrupt URI data, but any failure writing to \nthe &#39;state&#39; directory will foul the current crawl.)\n\nOur usual practice is to:\n\n(1) export data from the most quickly-filled volumes (targets of W/ARC \ndata) during the crawl, generally as soon as each file is completed\n\n(2) monitor the disk space, and emergency-pause the crawl when space \ngets low\n\nThere is some code in the distribution (LowDiskPauseProcessor in \nH1-3.0.0, DiskSpaceMonitor in TRUNK) to help do part (2) above from \nwithin the crawler process, but our production crawls have used external \nscripts/monitoring instead.\n\nAnother option that you might want to consider if you have full control \nover the machine configuration would be to combine all local disks into \none RAID volume; then usage is level across all disks automatically.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 11/21/10 2:50 AM, Mahmoud Mubarak wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a machine with different size disks.
