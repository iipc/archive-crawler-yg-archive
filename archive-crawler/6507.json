What part of the release notes gave you that\n&gt;&gt; impression? We&#39;ll correct it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding my interpretation of Heritrix 3 being able to handle updates out of the box, I inferred that from some document which said &quot;Heritrix now assumes a job will be launched multiple times&quot;.\n&gt; So I thought it may be updating it.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you have the most aggressive duplication-reduction settings (sending\n&gt;&gt; &quot;If-Modified&quot;/&quot;If-None-Match&quot; headers and respecting not-changed\n&gt;&gt; responses from servers), and Heritrix is able to skip fetching an\n&gt;&gt; unchanged page entirely, it won&#39;t even have the outlinks to continue the\n&gt;&gt; current crawl. (We don&#39;t carry the discovered links forward in the URI\n&gt;&gt; history info.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, if you want use those settings, it&#39;s up to you to feed the crawler\n&gt;&gt; those URIs from the earlier crawl(s) you want it to re-check.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I wrote a script which fetched all the crawled URI&#39;s and updated the seeds.txt with those URI&#39;s. It updated the mirror but it also crawled the external domains.\n&gt;\n&gt; So on looking into the surts.dump I found the external URI&#39;s were also considered.\n&gt;\n&gt; I figured out that the seeds.txt is used to construct the surts.dump and hence it fetches the external URI&#39;s also.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any other way of supplying URI&#39;s to Heritrix apart from the seeds.txt.\n\nWell, on the SurtPrefixedDecideRule, you can set the \n&#39;seedsAsSurtPrefixes&#39; setting to &#39;false&#39; -- and then it won&#39;t use the \nseeds URIs to define the scope.\n\nNote that your &#39;seeds&#39; text may still include &#39;+&#39; and &#39;-&#39; SURT \ndirectives, which will still be noted by  SurtPrefixedDecideRule with \nACCEPT(+) or REJECT(-) decisions respectively, even if \nseedsAsSurtPrefixes is false.\n\nBut also, you can feed non-seed URIs to a crawl by dropping a file of \nthem into the &#39;action&#39; directory, in a format similar to the &#39;.recovery&#39; \nlog format (which is a 2-character directive, a space, then the URI, \nwith optional other info after the URI)). See here for more details on \nthe kinds of dynamic additions possible via this mechanism:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Action+Directory\n\nTo add URIs, a file of type &#39;.schedule&#39; or &#39;.force&#39; would be \nappropriate. Note that the two-character leading directive can be \nanything for these file types. (The exact directive matters when \nproviding a &#39;.recovery&#39; file type.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sriram.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
