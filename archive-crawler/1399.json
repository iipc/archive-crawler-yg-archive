I have done further tests with \nthese puzzling results:\n\n(1) The problem posted earlier\norg.archive.crawler.datamodel.CrawlURI.ContainsKey(String)\nmethod not found.\n(But the compiler had no problem with curi.ContainsKey(x)).\n\n(2) Does a cast make a difference? no.  Code:\n\n     // Run a quick test on the new AList arrangement\n     ((CandidateURI)bundle).putString(&quot;JunkKey&quot;, &quot;junk&quot;);\n\nRuntime error:\norg.archive.crawler.datamodel.CandidateURI.putString(String,String)\nnot found.  Neither CrawlURI.AListmethod nor CandidateURI.AListmethod\ncan be found.  It&#39;s not an inheritance problem.\n\n(3) How about methods other than the recently moved AList methods? \nExperiment with isSeed():  The code (bundle is a CrawlURI):\n\nSystem.out.println(ME+&quot;CrawlURI.isSeed() is &quot; + bundle.isSeed());\nSystem.out.println(ME+&quot;CandidateURI.isSeed() is &quot; +     \n((CandidateURI)bundle).isSeed());\n\nResult: runs fine.  No run-time errors.  Correct answers printed out.\n\nWhy can the compiler compile my code OK (finds the AList methods)\nbut the runtime can&#39;t?  Why are the older CandidateURI methods all\nOK at run-time, but the newly added AList methods not?  \n\nPuzzled, D.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
