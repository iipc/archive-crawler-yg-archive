If you can step through the relevant \ncode, can you see if Restlet&#39;s &#39;tmp&#39; file is in a surprising (perhaps \ndifferent-filesystem) place?\n\nWe do expect this PUT operation to usually replace an existing file, in \nwhich case the JVM process will need all necessary permissions to do \nthat. If in fact the fallback code works, it seems it must -- but \nperhaps there is a permissions difference whereby the rename can&#39;t work \nbut a write-over can?\n\nOne other intermittent IO trouble that sometimes comes up -- though far \nmore often on Windows, which doesn&#39;t seem a factor here: memory-mapped \nfiles may be locked against desired operations until some indeterminate \ntime after close()ing, waiting for memory-mapped buffer cleanup. (For \nexample &lt;http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4715154&gt;.) I \ndon&#39;t think this is your problem but thought I&#39;d mention it just in case.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nDaniel Truemper wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Hmm that is very odd. Here I was able to send arbitrary data, in utf-8, latin1 and raw binary, and it always comes back unchanged. \n&gt; \n&gt; I finally found some time to debug this. A small bug within Restlet. I have already submitted a Patch [1]!\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically a File.renameTo does not work and a BufferedReader is reading into a BufferedWriter. When writing the &quot;&#92;n&quot; is missing... The question remains, why the renameTo did not work?! Permissions should not prevent this...\n&gt; \n&gt; Best\n&gt; Daniel\n&gt; \n&gt; [1]: http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1018\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
