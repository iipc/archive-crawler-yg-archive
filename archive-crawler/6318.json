I learned that this file should be rather small. I could=\r\n reproduce the errors. Here is an excerpt of my job.log:\n\n18T20:06:21.050Z =\r\nWARNING unable to get character at index=3D4772 (fileIndex=3D4772): java.ni=\r\no.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length =3D 2 (in thread &#39;ToeThread=\r\n #18: http://www.infineon.com/cms/media/career/job24tv.flv&#39;; in processor &#39;=\r\nextractorHtml&#39;)\n2010-01-18T20:06:21.086Z WARNING unable to get character at=\r\n index=3D4773 (fileIndex=3D4773): java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException:=\r\n Input length =3D 2 (in thread &#39;ToeThread #18: http://www.infineon.com/cms/=\r\nmedia/career/job24tv.flv&#39;; in processor &#39;extractorHtml&#39;)\n(..... keeps repea=\r\nting ...)\n\nSo, I guess that therre is an error which probably should not be=\r\n in this file. I guess a better place for logging that exception is in logs=\r\n/alerts.log. But to my surprise this error seems also be logged in alerts.l=\r\nog. \n\nI kept all my files, so that if someone wants to investigate that pro=\r\nblem, I can help with some information. I even can send in the job-descript=\r\nion itself as the error occur quite fast (max. 20 min) after the crawl. \n\nS=\r\no, I will try to exclude *.flv files as I don&#39;t want to store them anyway a=\r\nnd hope it will be better.\n\nCheers,\nTino\n\n\n\n\n"}}
