Looking at the frontier report will reveal \nwhich queue offered the URI, the count of other URIs in that queue, and \nother details. Looking at the threads report will reveal the processor \ncurrently working on the in-process URI.\n\nWith a single queue still holding URIs, and normal politeness settings, \nyou would expect on subsequent viewings of this summary to see the queue \nbouncing from &#39;in-process&#39; to &#39;snoozed&#39; and back, until the queue is \nexhausted. If occasionally new URIs are discovered on other hosts, other \nqueues might reenter active crawling as well.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/26/10 10:00 AM, yotpo.official wrote:\n&gt; I am running with 10 threads and 10 queues and this is my frontier summary after a while:\n&gt;\n&gt;   RUN - 11 URI queues: 1 active (1 in-process; 0 ready; 0 snoozed); 0 inactive; 0 ineligible; 0 retired; 10 exhausted\n&gt;\n&gt; Anybody knows why is it happening?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you very much\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
