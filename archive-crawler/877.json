The\n&gt; command is this &quot;/home/apps/heritrix/bin/heritrix --nowui\n&gt; /home/apps/heritrix/conf/profiles/Simple/order.xml &quot;. The site is\n&gt; crawled with no problems, but this process stays stuck indefinitely.\n&gt; When I ran it manually, I noticed that it would just say &#39;Starting\n&gt; Heritrix...&#39;, and would keep writing a dot and never stop. My question\n&gt; is, how do I crawl a site and than once the site is crawled the\n&gt; heritrix process shuts down. I could have sworn that the same command\n&gt; use to provide that function, but it seems now it just hangs instead.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Ahnu\n\nI hate replying to my own message, but I wanted to update it. It\nappears that the shell script that launches heritrix is hanging, now\nthe java application.\n\n\n"}}
