In &quot;packages.html&quot; inside the main package where Heritrix.java=\r\n is located it talks about a couple things like &quot;admin&quot; which should be loc=\r\nated at: {@link org.archive.crawler.admin org.archive.crawler.admin}, which=\r\n is nowhere to be found, \nas well as the datamodel which is located at:{@li=\r\nnk org.archive.crawler.datamodel org.archive.crawler.datamodel}. I have the=\r\n datamodel package, but it only contains one java file for UriUniqFilter.ja=\r\nva, when the documentation says it is also supposed to contain files such a=\r\ns CandidateURI and CrawlURI, which are both essential. The crawler works, s=\r\no assume they are at least somewhere. Is this just bad documentation? Or ar=\r\ne some of these files gone?\n\nOn a different note, I would also like to find=\r\n the files for the Web UI itself. I assume they are JSP files or Servlets. =\r\nCould someone point me to what package, or folder they might be located in?=\r\n\n\nThanks!\nKeith\n\n\n"}}
