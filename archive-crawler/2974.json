I know there is a &#39;also-check-via&#39; wich\n&gt;&gt; enable to make this one hop outside the domain but i need something\n&gt;&gt; more general for 2 or even more steps. It&#39;s possible?\n\n&gt; You might entertain writing your own custom rule to suit your particular \n&gt; requirements. They&#39;re easy to do and test outside of a running crawl.\n\nFor background, we have a pending request for &quot;n-hops-off&quot; \nfunctionality; see:\n\n[ 1289245 ] n-hops-off decide rule / focus plus N hops scoping\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1289245&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\nIts notes suggest one possible approach.\n\nSome of the work on &#39;heritable&#39; CrawlURI properties done in this \n(finished) RFE could be applicable:\n\n[ 1119608 ] Carry forward (& log) &#39;originating URL/seed&#39; for all URLs\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1119608&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\nThere&#39;s no certainty that the above &quot;n-hops-off&quot; RFE will be prioritized \nfor one of the next few releases... so you may want to implement this \nyourself, and in such a case we&#39;d very much welcome it as a contribution \nto the main codebase. (Also, there may be other or better ways to do \nthis than the notes in the above issues suggest.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n"}}
