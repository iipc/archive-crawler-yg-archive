Looked like a temporary dns lookup\nissue. All the seeds in the recover crawl were &#39; HTTP-200-Success-OK&#39;\nin the seeds report. This alone would result in many URIs discovered\nas the crawl progresses that would not have been located before.\n\nIf I were to start the crawl off exactly as before are you saying that\nI would create the job from initial crawl job, but remove all entries\nfrom the seeds list in the &#39;Settings&#39; view? Not that I would do that\nnow as I want all the seeds to be resolved, but just trying to\nunderstand if that is what you meant by &#39;an empty seed list&#39;.\n\nThanks,\nMike\n\nOn Nov 22, 2007 4:34 AM, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Mike,\n&gt;\n&gt;  How big is the seed list? I believe, but I am not sure, that during the\n&gt;  recovery the seeds would be re-scheduled if you use the original seeds\n&gt;  list. It would be easy to check by exploring the current recover log.\n&gt;  Another reason for the larger queued list can be due the newly scheduled\n&gt;  prerequisites like dns and robots.txt URIs. However, I would think that\n&gt;  would not cause the queued list to triple in size.\n&gt;\n&gt;  In general, when recovering the crawl from the recover log, I have been\n&gt;  using the empty seeds list. When the seeds list is used for scoping, I\n&gt;  would create a separate scope file to mimic wanted scope.\n&gt;\n&gt;  I hope this helps.\n&gt;  i.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Here are the stats taken from the last entries in the\n&gt;  &gt; progress-statistics.log\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; When the original crawl was terminated at day 19 into the crawl:\n&gt;  &gt; discovered queued downloaded\n&gt;  &gt; 4465380 372767 2900208\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Now that the &#39;recoverd&#39; crawl has been running for only 4 hours:\n&gt;  &gt; disovered queued downloaded\n&gt;  &gt; 4469048 1462892 3935\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Estimated Time for the &#39;recovered&#39; crawl to complete as displayed on\n&gt;  &gt; the UI:\n&gt;  &gt; Time\n&gt;  &gt; 4h21m43s elapsed\n&gt;  &gt; 67d5h53m16s remaining (estimated)\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I am a little concerned that it may be recrawling URL already crawled\n&gt;  &gt; by the initial crawl. It seems odd that the queued number (1462892) is\n&gt;  &gt; so high when after 19 days in the initial crawl the queued number was\n&gt;  &gt; only 372767.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks for any help,\n&gt;  &gt; Mike\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Yahoo!
