The url with or without #fragment \ntraditionally would have the same content.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier\n&quot;When an agent &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent&gt; (such as a Web \nbrowser) requests &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods&gt; a \nresource &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_%28Web%29&gt; from a Web \nserver, the agent sends the URI to the server, but does not send the \nfragment. Instead, the agent waits for the server to send the resource, \nand then the agent processes the resource according to the document type \nand fragment value.&quot;\n\nHowever, these days many websites have javascript that serves different \ncontent depending on the #fragment. Google has a scheme for making these \nurls crawler-friendly.\nhttps://code.google.com/intl/sv-SE/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html\nYou might try converting your urls according to this scheme. If the site \nfollows google&#39;s spec then it may be crawlable.\n\n(Enhanced support is planned for heritrix some time in the future, see \nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1761)\n\nNoah\n\n^\nOn 01/19/2012 05:08 AM, hiba117_37 wrote:\n&gt; Hi ,\n&gt;\n&gt; it is my first using of heritrix 3 , and i want to crawl a site have a character # in URL\n&gt;\n&gt; and in the crawler-beans.cxml the character # means a begining of a comment\n&gt;\n&gt; so how can i add this type of urls to seeds value ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for you help\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
