Encoding, if specified, is done on a page by page basis in \nthe HTTP response header and/or in HEAD of the HTML page.  You could set \na mid-fetch filter to look at the former.  For the latter, you would \nneed to probably make your own processor that parsed the HTML HEAD Meta \ninfo to find encoding (our ExtractorHTML doesn&#39;t look for this info IIRC).\n\nBetter would be to not rely on either.  They can disagree and often are \nincorrect.  Better to make a processor that does charset recognition \n(We&#39;ve been talking about doing such a thing for a while now: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=899909&group_id=73833&atid=539102).  \nThen, you could add a filter that ran after the charset guesser to \nfilter out encodings not wanted.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
