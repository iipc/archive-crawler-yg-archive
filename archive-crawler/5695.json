I want to use Heritrix embedded in my application. \n\nI run heritrix separately\n\n&gt; 2. I just want text and HTML content.\n\nWe want feeds so we set our filtering based on content type\n(for example application/atom+xml), you just have to setup\nrules according to your needs\n\n&gt; 3. I will use the crawled data for text mining purpose and not for\n&gt; displaying results or do any search on it. \n\nthe same here\n\n&gt; 4. For #3 reason I wish to clean the content coming in pages as much\n&gt; as possible (read NO HTML/Style/Java Script tags present).\n\nI let heritrix save feeds to ARC format which is native and\nthere is already writer present in heritrix\n\n&gt; 5. Finally I wish to write files on disk in a custom format which goes\n&gt; like this: \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;article&gt;\n&gt; &lt;url&gt;www.example.org&lt;/url&gt;\n&gt; &lt;title&gt;example.org rocks&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; &lt;content&gt;\n&gt; blah blah blah I removed all tags yay.\n&gt; &lt;/content&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/article&gt;\n\nWe run other (our own) application which process ARC files and\nextracts/filters/whatever data from it. It watches over\ndirectory where new ARCs are being created by heritrix and\nprocess them as they come.\n\nNice thing about this is that heritrix just does what it is\nintended for (sort of). It&#39;s independent from the rest of the\napplication.\n\n-r\n\n-- \nRobert Svoboda\nr080@...\n\n"}}
