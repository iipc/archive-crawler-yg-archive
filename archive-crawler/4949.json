I am using the CrawlJobHandler in order to distance myself \nfrom the internals.\n\nNow, it looks like I&#39;ll have to provide a lot more configurability, and \nthat means tying in to heritrix a little more tightly.  So, rather than \ncontinue with 1.12, I decided to try and jump in with 2.0\n\nAnyways, if I want to treat heritrix as an API or a library for \ncrawling, what&#39;s the procedure for setting everything up and executing a \ncrawl?  Here&#39;s the basic flow I want:\n\n1) Configure settings (I assume this involves creating sheets)\n2) Pass settings to heritrix\n3) Start up heritrix\n4) Periodically check status, and possibly send commands like pause or stop\n\n From what I&#39;ve seen in the javadocs, I&#39;m confused about where to start. \n  Do I need to instantiate an Engine object?  A CrawlController?  How do \nI create the settings (sheets?) and pass them where they need to go?\n\nA few pointers on how to start would be great.\n\nThanks,\nMicah Wedemeyer\n\n"}}
