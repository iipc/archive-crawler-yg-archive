For example, if my seed is http://hp.com then it should crawl pages only from http://hp.com and not from any domains or subdomains like http://hp.co.in\n&gt; or http://hp.co.uk.\n\nWith h3, if your seed is http://hp.com, only hp.com will be in scope, except for transclusions (embedded images, css etc). To keep your crawl strictly on the seed sites, remove the TransclusionDecideRule. (Btw hp.co.in is not a subdomain of hp.com. Something like www.hp.com or foo.bar.hp.com would be. But these would not be in scope either with default settings.)\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Further I want to understand how deep heritrix can crawl.If possible someone can\n&gt; explain about max-hops rule. I want to crawl the entire site(exceptions like\n&gt; robots.txt and others are fine).\n\nMost real urls can be reached from seeds within a small number of hops. The max-hops rule is mostly to help heritrix avoid crawler traps, e.g. endless series of links to slightly different urls with the same or no content. You can of course remove the max-hops rule or increase the value. Heritrix can crawl as deep as you configure it to.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also I want to crawl only html response/content and other stuffs like images,js,css,etc should be ignored.\n\nYou don&#39;t always know ahead of time if a url will be html. You can start by excluding urls that end in .jpg, .js, .css of course. And after a url has been crawled you can choose not to archive it, by putting a shouldProcessRule that checks the content-type on your WARCWriterProcessor.\n\nNoah\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using Heritrix 3.1.1 (Final)\n&gt;\n&gt; Is it possible to accomplish those above behaviours?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
