I am not sure what you are      \n&gt; trying       \n&gt;&gt; to do here.      \n&gt;&gt; 3) Accept OnDomainsDecideRule - what is you scope? Do you want to      \n&gt; crawl       \n&gt;&gt; in domain or host scope?      \n&gt;&gt; 3) Again you reject tOnDomainsDecideRule.      \n&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt; Thanks a lot for help.      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt; I&#39;ve added ContentTypeRegExFilter to the      \n&gt; &#39;midfetch-filter&#39; and      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt; &#39;write-processors&#39; sections, and now only html/text      \n&gt; contents are      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt; saved into the ARC file.      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt; The one problem I couldn&#39;t solve is to accept only URIs      \n&gt; that end      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;      &gt; with the specified pattern (for example, &quot;.doc, *.ppt&quot;).      \n&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; What are you trying to do? You want to allow (fetch and process)      \n&gt; only       \n&gt;&gt; .doc and .ppt, but save only html/text to ARC files.      \n&gt;&gt;       \n&gt;&gt; Take care,      \n&gt;&gt; i.      \n&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;       \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
