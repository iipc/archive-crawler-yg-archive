There is to my knowledge\n&gt; no universal OpenMBean connector that would allow non-Java programs\n&gt; to easily\n\nThanks for the information. According J. Steven Perry’s JMX book, open\nmbeans seem to be more intended to deal with problems across Java\nsystems rather than between java & non-java systems. Non-java JMX/mbeans\nimplementations seem to me a pipe dream; and even if we write one for,\nsay, C, we still have to build interfaces for Ruby, Python, Perl, and\nwe still don’t have implementations for other languages.\n\n&gt; Happily, this should change shortly. We are working with several\n&gt; international partners to create a web services interface to Heritrix\n&gt; in the first few months of 2008.\n\nGood news!\n\n&gt; If you or anybody else on the list has specific ideas/features they&#39;d\n&gt; like to see in such an interface, please reply to this thread.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I’m pretty much agreed on this. I think that JMX will never be\n&gt; &gt; sufficient for complete or near-complete solution for complete\n&gt; &gt; remote control of heritrix (\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;re shooting for near-complete.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; including delete of all information related to a job,\n&gt;\n&gt; The current Engine deleteJob method only deletes the job&#39;s\n&gt; subdirectory; if you&#39;re storing logs or BDBs on other disks they\n&gt; aren&#39;t affected. It doesn&#39;t seem like it would be hard to add a new\n&gt; JMX method to &quot;fully delete&quot; a job. Such a method would just scan the\n&gt; settings for a job and delete every file setting mentioned; would you\n&gt; mind opening a Feature Enhancement in JIRA for this?\n\nSorry, I missed that method in the new version. I am more familiar\nwith the last one. That seems reasonable to me, as long as you can\ndelete completed jobs as well as running ones.\n\n&gt; &gt; management of completed jobs,\n&gt;\n&gt; Please say more about this. Other than full removal of a completed\n&gt; job, what other management features would you like to see?\n\nThe ability to query the job in the same way (with the same interface)\nas is used on a running job. I don’t think that there should be two\nways to retrieve the status of a job: on a live job, to call the\nStatus attribute, and on a finished job, to retrieve the 3rd line of\nthe state.job file. You should be able to retrieve the arc files &\nlogs, using the same mechanism that is used to retrieve the arc files\n& logs of a running job. If a job crashed, you should be able to move\nthe job from one machine to another & recover it. (Some of these last\nideas may be impractical or impossible.)\n\n&gt; &gt; retrieval of logs & arcs, etc.);\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the only one I disagree with. Again, I wouldn&#39;t want to\n&gt; implement a whole entire file system inside of Heritrix. Though I\n&gt; suppose simple read-only streaming for large files may be desirable\n&gt; enough to warrant the extra effort, especially if we&#39;re embedding an\n&gt; HTTP service anyway.\n\nIt’s pretty trivial to add streaming of files to a decent HTTP\ninterface; a few lines of code.\n\nIn our service we give reports to the user which depend on being able\nto retrieve & process the entire crawl.log, so it would be nice to\nhave a way to get complete copy of the logs with minimal effort.\n\nbest,\nErik Hetzner\n;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Tue_Dec_18_11:40:46_2007-1\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Tue_Dec_18_11:40:46_2007-1--\r\n\n"}}
