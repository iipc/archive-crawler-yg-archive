Feel free to put a feature request in jira: http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER\n\nNoah\n\nGreg Allen wrote:\n&gt; I have a couple of questions about Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does it support POST? For example, I want to crawl sites that have\n&gt; dropdown boxes and submit buttons. I&#39;d like to iterate the combinations\n&gt; in the dropdown boxes (by parsing and extracting them from the HTML on \n&gt; the page) and then POST the results back to the site, retrieving yet\n&gt; another page.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is that something that could be done by extending Heritrix some way?\n&gt; Or does it already support this type of crawling?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n\n"}}
