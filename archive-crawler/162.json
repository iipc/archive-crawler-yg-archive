Now I&#39;m trying to\n&gt; make a crawl that takes just the front URL from each of a number of\n&gt; sites, but the new version doesn&#39;t seem to have the max-embed-depth\n&gt; parameter of a few weeks ago.  Just to sanity check:  Is it in there\n&gt; somewhere, or shall I make my own filter for it?\n\nIt&#39;s now the &quot;max-trans-hops&quot; attribute on the &lt;scope&gt; element,\nbecause it serves as a limit on other forms of &quot;transitive&quot;\ninclusion of URIs, as well as embedded resources.\n\nFor example, preconditions (robots/dns), META-refreshes,\nJavascript-speculative-guesses, and HTTP redirects all count\nas transitive hops.\n\nSo to achieve what it seems you want: add each of the sites you\nwant to crawl to the seeds, set the &quot;max-link-hops&quot; to zero,\nset the &quot;max-trans-hops&quot; to something likely to get all\nlegitimately transcluded URIs, but able to cut pathological\nsituations short. (I currently think 5 is a good value.)\n\nKeep the questions coming!\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
