(I think our largest has been closer to 1 million.) It&#39;s also \nrare for us &gt;&gt;to request a seeds report on large crawls while they are \nrunning. I suspect it&#39;s the building of the seeds report in memory \nthat&#39;s either &gt;&gt;triggering or contributing to your issue.\n &gt;&gt;Do you need the report, or can you get the necessary info from the logs?\n &gt;No, we don&#39;t need the seed report. The information in the log files \nand our additional logging is more than enough.\n\n &gt;&gt;We don&#39;t want any valid request for a seeds report to crash the \ncrawler, so there&#39;s something for us to fix here. However, the answer\n &gt;&gt;might be to cap the size of a seed report viewable by the web UI -- \nthat is, protect by limiting risky functionality.  \n &gt;Please not that in our seed list are some error lines integrated (the \nlines have a RDF-NQuad format)\n &gt;(Just know i recognise all the warnings from the \norg.archive.util.iterator.RegexpLineIterator, and i have in mind that \nthe regex handling &gt;with java can cause serious problems. Could this be \nthe reason for the GC thing?)\n \n &gt;&gt;As noted above, the rescanning of the seeds file to compile the full \nreport is likely related. There&#39;s nothing inherently troubling about \nJava &gt;&gt;regex handling, especially in this line-by-line scanning of \nwell-formed input (no deep recursion, even give your error lines). It&#39;s \nmore the &gt;&gt;size of the report data being assembled at the same time the \nrest of the crawl is trying to proceed.\n\nWe discovered that we need to crawl a large list of URIs without \ntraversing outgoing links.\nIs their a way to disable the seed reports or does this involve changes \nin the code? (We do not want to split the list into bunches of 1M URIs)\n\nBest\n  juergen\n\n"}}
