From the perspective of \nsomeone just trying to embed heretrix via good old fashioned API calls, \nit makes everything extremely confusing.\n\nPaul was kind enough to make a change that allowed getting an Engine&#39;s \nSheetManager via a non-JMX call, but not I&#39;m struggling with adding \ncrawl status listeners.  The previous method (implement the \nCrawlStatusListener interface) seems intuitive to me.  The new method \n(??? something to do with ListModuleListener and the sheet manager) has \nstumped me so far, and I&#39;m about ready to give up.  I&#39;ve been through \nthe code, and the closest thing I could find was addFinishedCallback in \nEngineImpl, but I don&#39;t really understand what it&#39;s doing, and try as I \nmight, I can&#39;t get similar code to work for me.\n\nSo, am I barking up the wrong tree trying to embed heritrix 2?  I&#39;m sure \nmaking embedding hard is not a goal for 2.0, but was easy embedding \nscratched from the list?  I really like the new sheets as compared to \nthe orders xml, but at least that&#39;s a beast I know how to tangle with.\n\nTo be specific, all I need at this point is to be able to configure a \ncrawl (change a few settings in the sheet...this I know how to do), fire \nit up, be notified when it finishes, and be able to stop it prematurely. \n  I&#39;m pretty clear on everything except the notification.  Right now, \nI&#39;m leaning towards just watching the job directory name and waiting for \nit to change to &quot;completed&quot;.  Still, that seems a little inelegant.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated,\nMicah Wedemeyer\nWoodruff Library, Emory University\n\n"}}
