As such it gave us\ncertain insights into the general problem and ultimately showed that it was\nmuch more difficult than we had hoped.\n\nBasically, absent accurate change detection the adaptive part is extremely\nhard to achieve. As my paper discusses, this is a problem without a viable\nsolution.\n\nThere were also issues with limiting the scope of crawls. Truly incremental\ncrawls require that the scope be finite (i.e. no crawler traps). Possible\nfor small crawls, this becomes increasingly difficult as the scope expands. \n\nThe above led me to rethink the whole approach. If we couldn&#39;t use adaptive\ntechniques, then the likely value of a truly incremental crawling style was\ngreatly diminished. The, much simplified, alternative (which has proven a\ngreat success) is described in this article: \nhttp://vefsofnun.bok.hi.is/upload/3/ManagingDuplicatesAcrossSequentialCrawls\n.pdf\n\nBasically, it is a simple filter to eliminate duplicate documents in a\nseries of crawls.\n\nThis has proven extremely successful and has been used by the national\nlibraries of Iceland and Denmark (and possibly others I don&#39;t know about)\nfor the last year or so.\n\nSee further: http://deduplicator.sourceforge.net\n\nThe Internet Archive added a similar ability directly to the crawler as of\nversion 1.12.0. I haven&#39;t tested it myself, but I&#39;ve heard that it performs\nquite well. There are plans at the IA to address the notion of incremental\ncrawling again but this will not happen until later this year and it is\nunclear exactly how that will happen.\n\nThe ARFrontier has received no attention of late and currently we are\nconsidering dropping it from the upcoming 2.0.0 release, although this is\nstill undecided. As far as I know nobody is using it. It seems unlikely that\nit will be developed further barring 3rd party contributions to the project.\n\nHope that answers your questions. \n\n- Kris\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com on behalf of lorengordon\nSent: Wed 6/13/2007 3:42 PM\nTo: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [archive-crawler] Incremental Crawlling and the\nAdaptiveRevisitingFrontier\n \nI&#39;m interesting in the incremental crawling presented in this document:\nhttp://www.iwaw.net/05/papers/iwaw05-sigurdsson.pdf\n&lt;http://www.iwaw.net/05/papers/iwaw05-sigurdsson.pdf&gt; \n\nIs anyone using the AdaptiveRevisitingFrontier that was developed as a\nresult of that study?
