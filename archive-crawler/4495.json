I used the Import feature in Eclipse. Initially the project\n&gt; name had a red X on it, which I discovered was the result of certain library\n&gt; includes not pointing the same versions included in the\n&gt; heritrix-1.12.1source downloaded. By right clicking on the project --&gt;\n&gt; properties --&gt;\n&gt; hightlight &#39;Java Build Path&#39; --&gt; I clicked on each one with a library jar\n&gt; with a yellow ! and Edited the location by browsing to the proper one\n&gt; dowloaded. This corrected the classpath issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; My problem is now the project folder listed in the Project Explorer window\n&gt; now has a yellow exclamation. Expanding the main project folder I can see\n&gt; that the &#39;src/java&#39; folder also has the yellow exclamation. In drilling down\n&gt; further most of the java c;ass files also have this as well. In looking at\n&gt; the source for each class I highlight the small yellow bands which note an\n&gt; error of some type and I get the following:\n&gt; ex. &quot;Iterator is a raw type. References to generic type Iterator &lt;E&gt; should\n&gt; be parameterized&quot;\n&gt; ex. &quot;ListType is a raw type. References to generic type ListType &lt;T&gt; should\n&gt; be parameterized&quot;\n&gt; All the errors seem to be of the type listed in the two examples here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there something I am doing wrong in importing? If you can point me to\n&gt; documentation anywhere on pulling in Heritrix source and getting setup to\n&gt; build/compile and test out changes it would be greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/6/07, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;   The eclipse dot files must not be bundled into the src tarball.\n&gt;&gt; Download them individually here from the heritrix_1_12 src branch --\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; https://archive-crawler.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/archive-crawler/branches/heritrix_1_12/\n&gt;&gt; -- and put them manually into your unbundled src (or checkout the branch).\n&gt;&gt; St.Ack\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; mjjjhjemj wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I have downloaded the latest Heritrix source from Sourceforge -\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.12.1.

I am interested in\n&gt;&gt;&gt; making some changes to MirrorWriter and compiling the build and\n&gt;&gt;&gt; running tests on the changes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for any help,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Mike\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
