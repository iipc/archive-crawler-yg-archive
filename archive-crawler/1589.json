For instance, I may be only looking for pages\n&gt; that contain the word &quot;acre&quot; or &quot;juniper,&quot; or only pages that have\n&gt; links to more than two .mpeg movies. Of course, the more useful things\n&gt; are more complex.\n&gt; \n\nI should probably be more specific here.  I am a forensic pathologist,\nand am interested in searching various sites for information and\nimagery involving patterned injury of the skin.  I am, for instance,\nwriting an atlas of patterned injury in order to help people determine\nwhat object was used in an assault (hammer, crowbar, etc.) from the\npatterns those objects leave on the skin.\n\nI am interested in searching hardware sites for specific kinds of\nimplements, and searching medical sites for images of skin injury.\n\nI happen to have some formal training in Computer Science, and can\nwrite code in Java, C++, C, python, perl, and a few others (even --\nnot to show my age, APL, God help me; I still have a keyboard laying\naround for it).  So, I&#39;m happy to write a parser or whatever if I can\nget a handle on how to fit it in here (or where to fit it in).\n\nbillo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
