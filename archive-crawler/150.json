This is a good plan for beginning implementation work. \n\nSome comments/questions interspersed below:\n&gt; 1.1 Administrative and Monitoring Overview\n&gt; \n&gt; Administrative part of the interface should consist of three different \n&gt; &#39;panels&#39;, one control and two configuration panels. The control panel \n&gt; should consist of start, stop, pause, checkpoint, resume, and terminate \n&gt; options. First configuration panel should be the crawl configuration panel \n&gt; where the crawl is a web collection that will be harvest.  Second \n&gt; configuration panel should be the crawler&#39;s configuration panel where the \n&gt; crawler is a group of Heritrix configurable modules.\n&gt; Monitoring part of the interface should consist of Heritrix reports such \n&gt; as progress and data captured, errors, and crawler status reports.\n&gt; This interface should also provide some basic authentication mechanism.\n\nAs with navigational headers on a website, some standard grouping\nof status info and controls should appear on every page served by\nthe embedded webserver. For example...\n\n   Crawling &quot;_Fredonia2003_&quot; [ _Pause_ | _More Options_ ]\n   123,456 URIs collected [ _More stats_ ]\n   Checkpoint #2: 98,765 URIs at 2003-10-01 03:45 \n\n&gt; 2. Administrative Panels\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.1 Control Panel\n&gt; \n&gt; The control panel should provide start, stop, checkpoint, pause, resume, \n&gt; and terminate options. The operator should be able to use these options at \n&gt; all times.\n\nThese names/descriptions could be further cleared up: \n\n&gt; Start - starts the crawler.\n\nIs this &quot;start specifying a new crawl&quot; or &quot;begin crawling according\nto an already-filled out specification&quot;? \n\n&gt; Stop - stops the crawler. When crawler is stopped with this option it can \n&gt; be resumed from last checkpoint.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pause (optional?)- stops crawling but not the crawler. This option will \n&gt; pause (put to sleep) crawler&#39;s workers. Similar effect can be achieved by \n&gt; checkpoint followed by stop options therefore pause option may be \n&gt; redundant. \n&gt; \n&gt; Resume - resumes stopped/paused crawler. Stopped crawl is resumed from \n&gt; last known checkpoint. Paused crawl is resumed by waking up paused \n&gt; workers. \n&gt;\n&gt; Checkpoint - it writes current crawler&#39;s state to a disk.\n&gt; \n\nIs there a way to freeze the crawler, change settings, and then \nunfreeze it without requiring a checkpoint? \n\nA state diagram showing how the UI options push a crawl through\nits various states would be helpful, including the states before\nthe crawl is adequately configured to run (eg has no seeds, etc.).\n\n&gt; Terminate - it shutdowns the server and all crawl activities.\n\n&quot;Shutdown&quot; might be a better name for this option, and a warning/\nconfirm should be required, as this option kills all OS processes\nrunning the WUI and crawler.\n\n&gt; 2.2 Crawler Configuration Panel \n&gt;  \n&gt; The crawler configuration panel should consist of Heritrix configurable \n&gt; modules. Heritrix current modules are:\n&gt; -   selector\n&gt; -   scheduler\n&gt; -   store\n&gt; -   preprocessor\n&gt; -   DNS fetcher\n&gt; -   HTTP fetcher\n&gt; -   HTTP extractor\n&gt; -   HTML extractor\n&gt; -   MSDOC extractor\n&gt; -   SWF extractor\n&gt; -   PDF extractor\n&gt; -   archiver\n&gt; Default mode of the interface should hide this configuration panel. The \n&gt; panel should be available in &#39;advance&#39; mode. In this mode the operator \n&gt; should be able to add, change or reconfigure any of these modules. The \n&gt; operator should also be able to load any pre-existing XML \n&gt; configuration file in both modes.\n\nHow do modules announce to the UI what sorts of configurable\noptions they offer? Should we use java &quot;bean&quot; conventions?\n\n&gt; 3. Monitoring and Progress Reports \n&gt; \n&gt; The monitoring part of the interface should provide the operator with \n&gt; crawler&#39;s reports on progress and captured data, status, and \n&gt; errors. \n&gt; All statistics will be updated on demand by the operator or by \n&gt; &#39;auto-refresh&#39; option.\n\nIn addition to the other reports you listed, there needs to be\na way to perform the equivalent of a &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;less&quot; on key \nprogress and error logs. \n\n&gt; 4. Authentication Panel\n&gt; \n&gt; The interface authentication should be a HTTP &quot;Basic&quot; or &quot;Digest&quot; \n&gt; authentication. Only a single username/password is necessary for the \n&gt; foreseeable future.\n&gt; This one username/password pair could be specified on the command-line. \n&gt; All traffic of the interface should be logged.\n\nThis isn&#39;t really a panel; rather, attempts to use any portion of\nthe UI will trigger a login challenge if the user is not already \nlogged in.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
