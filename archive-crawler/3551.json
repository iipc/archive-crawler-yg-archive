Doesn&#39;t sound like much,\nbut the numbers get huge, and clog the system.  With the frontier\noff, they fall off the count.  Its fun to watch the count of\ndownloaded + queued drop fast.\n\nThroughput falls on its face though, something to do with not\nfollowing up on a current web site in the frontier.  Cause, duh,\nnew stuff isn&#39;t appearing on the frontier.\n\nJohn\n\n\nMichael Stack wrote:\n\n&gt; Have you tried disabling the FrontierScheduler once the crawler goes\n&gt; past 120M fetched? You might even be able to set the disabled flag from\n&gt; JMX. If so, since you can get counts of crawled and queued via JMX, you\n&gt; could automate switching off the processor.\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise, do you have a patch for the below for us to apply Joe?\n&gt;\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt; joehung302 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We&#39;ve been using heritrix with crawl map for crawling &gt; 1B urls. We\n&gt; &gt; current have 8 crawl machines at one time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Under this configuration, the crawl can only be successful if the\n&gt; &gt; crawlers don&#39;t fail. Hence we&#39;re really focused on how to keep the\n&gt; &gt; crawler running as long as possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We thought it might be a good idea to *limit* bdb growth after\n&gt; &gt; certain size. And we also know that bdb size has a lot to do with\n&gt; &gt; the to-be-crawled URL list. Hence the question: Does it make sense\n&gt; &gt; to set a upper limit on the Frontier so, when the to-be-cralwed URL\n&gt; &gt; reached a certain number (say, 120M urls), stop collecting to-be-\n&gt; &gt; crawled and throw any new links away? The idea is, in order to\n&gt; &gt; download 120M URLs, we probably would have a to-be-crawled list of\n&gt; &gt; 400M, and bdb probably won&#39;t survive under that size.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Does it make sense?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; cheers,\n&gt; &gt; -Joe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
