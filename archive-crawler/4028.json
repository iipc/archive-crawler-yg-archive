It provides great \nflexibility to an operator. It allows you to use scripting on CrawlURI \ndirectly.\n\n- Decide rules sequence (basically a filter) has been added to the \nprocessors since 1.8. We used decide rules filter on HashCrawlMapper so \nthat all embeds (hop path ends with E) were always fetched locally (not \ndiverted). If you are not planning on cross feeding URIs among the nodes \nbut want to ensure that certain URIs are always fetched, this might be a \ngood approach. Be aware that you might fetch duplicates.\n\n- You might want to take a look at AntiCalendarCostAssignmentPolicy. The \nresults of using it have not been analyzed as much as we would like but \nmight be something to try. This cost assignment policy basically pushes \nURIs with calendar like strings in them to the back of host queues.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\ni.\n\nP.S. If you want to send the order.xml file(s) I would be more than \nhappy to take a look at it and see if we can help more.\n\n\n\nGordon Mohr wrote:\n&gt; joehung302 wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s that time again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We&#39;re going to try 2.5B (maybe more) this time. We&#39;ve upgrade our \n&gt;&gt; bandwidth to 250Mbps, all year round.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So that means we&#39;re going to keep the crawlers run until they \n&gt;&gt; fall. ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Before we start crawling, as usual, more questions:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1. Should we upgrade to 1.12? (We were using 1.8, we know we have to \n&gt;&gt; use 1.10 because of the POST bug).\n&gt; \n&gt; I am always partial to the latest releases, though you may want to make \n&gt; the determination based on your own reading of the changes/issues. Of \n&gt; 1.12.0-fixed issues, a couple that might be of interest to a broad/deep \n&gt; crawl would be:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-4\n&gt;   - don&#39;t misparse robots.txt if &#39;crawl-delay&#39;/&#39;allow&#39; directives present\n&gt; \n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1085\n&gt;   - fetch additional URIs with &#39;|&#39; in them\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 2. Any Java parameter settings? Last time I tried the HotSpot server \n&gt;&gt; VM and it was not usable after a couple days. I ended up having to \n&gt;&gt; specify &quot;client mode&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; We haven&#39;t had a problem with server/HotSpot mode, so no opinion here. \n&gt; (Most of our crawls currently use the Sun 1.5.0_07 JVM.)\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 3. Need more explanation on this &#39;reduce-prefix-pattern&#39; trick. How \n&gt;&gt; does it help in a long crawl?\n&gt; \n&gt; The intent is to ensure related subdomains land on the same crawler. The \n&gt; main benefit is that it gives you a single place to make mid-crawl \n&gt; changes that affect them all. (In the future, it could also assist \n&gt; improved IP or parent-domain-based politeness.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s a reduction pattern (not necessarily a *good* pattern, but an \n&gt; illustrative one) that was used while testing the capability:\n&gt; \n&gt; ^((&#92;w&#92;w&#92;w,&#92;w*)|((au|uk),&#92;w*,&#92;w*)|[&#92;w,]{8})\n&gt; \n&gt; Its intent with respect to SurtAuthorityQueueAssignment classKeys was:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) If it&#39;s a COM/ORG/NET domain, use up through the 2nd-level domain\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) If it&#39;s a 2-letter TLD known to have broad subdomains (AU/UK with \n&gt; their com.au, co.uk, etc. subdomains), use up through the 3rd-level domain\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) For all other cases, use the first 8 characters of the classKey. \n&gt; (The untested theory being that all such other cases are a small % of \n&gt; hosts so that even if this rule is awfully uneven, it won&#39;t make much of \n&gt; a difference.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sure better reduction patterns are possible depending on what you&#39;re \n&gt; crawling; I believe we&#39;ve used other variants of this for our 6-machine \n&gt; crawls.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; 4. Anything you think might be helpful for us to know?\n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re the trailblazers in this regard -- nothing I can think of offhand \n&gt; but please let us know of any issues you encounter. We&#39;re starting our \n&gt; own 2+ billion page Heritrix crawl this summer. (See: \n&gt; http://wa.archive.org/aroundtheworld/ ).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best luck!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot,\n&gt;&gt; -Joe\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
