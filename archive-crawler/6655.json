You are great!=\r\n\nI still facing some problem when I am using heritrix:\n1.Why is it take me =\r\na very long time to archive a website even though I already set the depth a=\r\nnd hosts to vry minimun:1 or 2 level.\n2. Why is it sometimes the archived p=\r\nrogress reach till 99% and it will hang there then it take long hours to fi=\r\nnished.\n3. Can we avoid to fill in the http-header-user agent and provide t=\r\nhe email address... or can we preset it instead of every time when I archiv=\r\ned, I need to fill it in.\n4.Can I categorized my archived work? Say,\nEducat=\r\nion website: www.abc.com, www.bcd.com, www.efg.com\nGoverment website: www.x=\r\nyz.com, www.hij.com, www.klm.com\nMusic website: www.lmn.com, www.opq.com\n5.=\r\n Can heritrix perform scheduling task? This is beacuase every 2 months I ne=\r\ned to re-archive the same websites, IS it possible to automate it, so that =\r\nevery 2 month it will auto acrchive the websites.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n\n\n--=\r\n- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; O=\r\nn 8/4/10 7:30 PM, HyuuGaBaDita wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Gordon!

But can I remove the\n&gt; &gt; login page a=\r\nnd directly go into the heritrix mainpage?\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are visiting from th=\r\ne same browser without having quit and \n&gt; relaunched the browser, you won&#39;t=\r\n be prompted again. In most browsers, \n&gt; even with a quit and relaunch, the=\r\n values can be saved so you won&#39;t have \n&gt; to re-type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why do you need =\r\nto eliminate even that step? (Is there something else \n&gt; you&#39;re trying to a=\r\nchieve?)\n&gt; \n&gt; You should also review this page about why it is important to=\r\n limit \n&gt; access to the administrative interface:\n&gt; \n&gt; https://webarchive.j=\r\nira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Security+Considerations\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2.Thanks for t=\r\nhe depthe level setting advice ! It works!!!! and I am\n&gt; &gt; gald abt it! Tha=\r\nnks!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3. I still don&#39;t understand how to download more than a websit=\r\ne at\n&gt; &gt; the same time. Is it I just type in all the url addresses in the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; seeds textbox, line by line then add in once again all the url\n&gt; &gt; addre=\r\nsss in the http-header-user agent text box by adding &quot;+&quot; sign.\n&gt; &gt; For exam=\r\nple: seeds text box: http://www.abc.com http://www.def.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http-hea=\r\nder-user agent text box: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;\n&gt; &gt; heritrix/1.14.3 +http=\r\n://www.abc.com +http://www.def.com)\n&gt; \n&gt; You should not be putting the URLs=\r\n of the sites you&#39;re crawling into the \n&gt; &#39;http-user-agent&#39; value!\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n HTTP &#39;User-Agent&#39; header is to identify *you* to sites, allowing \n&gt; them t=\r\no contact you if anything goes wrong. The URL should be an URL \n&gt; that desc=\r\nribes your purpose in crawling and includes contact information \n&gt; such as =\r\nan email address or phone number.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is covered in the H1 User Manua=\r\nl, among other places:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual=\r\n/config.html#httpheaders\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4.Why is it after we key in the url in the =\r\nseed box then we need to\n&gt; &gt; re-keyin the url once agin into the http-heade=\r\nr-user agent text box\n&gt; &gt; and somemore we need to provide our email add in =\r\nthe &quot;from&quot; texbox?\n&gt; &gt; It seems like doing double work. Can we simplify thi=\r\ns? Is there any\n&gt; &gt; easier way on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; See above.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5.I facing t=\r\nhe remote access problem. I installed my heritrix in a\n&gt; &gt; PC, then when I =\r\nusing my laptop to remote access it to the PC, the\n&gt; &gt; heritrix show blank =\r\npage.\n&gt; \n&gt; See the User Manual, especially the &#39;Note&#39; under here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http=\r\n://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/install.html#N1008F\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Plea=\r\nse help me and guide me.\n&gt; \n&gt; You should do a front-to-back read of the Use=\r\nr Manual, review the \n&gt; project wiki, and follow/search others&#39; questions i=\r\nn this discussion \n&gt; list -- as these questions already have written answer=\r\ns in many places.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance, HyuuGaBaDita=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr&lt;gojomo@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On 8/3/10 9:23 PM, HyuuGaBaDita wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.
