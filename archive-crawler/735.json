Hadn&#39;t noticed about the socket stuff\nand the CDX functionality.\n\n&gt; &gt;We would like to see at some point of time a package that combines\n&gt; &gt;the best features of both the DK and the IA package. Ideally this \n&gt; &gt;package should:\n&gt; &gt;  - Be a small, closed enitity.\n&gt; &gt;  - Be able to mimic the most important Alexa tools.\n&gt; &gt;  - Support both .arc and .arc.gz.\n&gt; &gt;  - Provide efficient and convenient access to a single object\n&gt; &gt;    given a file and an offset.\n&gt; &gt;  - Provide efficient and convenient traversal of archives.\n&gt; &gt;  - Provide convenient writing of ARC (and .arc.gz) files.\n&gt; &gt;    (Large-scale efficient writing may be left out - this is more \nof\n&gt; &gt;     a harvester issue).\n\n&gt; All of the above sounds good.  Would be good to break the reading \nand \n&gt; writing of ARCs out of the crawler and have it instead include a \njar.\n\nI agree. I managed to sepearate out a subset of the code that \nwas &quot;not much\nlarger&quot; than the parts of archive.org.io.arc that I needed, but it \nwasn&#39;t\neasy (when you&#39;re new to the code, like I was).\n\n&gt; &gt;public class ShareableARCRecord{\n&gt; &gt;    public ShareableARCRecord(ARCRecord record,File file);\n&gt; &gt;    public File getFile();\n&gt; &gt;    public ARCRecordMetaData getMetaData();\n&gt; &gt;    public byte[] readAll() throws IOException;\n&gt; &gt;    public InputStream getObjectAsInputStream() throws IOException;\n&gt; &gt;}\n\n&gt; &gt;The File is just the name of the file in which the record\n&gt; &gt;was found.\n&gt; &gt;This is useful for indexing information.\n&gt; &gt;As the class name indicates, the two latter methods may be called\n&gt; &gt;any number of times without &quot;interference&quot;.\n\n&gt; Should we add the arc file name to ARCRecord metadata?\n\nI think that would be really good. My above code is a hack\nthat superficially adds the information. :-|\n\n&gt;(Not full-path,  just the name)?\n\nI would prefer it as a java.io.File? This is the infomation supplied\nto the ARCReaderFactory, and the absolute path can be retrieved from\nit if needed (as it might be when building an index).\n\nThanks again,\nNiels\n\n\n\n"}}
