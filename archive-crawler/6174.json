Of course, a true &#39;TLD&#39; is\nonly the last/&#39;topmost&#39; domain, such as .COM or .DK. And the\n&#39;second-level-domain&#39; isn&#39;t necessarily the level of\nassignment/hostname-sale -- it&#39;s sometimes 3rd-level, and occasionally\neven 4th- or more. So &#39;assignment-level-domain&#39; can be used to\ncommunicate: whatever level has been registered/sold by a registrar to a\nsingle entity.\n\nH3 isn&#39;t going to solve this issue outright, but does open a few new \npossibilities, because the politeness delay is calculated outside the \nfrontier, and thus easily adjustable by a custom Processor (instead of \ndeeper frontier customization). Also, the ScriptedProcessor can be \ncustomized in Javascript/Beanshell/Groovy without requiring any Java \nchanges or new libraries.\n\nFor example, one of the workarounds we&#39;ve sometimes applied manually \nafter noticing there&#39;s a problem is setting a much-longer politeness \ndelay for affected domains. Then the average rate certain IPs are hit \nstays reasonable -- even though it&#39;s not as strictly enforced as the \nbuilt-in politeness mechanism.\n\nCode to automate this process could in H3 be dropped in as an optional \ncustom Processor -- increasing delays on any queue that it notices (via \nits own rolling tracking) is offering URLs against an over-trafficked IP.\n\nAnother thing you could consider -- in H1 or H3 -- is trying the \nexisting IPQueueAssignmentPolicy, for exact IP-based politeness, but \nreplacing or extending QuotaEnforcer so that it bases its cutoff \ndecision on a separate tally that is completely independent of the \nfrontier queue-groupings.\n\nThis might be a good idea because overloading the frontier queues to \nserve as both the atom of serialized-request/politeness calculations, \nand other reporting/allocation decisions, will always involve some \ntradeoffs/conflicts. (For example, what if you&#39;ve arranged both \nA.FOO.COM and B.FOO.COM to go into a single FOO.COM ALD frontier queue \n-- but B.FOO.COM is on a completely different, perhaps overloaded or \nunresponsive host. Connection timeouts or politeness delays applied \nbecause of B.FOO.COM&#39;s behavior might then interfere with the collection \nof A.FOO.COM URLs more than you&#39;d like.)\n\nWe may yet come up with a good design for freely mixing whatever \nqueue-groupings are most convenient with other completely-orthogonal \npoliteness/quota rules... but investigation so far suggests that&#39;s hard \nto do without making the frontier even more complicated, and adding new \nrisks of deadlock or imbalanced progress. I hope the ideas above can \nhelp in the meantime.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Best\n&gt; Bjarne andersen\n&gt; Netarchive.dk\n&gt; \n&gt; Sent fra min HTC Touch Pro\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Fra: kristsi25 &lt;kris@...&gt;\n&gt; Sendt: 19. november 2009 17:09\n&gt; Til: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com &lt;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Emne: [archive-crawler] Re: Avoiding overloading webservers hosting many \n&gt; virtual servers\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; John pretty much sums up the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; The way I&#39;ve dealt with this has been on a case by case basis. Each time \n&gt; we detect this situation, we override the frontier&#39;s \n&gt; &quot;force-queue-assignment&quot; setting to ensure that all the domains are \n&gt; dumped in the same politeness bucket.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is quite simple when you are dealing with a multitude of \n&gt; sub-domains as you can just throw in the override on the parent domain.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:archive-crawler%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, John Lekashman &lt;lekash@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Hi,\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; It is not actually possible to guarantee this.\n&gt;  &gt; There is no real way to distinguish for sure where the actual physical\n&gt;  &gt; hardware that hosts a name is.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; There has been some discussion of adding IP addresses to the politeness\n&gt;  &gt; capability, which\n&gt;  &gt; would do some of it.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; But, that would be defeated if the provider doing the service has given\n&gt;  &gt; separate IP addresses\n&gt;  &gt; to each virtual server, e.g. as would be done if they had ssl clients on\n&gt;  &gt; each virtual machine.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Another thing that can be considered is to extend politeness behavior\n&gt;  &gt; into parent domains,\n&gt;  &gt; e.g. act polite across all of:\n&gt;  &gt; *.foo.com\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Which would again handle some of it, if the virtual servers all had a\n&gt;  &gt; common parent.\n&gt;  &gt; Of course, this would be wrong for large scale domains spread across\n&gt;  &gt; multiple disparate\n&gt;  &gt; locations.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; If your scope is relatively small, you can also put those things you\n&gt;  &gt; detect as virtual servers in a separate\n&gt;  &gt; crawl job, turn off in the other job, increase the inter arrival time,\n&gt;  &gt; and limit the number of threads to slow it all down.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; These are all workarounds for the problem, that may help a little.\n&gt;  &gt; There are probably others you can try.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Its just that the Internet architecture was designed such that the\n&gt;  &gt; bandwidth limiting\n&gt;  &gt; should happen lower in the stack, like at the border router to that\n&gt;  &gt; actual virtualized machine,\n&gt;  &gt; or on the overloaded host itself, and most ISPs have no incentive to do\n&gt;  &gt; so.
