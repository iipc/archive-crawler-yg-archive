Such revisits\n&gt;     can easily be stored i=\r\nn ARC files but may confuse some\n&gt;     post-crawl reporting and access prac=\r\ntices.\n&gt; \n&gt;   - Request-headers (including HTTP-authentication or\n&gt;     coo=\r\nkies) and POST data are not currently stored in\n&gt;     ARC files, but may be=\r\n necessary for understanding the\n&gt;     (different) results returned. The AR=\r\nC format must\n&gt;     be extended soon.\n&gt; \n\nHere is a proposal for an extensi=\r\non of the arc format in order to \naccommodate more detailed metadata. \n\nAn =\r\nentry for a http response currently looks like this in the ARC \nformat usin=\r\ng the url-record-v1 format:\n\nhttp://&lt;url1&gt; &lt;ip1&gt; &lt;timestamp1&gt; &lt;mime-type1&gt; =\r\n&lt;data-size1&gt;\n&lt;DATA1 =96 http header, response data&gt;\n\nWhen data are collecte=\r\nd using the HTTP post method ambiguities may \narise as multiple requests fo=\r\nr different web pages may be represented \nby the same url. An additional he=\r\nader field is proposed added to the \nARC header to resolve these ambiguitie=\r\ns. \n\nhttp://&lt;url1&gt; &lt;ip1&gt; &lt;timestamp1&gt; &lt;mime-type1&gt; \n&lt;data-size1&gt; &lt;request-e=\r\nncoding1&gt;\n&lt;DATA1 =96 http header, response data&gt;\n\nThe new field request-enc=\r\noding is an MD5 checksum created from the \nhttp request. This encoding can =\r\nbe used to distinguish between \ndifferent post requests. Notice that only a=\r\n relevant subset of the \ncomplete http request should be used to create the=\r\n checksum. This \nsubset must include the url, the message body, and possibl=\r\ny the \nauthentication information and cookie values. We do not want to \ninc=\r\nlude fields such as Accept, Referrer, Host and User-Agent as they \ndo not d=\r\nefine the content of the requested page.\n\nThis format still lacks detailed =\r\ninformation about the http request \nheader and does not provide means to ad=\r\nd additional meta-data \ninformation. It is proposed that additional meta-da=\r\nta information is \nstored using the format:\n\nmetadata:http://&lt;url2&gt; &lt;ip2&gt; &lt;=\r\ntimestamp2&gt; text/xml \n&lt;data size2&gt; &lt;request-encoding2&gt;\n&lt;DATA2 =96 metadata =\r\nfor url&gt;\n\nWhere \n&lt;url1&gt;=3D&lt;url2&gt;\n&lt;ip1&gt; =3D &lt;ip2&gt;\n&lt;timestamp1&gt; =3D &lt;timestam=\r\np2&gt;\n&lt;request-encoding1&gt;=3D&lt;request-encoding2&gt;\n\n\nThe DATA2 section is an xml=\r\n representation of various metadata \navailable during collection of the url=\r\n object. This information must \nas a minimum contain the complete http requ=\r\nest. \n\n\n\n\n&gt;   - When it does become possible to record the outgoing\n&gt;     a=\r\nuth/form info, there may be reasons that it should\n&gt;     be left out (or di=\r\nrected to a file separate from the\n&gt;     main archives) -- for example if i=\r\nt utilizes login\n&gt;     info which must be kept secret. In some cases,\n&gt;    =\r\n leakage of such secret info may be very difficult\n&gt;     to prevent, if the=\r\n website echoes back login info\n&gt;     in plaintext-equivalent forms in cook=\r\nies or hidden\n&gt;     form variables.\n\n&gt; - Gordon\n\n\n"}}
