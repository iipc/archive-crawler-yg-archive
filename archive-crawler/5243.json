Bet I stress it more than most.  I have five \nbroad crawlers\nthat are still running, from a November 2007 start.    A billion here, a \nbillion there . . .\n(Soon, yer a government)\n\nI also applaud the trap taxonomy.  Yes, its useful, with a lot of room \nfor development.\n\nWe likely need to develop a good syntax for all the behaviors,\ne.g.\nslow site.\nnever ending site.\nintentional trap.\noperator threatens to sue you if you crawl them, but has no robots.txt \n(The ID ten T trouble ticket certainly applies here)\nad farm site.\ncalendar broken site.  ( I love these ones.  Seem to be at a lot of \nuniversities.   Its always good to\nknow the faculty will still be having a meeting on advanced research on \nMarch 25, 2087)\n\nWe could certainly continue the 200, 300, 400, . . . numbering code on \nthem, for example.\nMuch to think about, I won&#39;t write more here.\n\nJohn\n\nGordon Mohr wrote:\n\n&gt; We&#39;re trying something new next week -- an open-to-all conference call\n&gt; to improve communication among the Heritrix-using web harvesting \n&gt; community.\n&gt;\n&gt; If all goes well, other calls will follow -- after each major Heritrix\n&gt; release, and perhaps more often. We will also work to have calls in\n&gt; pairs, so that there are times convenient for both European and Pacific\n&gt; timezones.\n&gt;\n&gt; The first call will occur via a &#39;Skypecast&#39;, at the following time:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1500GMT Wednesday May 28th\n&gt; (8a San Francisco / 11a WashingtonDC / 4p London)\n&gt;\n&gt; The call will open with a brief overview of what&#39;s new in the latest\n&gt; Heritrix releases (1.14.0 and 2.0.0), and some of the priorities for\n&gt; future releases. Then, it will be an open discussion of whatever\n&gt; participants want to talk about.\n&gt;\n&gt; Participating in the Skypecast only requires a current version of Skype\n&gt; to participate, and accommodates up to 100 participants (with facilities\n&gt; for the moderator to rotate people into speaking positions).\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyone using or interested in web harvesting with Heritrix is welcome\n&gt; to participate. Latest info, including a link to the Skypecast page\n&gt; which allows joining the call, will live at this Heritrix wiki page:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Community+Calls \n&gt; &lt;http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Community+Calls&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Join us!\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
