The two tools used in concert provide \nfull-text search of small web archive collections and an Internet \nArchive Wayback-like means of browsing archive collection resources \nacross time.\n\nNutchWAX is hosted at sourceforge: \nhttp://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/nutch/.  Instructions on \nhow to obtain and setup NutchWAX and WERA can be found at the NutchWAX \nsite.  This site also has pointers to the sourceforge mailing list to \nuse discussing the NutchWAX+WERA tools and issue tracking databases for \nbugs and enhancement requests.  All commentary and feedback is welcomed.\n\nBoth NutchWAX and WERA should be considered alpha-grade software (See \nthe Bug and RFE list for a listing of known issues).\n\n(Check the NutchWAX site next week for a pointer to a demonstration of \nWERA+NutchWAX working together.)\n\nYours,\nSverre Bang and Michael Stack\n\n"}}
