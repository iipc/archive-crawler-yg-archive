(That&#39;s the current label of what&#39;s\n&gt; in \n&gt; SVN.) No official release will have such an odd middle number, though \n&gt; you can grab the auto-builds off our build box, or build yourself\n&gt; from \n&gt; source locally, if you&#39;re adventurous.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.14.1 is the most recent official release on the 1.X codeline.\n&gt; \n&gt; There haven&#39;t been any substantive changes to the 1.X codeline since \n&gt; that release, which was less than a month ago. All updates to robots \n&gt; handling were in 1.14.1, as you can see from the changelog:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel\n&gt; \n&gt; I suggest sticking with the official release unless you&#39;re sure\n&gt; you&#39;ve \n&gt; seen something you need get committed to SVN.\n&gt; \n&gt; Javadocs on the website are rebuilt and uploaded on each auto-build,\n&gt; so \n&gt; reflect the SVN version number.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; Matt Kent wrote:\n&gt; &gt; It seems that Heritrix 1.14.1 is the most recent release. The\n&gt; Javadoc\n&gt; &gt; claims it represents version 1.15.2, but I can find no evidence of\n&gt; said\n&gt; &gt; version in SVN or Jira. Does a tag of Heritrix 1.15.2 exist\n&gt; anywhere?\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m interested in the updates to the robots.txt stuff.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Matt\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
