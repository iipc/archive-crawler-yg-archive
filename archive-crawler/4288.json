It started as an experimental branch before we  \ndecided to make that branch 2.0.\n\nThe pjack_settings branch will be moved to trunk in a matter of  \nweeks. Until then, the branch should be stable, but not entirely  \nfunctional. The pjack_settings branch does build using maven 2.0.\n\n-Paul\n\nOn Jun 6, 2007, at 3:59 PM, Andrew Serff wrote:\n\n&gt; This may be a dumb question but I can&#39;t seem to find an answer  \n&gt; anywhere.\n&gt; There is mention of work being started on heritrix 2.0 on the wiki.  \n&gt; I&#39;m\n&gt; just getting started with heritrix and want to be using the latest and\n&gt; greatest. When I checkout and build from svn, it says it is still like\n&gt; 1.13.x. I also saw mention that you are moving from maven 1.x to 2.x\n&gt; and the trunk of svn (heritrix) still only builds with maven 1.x. Am I\n&gt; looking in the wrong place? let me know!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
