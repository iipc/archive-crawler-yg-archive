I have used \n1.2.0 but found the OOM errors to be a bit of a roadblock.  So, I \nhave downloaded and compiled 1.3.0 and am using the bdb.  This seems \nto have eliminated my oom errors, but performance is very poor.\n\nI have loaded up 75,000 seeds into my seed list (after setting up \nthe job but before running it).  The box is a dual 3.06 P4 w/ 2 GB \nof ram.  I have tested this on SUSE Ent 9 and RHES 3.0 w/ java 1.4.  \nI seem to be crawling about 5-10 pages per second w/ 100 threads.  \nWhat&#39;s wierd though is that my CPU and disk are not maxed out.  It \nlooks like there&#39;s plenty of resources to spare, but I can&#39;t get it \nto crawl faster.  Decreasing or increasing the threads makes it \nworse.  There is plenty of bandwidth available too.\n\nAnyway, I noticed that most of the threads are sitting in the \npostselector in a ABOUT_TO_BEGIN_PROCESSOR state.  Is this normal?  \nIs this my bottleneck?\n\nAny help and/or advice would be great.\n\nThanks,\nGreg\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
