I am unable to step through the actual\n&gt; crawl process.. \n&gt; 2)Tried to debug the main method of the\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.Heritrix.java ... the debugger ends its session at\n&gt; the end of the main method ( since the main thread starts\n&gt; sleeping).subsequent actions on the webui does&#39;nt get followed...\n&gt; \n&gt; Can somebody  help me with this problem and also wondering what is the\n&gt; best way to understand the program flow....(besidees the developer and\n&gt; user manuals) \n\nHeritrix developers use step debugging in Eclipse all the time, in \n1.14.x and 2.x, so it&#39;s definitely possible.\n\nWhen I launch from Eclipse for debugging, for Heritrix 1.14.x, my \ncommand-line options include as a VM option &quot;-Dheritrix.development&quot;, \nsetting a system property that prevents Heritrix from redirecting \nSTDOUT/STDERR to a log file and changes slightly how configuration info \nis found.\n\nWhen I launch from Eclipse for debugging, for Heritrix 2.x, my \ncommand-line options to the Heritrix class include &quot;-w \nwebui/src/main/webapp&quot; to point to my IDE_compiled classes for the webui \n(rather than the default WAR).\n\nIn either case, because Heritrix uses a pool of worker threads to handle \neach URI in turn, and crawls are typically launched/controlled via short \ntransaction in webui webserver threads or other short-lived \nspecial-purpose threads, attempting to step through activity from the \nmain() thread will not be helpful. Instead, I would add breakpoints at \nother key methods to catch and observe operations of interest.\n\nTo summarize, for your purposes, I would recommend:\n\n- As a newbie, start with Heritrix 1.14.x -- for now it&#39;s better for \ngetting started. (Though, you can still use 2.x if you want.)\n- Use Eclipse -- I expect NetBeans would work but I&#39;m sure Eclipse will, \nand the source from project SVN is already arranged as an Eclipse project\n- Set breakpoints rather than trying to step from the main() launch\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
