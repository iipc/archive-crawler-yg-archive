See my\ncomments at:\n\n  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1180683&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\nScopes based on chains of DecidingRules can probably meet this need\nbest: a late rule that REJECTs any URI whose last hop-type is an embed\nwould mostly do the job. (The fact that some &#39;E&#39;mbeds are frame HTML\ncontents could still be an issue; we may need a new &#39;F&#39; hop-type.)\n\n- Gordon\n\nKristinn Sigurdsson wrote:\n&gt; &quot;If enabled, embeded links (images etc.) are tested against scope&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Reading that I figured that this means that if disabled then embedded links\n&gt; will be scheduled unconditionally (although if recheck of scope is enabled\n&gt; in the Preselecter they may be discarded there!)\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, when I reviewed the code I discovered that, yes, if &#39;true&#39; then\n&gt; embedded links are treated normally, but if &#39;false&#39; embedded links all have\n&gt; the scheduling directive set to DONT_SCHEDULE which I take to mean that it\n&gt; will never be crawled. However, I can find no evidence that the directive is\n&gt; supported by the Frontiers which may lead to some interesting side effects\n&gt; since the value of the directive is -1 and generally a lower directive value\n&gt; is assumed to mean higher priority. I would suggest that the boys at the\n&gt; Archive take a second, much closer, look at this.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I would further suggest that if we wish to mark URIs as &#39;unschedulable&#39;,\n&gt; this not be done via the scheduling directive, or at the very least uses a\n&gt; value that is higher then NORMAL since most calculations about scheduling\n&gt; directives involves simple greater then or less then comparisons of the\n&gt; integers! (In fact preconditions are (were?) assigned their parent&#39;s\n&gt; scheduling directive minus one.) Perhaps the entire scheduling directive\n&gt; needs a closer look.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I would also suggest that there is generally no need for unconditionally\n&gt; passing embedded URIs through the scope (if that was ever the intention)\n&gt; since that only muddies up where the scope determination is performed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt;  \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; [mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Bjarne Andersen\n&gt; Sent: 16. j�n� 2005 09:50\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [archive-crawler] LinkScoper\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; What exactly does &#39;scope-embedded-links&#39; in the LinkScoper do ?\n&gt; \n&gt; best\n\n"}}
