Notably, the \nWARCWriter.writeMetadataRecord() method assumes it will write a set of \n&#39;ANVLRecord&#39; fields (an internal class representing a simple fielded set \nof metadata) rather than any of the other arbitrary kinds of metadata \nthat would also be legal by the WARC spec.\n\nAre you calling the &quot;new WARCWriter()&quot; code each time, or reusing one \n&#39;writer&#39; instance for each call to writeMetadataRecord()? (The \ninstantiation of a new WARCWriter always starts a new file, never \nappending to an existing file.)\n\nIf you are already reusing a single &#39;writer&#39; properly, perhaps something \nelse about your use pattern is triggering the automatic rollover to a \nnew file that usually happens only when the max-size is exceeded. I \nwould set a breakpoint or other debugging output at WARCWriter&#39;s \ncreateFile method(s), and see what is triggering a new file rather than \nthe reuse of the first file.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 4/1/11 5:31 AM, virginie wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to write many mets.xml file in one WARC File, but without success.\n&gt; At the moment when I write with\n&gt; WARCWriter writer = new WARCWriter (aint,dirs,prefix, suffix,compressed,WARCReader.DEFAULT_MAX_WARC_FILE_SIZE,metadata);\n&gt; And later\n&gt; writer.writeMetadataRecord(.-------)\n&gt; I receive per mets.xml file one WARC file but I would like to store all the mets.xml in the one whole WARC-File.\n&gt; Any idea why?\n&gt; How can I do it?\n&gt; Cheers\n&gt; Virginie\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
