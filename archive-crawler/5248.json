I&#39;m using reg=\r\nular\nexpression rules based on suggestions from previous posting. I would\nl=\r\nike to filter out everything except for text/xml and application/xml\nfiles.=\r\n The filters are applied on the scope, midfetch, and the arc\nwriter process=\r\nor. \nSo far everything works ok, except it still dowloads some text/html\nfi=\r\nles even though html is part of the rejection regexp in the scope.\nTurns ou=\r\nt all of the text/html downloads are dynamic URLs like this, \nhttp://somewe=\r\nbpage/subdir/?C=3DD;O=3DA \nMy question then is how do I prevent these text/=\r\nhtml from being\nwritten into the arc file. Thanks!\n\nShawn\n\n\n"}}
