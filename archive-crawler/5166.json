I&#39;d be happy to give=\r\n\na hand.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;d be very excited to integrate this code!\n&gt; \n&gt; Does it requir=\r\ne changes to core classes, or is it largely\nself-contained \n&gt; in its own ne=\r\nw classes? (Especially with regard to the Frontier -- \n&gt; because any change=\r\ns there would require a little more work to bring to \n&gt; the 2.x trunk.)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; We would probably plan another release as 1.14.x (or even \n&gt; previously-u=\r\nnplanned 1.16.0) to have an official 1.x release with\nsuch a \n&gt; interesting=\r\n contribution, even before trying to bring such code into\n2.x.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordo=\r\nn @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; Goel, Ankur wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt; &gt;             We have our ow=\r\nn implementation of the crawl farm based on\n&gt; &gt; top of Heritrix 1.6. We mov=\r\ned to version 1.13 sometime back.\n&gt; &gt; As a part of our work we have extende=\r\nd the heritrix code and\nimplemented\n&gt; &gt; a consistent hashing scheme for mai=\r\nntaining politeness\n&gt; &gt; and consistent distribution. We would like to contr=\r\nibute some of our\n&gt; &gt; distribution related code to the heritrix community.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Let me give a brief idea of what we have done that we would like =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; contribute. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 1. Each crawl node (called crawl engine in he=\r\nritrix 2.0)  is\nresponsible\n&gt; &gt; for figuring out if it should crawl the rec=\r\nieved/extracted URLs \n&gt; &gt; or the right crawler node that should be crawling=\r\n it and\ndispatches the\n&gt; &gt; URLs over JMX to the appropriate node. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 2. The crawl node uses the services of a &#39;DynamicCrawlMapper&#39; to take\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n care of distribution. This is a regular heritrix &#39;Processor&#39;\nintegrated\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; into heritrix processing chain.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3. The &#39;DynamicCrawlMapper&#39; use=\r\ns the services of a &#39;Distributor&#39; that\n&gt; &gt; talks to different crawl nodes o=\r\nver JMX and uses consistent hashing \n&gt; &gt; scheme to figure the destination n=\r\node for the URL. If the URL&#39;s hash\n&gt; &gt; falls in the bucket of the local nod=\r\ne then it is scheduled directly\n&gt; &gt; into the local heritrix instance.\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 4. The &#39;Distributor&#39; caches the info for all other crawl nodes. So in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; this environment every crawl node is agnostic of every other crawl\nnode=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If the community thinks this could bring value then we can work=\r\n\ntowards\n&gt; &gt; scrubbing out our custom code and get all licensing/legal issu=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; sorted out to get the code into heritrix.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; -Ank=\r\nur\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
