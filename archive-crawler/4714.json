A couple more questions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. In Hertrix 2.x i s there a plan to use Java NIO  (asynchronous I/O)\n&gt; in Toe-Threads to improve the performance and scalability\n&gt; of Heritrix for very large web crawls ?\n\nNo current plan. The bulk of our IO is done via the Apache Commons \nHTTPClient library, version 3.1, which does not have an NIO option. \nApparently there may be an NIO option in the following \nHttpCore/HttpComponents (HttpClient successor) version, but moving to \nthat version is also currently unplanned.\n\nAlso, the impression I have from other reports is that NIO benefits are \nminor, and come with some new problems, except in very narrow \nsituations. I suspect much greater performance benefits could be \nachieved with other optimizations, first.\n\n&gt; 2. How is politeness taken care of in Heritrix cluster configuration ?\n&gt;    Since 2 or more nodes in the cluster could be hitting the same server\n&gt;    without knowing that they are potentially violating politenss.\n\nWhenever we run crawls split over multiple machines, we use a \nCrawlMapper processor to ensure (with a few small exceptions) that any \nhostname is only hit by a single machine.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
