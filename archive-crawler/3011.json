This \n=\r\ninformation is written down in the crawl.log if I set the \nattribute &#39;sourc=\r\ne-tag-seeds&#39; in the frontier. But it will be more \nintersting to if the see=\r\nd is marked as an HTTP header and survives all \nthe way down to the arc rec=\r\nord. After reading the code, I thought that \nthe HTTP fetcher is a good pla=\r\nce to inject some HTTP headers into the \nHTTP response but I cannot see whe=\r\nre in code I can do that.\nAnybody can give me some advice in how I can add =\r\nmore headers to the \nHTTP response so that I can recover them in the arc fi=\r\nle?\n\nThanks in advance\nBarabasy  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
