I noticed that the seeds\nattribute description sa=\r\nys &quot;Initial seed(s)&quot;. I have tried ways of\nentering multiple seeds through =\r\njconsole, and none have worked. I have\ntried separating the URLs with space=\r\n, typing the newline escape char\n&#92;n, typing the enter key (which just activ=\r\nated the action). Is there a\nlimitation with jconsole&#39;s UI that makes it im=\r\npossible to submit\nmultiple seeds with a new job? i.e. Could i connect to H=\r\neritrix with\nJMX from my own app and pass a java string like\n&quot;http://www.do=\r\nmain1.com&#92;nhttp://www.domain2.com&#92;n ... &quot; as the seed?\n\nStarting new instan=\r\nces:\nThere is a button labeled start() in jconsole for Heritrix and has a\nd=\r\nescription of &quot;Start Heritrix instance&quot;. I have clicked this button\nexpecti=\r\nng a new instance of Heritrix to be started, but nothing\nhappens. Does this=\r\n button do something else, or am I not using it\nright? I have started Herit=\r\nrix on the command line. What steps have to\nbe taken to make the start() me=\r\nthod actually start a new instance of\nHeritrix through JMX?\n\nThank you much=\r\n,\nbadswalu\n\n\n"}}
