Do you guys planning to leave compatibil=\r\nity with java\n&gt; &gt; 1.4.2 and heading towards 5.0 ?  In the code, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; l=\r\nine 104 from org.archive.crawler.processor.FilePrintWriter from\n&gt; &gt; Crawler=\r\nMapper.java\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and line 111 from org.archive.crawler.util.SetBasedUri=\r\nUniqFilter\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you guys are using new PrintWriter(File file) construct=\r\nor which I\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t think it is supported in 1.4.2.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://java.s=\r\nun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html\n&gt; &gt; and only supported =\r\nin 5.0 \n&gt; &gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.htm=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since ppl like us still in love with FreeBSD and wants to stay =\r\nwith\n&gt; &gt; 1.4.2 will have some trouble getting the update without updating t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; code (not that it is a big deal).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, I just wanted to kn=\r\now which direction we are going, so that I\n&gt; &gt; can alert my admin getting r=\r\neady to move to java 5.0 if needed :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the wonderful sof=\r\ntware and support.
