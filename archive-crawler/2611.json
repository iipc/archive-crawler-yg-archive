When I criate a simple\n&gt; job, consisting with one or more seeds from the same domain (eg:\n&gt; http://www.zzz.com.br/ and http://www.zzz.com.br/aaa), and create an\n&gt; exclude filter with the URIRegExpFilter, the URI&#39;s that are covered by\n&gt; the regular expression has not been crawled... It&#39;s perfect! \n&gt; \n&gt; But, when I create a job (or a profile), with an override for the\n&gt; domain of the seed (http://www.zzz.com.br, in my example), and use the\n&gt; same filter of the single job, it has not been applied. The URI&#39;s that\n&gt; I don&#39;t want, are beeing captured. \n&gt; \n&gt; Anybody has an idea of what is happening?\n\nOne idea of something to check: is the override set up as intended?\n\nI believe stray space/dot characters can lead to confusion, as can\nthe way overrides are hierarchically organized in reverse-order of\nhostname parts. That is, inside the (possibly empty) &#39;br&#39; override,\nis a (possibly empty) &#39;com.br&#39; override, which has inside it a\n(possibly empty) &#39;zzz.com.br&#39; override, which has inside it the\n&#39;www.zzz.com.br&#39; override.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
