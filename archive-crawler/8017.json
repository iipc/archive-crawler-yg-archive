Particularly, the number of active threads is very\n&gt; low. Out of the 50 threads, only 1-5 are active. How does this\n&gt; happen? Why are there so many idle threads?\n\nUsually this is because all the fast/easy sites have been completed -- \nleaving only a handful of sites to collect, which happen to be \nlargest/slowest (or completely unresponxive).\n\nAs a matter of polite/responsible crawling, Hertirix only makes one \nrequest to a site at a time, waits a little longer between requests when \na site&#39;s responses are slow, and waits a lot longer (15 minutes) between \nretries when a site isn&#39;t responding at all. (That&#39;s to give time for \npossibly-temporary remote network/server issues to resolve, without \nusing up all the limited-count of retries.)\n\nMore discussion at:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/unexpectedly+slow+crawling+on+idle+crawler\n\nOftentimes the URLs left to crawl (the last X%) are all non-responsive, \nand so rather than waiting for all the slow-retries to finish all their \nfailed attempts, a crawl operator will just decide to manually terminate \nthe crawl.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
