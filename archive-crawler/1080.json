Thanks for \npointing it out.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the meantime you can use the PDF version which is available at \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.pdf\n&gt; It&#39;s not quite as pretty, but has the same content. However I don&#39;t \n&gt; think you will find what you are looking for there. As I recall the \n&gt; ContextTypeRegExp is a fairly recent (and advanced) addition and is \n&gt; simply outside the manual&#39;s scope. Maybe Michael (or someone) will \n&gt; amend that as well :)\n\nYeah, its a new feature as Kris says.  Here&#39;s the little note on it from \nthe user manual:\n\n&quot;This filter runs a regular expression against the response \n&lt;literal&gt;Content-Type&lt;/literal&gt; header. Returns true if content type  \nmatches the regular expression.  ContentType regexp filter cannot be \nused until after fetcher processors have run.  Only then is the \nContent-Type of the response known. A good place for this filter is the \nwriter step in processing.  See &lt;xref linkend=&quot;regexpr&quot; /&gt; for more \nabout regular expressions in Heritrix.&quot;\n\nYet a newer related feature is the running of filters after receipt of \nthe response headers but before we start the download of the response \ncontent.  A little note on this facility is in the FetchHTTP section:\n\n&quot;Its also possible to add in filters that are checked after the download \nof the HTTP response headers but before the response content is read.  \nUse &lt;literal&gt;midfetch-filters&lt;/literal&gt; to abort the download of \ncontent-types other than those wanted (Aborted fetches have an \nannotation &lt;literal&gt;midFetchAbort&lt;/literal&gt; appended to the \n&lt;literal&gt;crawl.log&lt;/literal&gt; entry).  Note that unless the same filters \nare applied at the writer processing step, the response headers -- but \nnot the content -- will show in ARC files.&quot;\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;     -----Original Message-----\n&gt;     *From:* robeger [mailto:reger@...]\n&gt;     *Sent:* 13. oktï¿½ber 2004 15:06\n&gt;     *To:* archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     *Subject:* [archive-crawler] user manual?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     The link on the main heritrix page\n&gt;     (http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html)\n&gt;     &lt;http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html%29&gt; just\n&gt;     brings up\n&gt;     a blank page.\n&gt;\n&gt;     I was hoping to find some documentation on the ContextTypeRegExp\n&gt;     filtering.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Rob.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     *Yahoo!
