If so it=\r\n returns true, \n&gt; otherwise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it returns false.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A filter c=\r\nould be used in several places in the crawler. Most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; notably is the us=\r\ne of filters in the Scope. Aside that, filters \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also used in pr=\r\nocessors. Filters applied to processors always \n&gt; filter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; URIs out. Th=\r\nat is to say that any URI matching a filter on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; processor will effec=\r\ntively skip over that processor. This can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useful to disable (for i=\r\nnstance) link extraction on documents \n&gt; coming\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;from a specific sec=\r\ntion of a given website.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All Filters should subclass the Filte=\r\nr class. Creating a filter \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just a matter of implementing the in=\r\nnerAccepts(Object) method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because of the planned overhaul of the sco=\r\npes and filters, we \n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not provide a extensive example of how to=\r\n create a filter at this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point. It should be pretty easy though to fo=\r\nllow the directions \n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the javadoc. For your filter to show in the=\r\n application \n&gt; interface,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you&#39;ll need to edit src/conf/modules/Filte=\r\nr.options\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have wr=\r\nited a filter class,but i have not know how to apply it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody can=\r\n tell me ? Thank you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
