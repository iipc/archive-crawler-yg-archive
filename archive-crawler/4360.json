Looking at addCrawllJob seeds treatment, it looks \nlike the seeds argument is actually dropped on certain code paths down \nthrough the addCrawlJob overrides (e.g. \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#1349).\n\nHere is code for &#39;start&#39;: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#1889.  \nIt puts an heritrix instance into a &#39;ready&#39; mode such that if you give \nthe instance a job, it&#39;ll start crawling it.  Clicking it, you should \nsee a change in the Heritrix instance status message.\n\nCreating a new instance is something else altogether.  You need to \ninvoke an heritrix constructor.  I do not remember if this is possible \nfrom jconsole.  It is possible using the jmxclient-commandline tool: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/cmdline-jmxclient/.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\nbadswalu wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I was looking at a running instance of Heritrix with jconsole and\n&gt; playing around with the controls and had a few questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Adding new jobs:\n&gt; When adding a job using the &quot;addJob&quot; or &quot;addJobBasedOn&quot; openMBeans, is\n&gt; it possible to add more than one URL? I noticed that the seeds\n&gt; attribute description says &quot;Initial seed(s)&quot;. I have tried ways of\n&gt; entering multiple seeds through jconsole, and none have worked. I have\n&gt; tried separating the URLs with space, typing the newline escape char\n&gt; &#92;n, typing the enter key (which just activated the action). Is there a\n&gt; limitation with jconsole&#39;s UI that makes it impossible to submit\n&gt; multiple seeds with a new job? i.e. Could i connect to Heritrix with\n&gt; JMX from my own app and pass a java string like\n&gt; &quot;http://www.domain1.com \n&gt; &lt;http://www.domain1.com&gt;&#92;nhttp://www.domain2.com \n&gt; &lt;nhttp://www.domain2.com&gt;&#92;n ... &quot; as the seed?\n&gt;\n&gt; Starting new instances:\n&gt; There is a button labeled start() in jconsole for Heritrix and has a\n&gt; description of &quot;Start Heritrix instance&quot;. I have clicked this button\n&gt; expecting a new instance of Heritrix to be started, but nothing\n&gt; happens. Does this button do something else, or am I not using it\n&gt; right? I have started Heritrix on the command line. What steps have to\n&gt; be taken to make the start() method actually start a new instance of\n&gt; Heritrix through JMX?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you much,\n&gt; badswalu\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
