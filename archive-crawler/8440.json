So, the rule \noften saves the crawler from endless crawloing of meaningless/repetitive \ncontent. But, all the default rules are just based on fuzzy guesswork \nabout what&#39;s most often useful, and specific sites (like yours) may \ndeviate. (The default maxPathHops of 20 is a similar fuzzy heuristic: \nit&#39;s rare for valuable URIs to have more than 20 path-segments... but \nsome sites might, and in such cases, you&#39;d want to change your settings.)\n\nYour options would be to either remove the PathologicalPathDecideRule, \nor allow more than 2 repeated path-segments before treating a URI as \ndeserving a REJECT decision. Of course, that would increase the risk \nyour crawl follows certain trap paths, so you&#39;d want to watch your logs \nand run-times for that.\n\nIf, after suspecting the scope, it wasn&#39;t immediately clear what rule \nwas to blame, then the next debugging step would usually be to study the \neffects of each rule in sequence, as each discovered URI was considered. \nAs a developer, and once knowing exactly what source page is implicated, \nI&#39;d often do this inside a debugger, stepping through the code as each \nsource URI outlink was evaluated. But another option is the suggestion \nthat Noah made on Dec-11 in response to your question about &quot;best \nmax-hop count&quot; - you can force a DecideRuleSequence to &#39;logToFile&#39; scope \ndecisions, which can help identify which rules aren&#39;t behaving as you \nexpect.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
