We have some existing interefaces \nthat I am pretty sure we are going to want to keep, because they are \nvery simple. \n\nThe Heritrix interface is very nice, and I can seeing making use of \nit as well, but it does require a fairly sophisticated user. \n\nI would be interested to know if there is a way to run heritrix as a \nservice rather than as an applicaiton.\n\nThanks!\n\nJay\n\n\n\n"}}
