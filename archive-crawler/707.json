My top reportage on mem. usage and whats showing \n&gt; in the UI seem to correlate.  Are you sure its the heritrix app that \n&gt; showing using 28.8% of the heap?  The PIDs line up?  Which linux?  \n&gt; Kernel?  VM?\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n\nI am using bin/heritrix and still getting  65088 KB max heap size in\nthe console. Started a crawl job and top shows 16.1 in %MEM column.\nAll java pids line up. There are 50 of those java running I guess! 1\nfor each toe thread? before starting the heritrix I did a ps -aef |\ngrep java to see if there is any java running, there was none. I am\nrunning Gentoo linux, 2.6.7 kernel, sun-jdk-1.4.2.04. Any clue? \n\n-Nachi\n\n\n"}}
