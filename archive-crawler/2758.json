I have made some tests, and I could creat=\r\ne\nother Heritrix instances with the GUI admin, in the url\nhttp://localhost:=\r\n8080/local-instances.jsp, and I could access those\nnew instances with jcons=\r\nole. What I could not find, is how to create\nthose with jconsole, is there =\r\na way to do that?\n\nThanks very much, \n\ntizo\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; tizo_trico wrote:\n&gt; &gt; St.Ac=\r\nk,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, Yan Zhang&#39;s suggestion works; I already have been working i=\r\nn that\n&gt; &gt; way, but I wonderer  if that could be done automatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhat would you suggest?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have also thought in make a Java program t=\r\nhat controls Heritrix via\n&gt; &gt; JMX, and creates jobs &quot;based on existing jobs=\r\n&quot;, as soon as they\n&gt; &gt; finished, but what about the seeds?, how can I recov=\r\ner the same seeds?\n&gt; I may be misinterpreting your question.  Are you askin=\r\ng how to reuse\nthe \n&gt; same seeds in every job?  If so, as part of creating =\r\na job, you specify \n&gt; the seeds to use usually by having the order.xml poin=\r\nt to a seeds.txt \n&gt; file, the very file that was used in all previous crawl=\r\ns.  With JMX you \n&gt; can pass paths to the order and seed file to use or pas=\r\ns seeds as a \n&gt; string or pass a jar file that has the order and seeds as w=\r\nell as any \n&gt; settings overrides (The latter makes it easier posting jobs t=\r\no a remote \n&gt; Heritrix instance).\n&gt; &gt; Should the program itself control the=\r\n seeds for each &quot;reusable&quot; job?\n&gt; &gt; or there is a simpler way?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyw=\r\nay, when you say &quot;Automated rescheduling of jobs is not part of\n&gt; &gt; the cra=\r\nwler.&quot;, is because it should not be part of the crawler? \n&gt; Thats what I th=\r\nink.  Keeps things modular and our options open.  \n&gt; Scheduler can then be =\r\nas simple as a cron job invoking heritrix \n&gt; command-line arguments or as s=\r\nophisticated as quartz \n&gt; (http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/) invoking He=\r\nritrix via JMX as \n&gt; originally suggested up on this list a while back \n&gt; (=\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1827).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncould it be a new functionality for future releases? It the last was\n&gt; &gt; tr=\r\nue, maybe I could work on that, but I don&#39;t know yet, because we are\n&gt; &gt; st=\r\nudying the best way to implement the reusability of jobs, and one of\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne alternatives is modifying Heritrix code.\n&gt; For sure it could be part of a=\r\n future Heritrix and we&#39;d welcome any \n&gt; scheduling contribution.\n&gt; \n&gt; For =\r\nour archive-it service we have a basic scheduler that lets you\nstart \n&gt; a j=\r\nob at defined coarse intervals (Once a day, once a week, etc.). \nThis \n&gt; &#39;s=\r\ncheduling&#39; is built into the application that manages all of the \n&gt; Hertric=\r\ne instances each running distinct crawl jobs.  It does this via \n&gt; the hcc =\r\nHeritrix subproject: http://crawler.archive.org/hcc/ (hcc is \n&gt; beginnings =\r\nof a &#39;Heritrix Cluster Controller&#39;, an application that can \n&gt; give a view =\r\nonto a cluster of Heritrix crawlers).  If hcc had a\nbuilt-in \n&gt; scheduler, =\r\nour archive-it would likely use it. If it was part of\nhcc, so \n&gt; could othe=\r\nrs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself, I don&#39;t see much value in adding a scheduler to Heritrix\ni=\r\ntself: \n&gt; Another heavy jar, multiple specification screens if the schedule=\r\nr\nis of \n&gt; any sophistication at all, and a new place on disk to worry abou=\r\nt  for \n&gt; persisted schedules.  I&#39;d be more interested in an external sched=\r\nuler \n&gt; that is able to schedule multiple instances being part of a separat=\r\ne \n&gt; cluster-management application but perhaps others see value in buildin=\r\ng \n&gt; scheduling into Heritrix itself?\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks very mu=\r\nch,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; tizo\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Mi=\r\nchael Stack &lt;stack@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tizo_trico wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi there,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any way to reuse a job after it has finished?
