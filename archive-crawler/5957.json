But today, it is around 0.7. When I run a Java profiler to see what was wrong, I can see that most of the CPU time is spent within my custom processor&#39;s innerProcess(ProcessorURI) &gt; GenericReplayCharSequence.toString() &gt; StringBuffer.append(CharSequence) &gt; GenericReplayCharSequence.charAt(int) &gt; CharsetDecoder.decode(ByteBuffer)\n&gt; here is a screenshot from the profiler: http://files.getdropbox.com/u/1571029/profiler.jpg\n&gt; \n&gt; and here is how I use ReplayCharSequence in MySQLWriter.innerProcess(ProcessorURI uri) {\n&gt;  ReplayCharSequence cs = null;\n&gt;  try { \n&gt;    cs = uri.getRecorder().getReplayCharSequence();\n&gt;    String myString = cs.toString();\n&gt;    // some inner implementation\n&gt;  } finally {\n&gt;    //close cs.close(); //within try-catch and all\n&gt;  }\n&gt; }\n&gt; \n&gt; Am I missing something?\n&gt; Appreciate any help!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ikrom\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
