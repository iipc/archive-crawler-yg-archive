To\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nparticipate in discussion, I have some general type comments on it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Do all machines in a cluster use the same profile for a crawl? Each\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n machine may have different disk space/bandwidth/CPU so an identical\n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\nofile for everyone may not be practical. What about one\n&gt; &gt; `super&#39; profile=\r\n with some common options set so that each\n&gt; &gt; cluster member can adjust th=\r\ne performance related options. How many\n&gt; &gt; profiles should user write for =\r\na single distributed crawl?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I think there needs to be one config. sha=\r\nred by all members of the\n&gt; cluster.  Otherwise, if we allow config. to var=\r\ny by crawler, the cluster\n&gt; will fast become unmanageable.\n&gt; \n&gt; But as you =\r\npoint out, different hosts have different capacity.  Or, even\n&gt; if all craw=\r\nlers are exactly the same, they&#39;ll each have a different\n&gt; crawl experience=\r\n as the crawl progresses (As you say later in your\n&gt; mail).  Though I&#39;ve ju=\r\nst said that all crawler&#39;s should have the same\n&gt; config., it&#39;d be sweet if=\r\n there was a &#39;dial&#39; that we could turn\n&gt; remotely: the crawler&#39;s &#39;capacity&#39;=\r\n dial. We&#39;d aggregate a bunch of order\n&gt; file attributes under crawler &#39;cap=\r\nacity&#39;.  Increasing a crawler&#39;s\n&gt; capacity would ripple down through an ord=\r\ner file in a way yet to be\n&gt; figured changing attribute values up or down d=\r\nependent on which way the\n&gt; &#39;dial&#39; was turned making the crawler carry more=\r\n or less of the crawl\n&gt; scope.  This might be a little ambitious.  A more b=\r\nasic mechanism would\n&gt; increase or decrease the faction of the total crawl =\r\nscope a particular\n&gt; machine is responsible for somehow moving queues betwe=\r\nen crawlers when\n&gt; the the fraction is changed midcrawl.\n\nAnd why is it tha=\r\nt this dial mechanism couldn&#39;t be implemented\nregardless of the multimachin=\r\ne intentions?  I think that it would be a\ngreat feature for just plain Heri=\r\ntrix.  Certainly a simpler control\nfor someone who would like to try with m=\r\nost of the defaults and\ndoesn&#39;t want to get into the nitty gritty would be =\r\na fabulous addition\nto the GUI.  Also, combined with JMX, this could be a v=\r\nery interesting\nway of ramping up or down a crawl based on other machine fa=\r\nctors.\n\n-matt\n\n"}}
