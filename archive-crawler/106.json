More evidence that the first thing tested by a test \nplan is the test plan itself. \n\n&gt; crawl08.archive.org/documenttypes/example-background-image.jpeg \n&gt; This is linked on example-background-image.html, but heritrix is not \n&gt; finding the jpeg which is located in:\n&gt; &lt;body background=&quot;example-background-image.jpeg&quot;&gt;\n\nThis is a bug; we&#39;re not yet extracting &#39;background&#39; embeds. Please\nenter into bug db (if you haven&#39;t already) and I&#39;ll be able to fix \nit later today.\n\n&gt; http://crawl08.archive.org/documenttypes/binaries\n&gt; This is throwing a 403 error.\n\nIs this just listed in the manifest or also linked from test pages?\n\n&gt; And finally, if you specify a directory without the &quot;/&quot; at the end, it \n&gt; returns a 301 response (Moved Permanently) and then redirects to the &quot;/&quot;.  \n&gt; I don&#39;t know if this is a problem or not, but the manifest is \n&gt; reporting quite a few of those.\n\nIf Heritrix running-from-seeds, following-links gets the same \npattern of responses, that&#39;s fine. If on the other hand the \ntest page links already include the trailing &quot;/&quot;s, then the \nmanifest should include the trailing &quot;/&quot;s too. After all, 3XX\nresponses are archived/logged too.\n\nGood catches!\n\n- Gordon\n\n&gt; Judy\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, 16 Jul 2003, Parker Thompson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Judy,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a file called MANIFEST-20030716162217-0.arc.gz in the directory:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   /0/cvs_webcrawler_nightly_build/CrawlerTesting/Heritrix/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; on crawl08 that has the crawl of the manifest.  This should be useful for\n&gt; &gt; comparison, though I may be +/- a few links at this point.  If you could\n&gt; &gt; do the comparison when you have a chance that would be cool.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Oh, and I made a few changes to the garden, so perhaps this can be done\n&gt; &gt; after tomorrow morning&#39;s crawl so you get the freshest fresh.
