You can attach your html patch here - https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1726 and create new issues for anything else. Your contributions are most welcome.\n\nRe xml vs json, the initial choice of xml was essentially arbitrary. All else being equal, it would be nice to support json. We would likely add it to the repertoire rather than replace xml, though.\n\nNoah\n\n\nDaniel Truemper wrote:\n&gt;&gt; With the new version it seams that I cannot attach a DecideRule to the DIsposition chain, can I?\n&gt; Answering myself: you may override the &quot;shouldProcessRule&quot; property of any processor...\n&gt; \n&gt; The chain is not a processor but I only need this with the writer processor :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Another question: is there a dev list? If not: is the JIRA the preferred way of sending patches?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have mirrored the Heritrix3 directory from trunk on Github [1]. There is also an experimental branch where I replaced the Restlet 1 code with Restlet 2 and JSON answers. I also started with decoupling the HTML generation from the code. When the REST API answers JSON, the HTML pages may call the API as well. Plus: I think that JSON is more easy since I do not have to write XSD or something like that in order to get Java Objects. This should make writing clients more easy than with XML?!\n&gt; \n&gt; Any comments welcome!\n&gt; \n&gt; Daniel\n&gt; \n&gt; [1]: http://github.com/truemped/heritrix3\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
