The\n&gt; upshot is that if you try to create a new profile based on an existing\n&gt; one (though i&#39;m not sure where it is finding these), it fails,\n&gt; claiming that it cannot find seeds.txt.\n\nThe profiles and modules are built into the heritrix jar with a while \nnow. When heritrix goes looking for core files such as default profiles, \nit first checks the filesystem and if its unable to find needed files \nhere, it goes to the classpath.  The reason for moving core files on to \nthe classpath rather than leave them out on the filesystem is because in \nsome contexts, e.g. heritrix packaged as a WAR file, finding files and \ndirectories on disk gets tricky.\n\nI tried making a new profile with the last build from \ncrawltools.archive.org and it went fine for me.  Where do you get the \nfailed to find seeds.txt message? Is it when you try to create new \nprofile from an old profile?  Is the old profile one of the defaults or \none of your own making?\n\nThanks Tom,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &#39;maven distro&#39; succeeds without an error.
