My current idea is to have all 8 \n&gt; crawlers (total 8) download 1B pages in total. Assume ideal page \n&gt; distribution (this is why a CHF-based CrawlMapper is much better than \n&gt; the current alphabetical CrawlMapper), each crawler would be \n&gt; responsible for 125M URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s make sure we&#39;re not talking about &quot;queue&#39;ed&quot; URLs \n&gt; but &quot;downloaded&quot; URLs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please confirm.
