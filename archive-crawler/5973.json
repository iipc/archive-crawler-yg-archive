There&#39;s also a facility to JUMP \n(fast-forward, really) via this return value to another Processor by the \ntarget Processor&#39;s String key name, though that facility has seen so \nlittle use there might be issues with it.\n\nThe 2.0 precedence functionality offers a lot of control of URI/queue \nordering, but be careful of the performance costs of complicated \npolicies: in a large crawl, expressing very fine-grained preference of \nURI ordering means lots of essentially random-access queue inserts, and \nthen random-access disk seeks.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nsendaman69 wrote:\n&gt; Thanks Gordon, your answer helped me out on this one!\n&gt; \n&gt; The only reason I&#39;m tryin to use 2.0.2 is because it allows me to manipulate the precendence of the uris which I kinda need for my project.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any way to do this in 1.14.3?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think I would switch if there is..because there is defniatly more docs out there for 1.14.3\n&gt; \n&gt; ...and I&#39;m already runnning into the next problem...how can I skip to the post processors in 2.0.2? The method skiptoPrcessor() isn&#39;t implemented anymore in 2.0.2?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again,\n&gt; \n&gt; Georgie\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; The &#39;Key&#39; mechanism is for configurable settings, rather than dynamic \n&gt;&gt; state that varies for different URIs.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Instead use the getData() method of CrawlURI to get a \n&gt;&gt; HashMap&lt;String,Object&gt; into which you can store arbitrary state for \n&gt;&gt; later Processors.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (This data doesn&#39;t survive the URI being put back onto a queue -- for \n&gt;&gt; example if it needs to be retried after certain kinds of errors. For \n&gt;&gt; that, or for data that should be &#39;inherited&#39; by other URIs discovered \n&gt;&gt; via the current CrawlURI, look at the addPersistentDataMapKey() or \n&gt;&gt; makeHeritable() methods. If using either of these, make sure the extra \n&gt;&gt; state you add serializes/deserializes cleanly.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also, do you need particular features only present in Heritrix 2.0.2? If \n&gt;&gt; not, I recommend using 1.14.3; it is still better documented and more \n&gt;&gt; proven in production environments than the 2.0.x line.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In 1.14.3, the same general mechanisms exist but the implementing \n&gt;&gt; methods/classes are slightly different:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2.0.x                        1.14.3\n&gt;&gt; getData()                 -&gt; getAlist()\n&gt;&gt; addPersistentDataMapKey() -&gt; addAlistPersistentMember()\n&gt;&gt; makeHeritable()           -&gt; makeHeritable()\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; sendaman69 wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m computing a relevance score of each URI based on the HTML content of the URI in a processor and an external IE prorgam.
