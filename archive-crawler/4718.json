If I\ntry to uncompress using gunzip I get the &#39;unzip: recover.gz:\nunexpected end of file&#39; error.

(Is this from a crawl that crashed?)\n&gt;\n&gt;  Still, gunzip will uncompress what it can, so besides some small number\n&gt;  of lines missing at the end, its output can still be used. Generally,\n&gt;  the missing lines are not a problem -- a tiny number of URIs from that\n&gt;  range will be recrawled.\n&gt;\n&gt;  - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  mjjjhjemj wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Please Help!
