Our\nexperiments can be grouped into three phases:\n\nA: Semantic clustering experiments (classification, metatagging,\n   building category hierarchies).\nB: Combined search (web + OAI/digital library native)\nC: Federated framework (federated digital library services beyond OAI)\n\nWe are considering Heretrix chiefly for items in phase B.  Here we are\nstudying two approaches: combined search (and potentially other\nservices) via publishing digital library resources in OAI format to the\nweb, then unifying them with other crawled web resources and building\nthe search on top of this.  The second approach is to use a focused\ncrawl to discover salient digital library resources on the web, then use\nmetatagging (from phase A) to publish these resources to the digital\nlibrary, upon which services such as search can be built.  \n\nThe two approaches are basically the converse of each other.  What we\nare doing is studying the feasibility of them with open source software\nin particular.  \n\nThe better the crawler, the better the results we can get in phase B.  A\nfocused crawler is necessary to ensure subject relevance, as our test\nplatform and digital libraries in general tend to specialize.  Thus we\neagerly anticipate focusing capabilities in Heretrix.  We will of course\nbe happy to assist in any way that we can in getting Heretrix to the\npoint of filling this role in our project.\n\nBest,\n\nAaron Krowne\n\n-- \nAaron Krowne\nHead of Digital Library Research\nEmory University General Libraries \nOffice: 404-712-2810                                     \nCell: 404-405-5766\nakrowne@...  \n\n"}}
