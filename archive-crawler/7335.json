Most would have \nbeen comfortable using the Apache license, but there were some concerns \nat the time about GPL compatibility.\n\nThe LGPL 2.1 seemed to balance all concerns, being clearly usable in all \nkinds of other projects, Apache/GPL/commercial.\n\nSoon after, the Apache License 2.0 came out (January 2004). Over time, \nit became popular, especially in the world of Java projects/libraries. \nWith GPLv3 being finalized a few years later, the FSF blessed Apache \nLicense 2.0 as compatible with the GPLv3.\n\nMost of the libraries important for Heritrix are Apache-licensed, and \nother major projects of deep interest for our problem domain, such as \nLucene/SOLR and Hadoop, are all Apache-2.0-licensed. We&#39;d like there to \nbe no friction for using code between these projects... in particular if \nwe write something that makes more sense appearing in a more \nfoundational library, we want them to be able to take it. And finally, \nif Heritrix or other related web-archiving projects were ever to have an \nformal organizational home outside that of the Internet Archive or \nanother IIPC-member-like archiving institution, the Apache Software \nFoundation might be a candidate.\n\nFor these reasons, Heritrix wanted to move to the Apache 2.0 license at \nsome point, and in early 2008 the IIPC technical committee recommended \nthat the Apache 2.0 license be the default for future IIPC projects.\n\nSo, we started moving source files to Apache in the Heritrix 2.0 \ndevelopment cycle. In Heritrix 3.0, the third-party libraries used \nremain under a variety of licenses which allow our use/redistribution, \nbut our source is almost entirely Apache 2.0 licensed. (A few source \nfiles directly derived from source under other licenses retain those \noriginal licenses, and are marked as such.)\n\n&gt; Or could Heritrix 1 just as well have the same license as Heritrix 3\n\nAre you suggesting moving the Heritrix 1.X.Y codebase to the same Apache \nLicense 2.0 as Heritrix 3?\n\nMy hunch is that would be a lot of effort for little benefit. Any source \nyou might want to mix freely with an Apache project can probably already \nbe taken from the H3 codebase. Any embedded use of H1 can probably be \nachieved through its LGPL2.1 license.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; S�ren Vejrup Carlsen, Department of Digital Preservation, Royal Library,\n&gt; Copenhagen, Denmark\n&gt;\n&gt; tlf: (+45) 33 47 48 41\n&gt;\n&gt; email: svc@...\n&gt;\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Non omnia possumus omnes\n&gt;\n&gt; --- Macrobius, Saturnalia, VI, 1, 35 -------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
