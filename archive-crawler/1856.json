Then it would be nice (=essential) if the other PC is allowed \nto have a different operating system, Java installation etc.\n\n2)Running jobs offline with crontab and scripts where the scripts \ncould reside on Heritrix-box or any remote machine\n\nThe idea with filters seems to be that most of them are set before \nrunning a job. But I often add filters during crawls when using a set \nof seeds for the first time. So an easy way to add filters online to \nany remote controlled job is important!
