And I roughly measured \n&gt; the time to read the stream, it takes about 50s, so time-out occurs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I copy Heritrix to my PC at home, it access internet via adsl \n&gt; without proxy. It runs smoothly, no time-out occurs (sotimeout=20s).\n&gt; \n&gt; today, I did another test, replacing \n&gt; &quot;rec.getRecordedInput().readFullyOrUntil(..);&quot; in FetchHTTP.java\n&gt; with\n&gt; &quot;byte[] responseBody = method.getResponseBody();\n&gt;  System.out.println(new String(responseBody));&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; the updated sentences execute without time-out (sotimeout=20s). \n&gt; \n&gt; The new sentences will also read content from stream as the previous \n&gt; sentence, but it runs smoothly.  So, I think the problem I met, is \n&gt; partly related to my working environment(network or software \n&gt; setting?), and partly to Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you give me some suggestions to fix this problem.\n\nIs Heritrix doing anything else at this time?  How many other\nfetches/threads are running concurrently?  If only one thread, do you\nget the timeout?  \n\nRecordingInputStream#read records all read from the socket to a file.\n Maybe its this writing to a file that is taking a long time?  Try\ncommenting out the recording in RecordingInputStream#read or maybe add\nlogging of how long its taking to complete ... especially if its\ntaking seconds to write bytes:\n\n    public int read(byte[] b) throws IOException {\n    \t    if (!isOpen()) {\n    \t    \t    throw new IOException(&quot;Stream closed &quot; +\n    \t\t\t    Thread.currentThread().getName());\n    \t    }\n    \t    int count = this.in.read(b);\n-        if (count &gt; 0) {\n-            assert this.recordingOutputStream != null: &quot;ROS is null &quot; - +\n-                Thread.currentThread().getName();\n-            this.recordingOutputStream.write(b,0,count);\n-        }\n        return count;\n    }\n\nComment out the lines marked with &#39;-&#39; (this will break subsequent\nprocessing of the file) or perhaps rather add a:\n\nlong startTime = System.currentMillis();\n\nbefore the call to write with a logger.warn after the write that\nreports how long the write took.\n\nThis is an interesting issue.  It shouldn&#39;t be behaving this way.\nThanks for looking into this,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; thx\n\n\n\n\n"}}
