I managed to read the list of files \n&gt; contains in the ARC. I can read the html file as it is in plain text \n&gt; format but not with other format such as .jpg and .pdf.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do I extract the jpg and pdf file?\n&gt;\nWhy?  What happens?  Paste in the commands you are using.\n\nFor .pdf, I&#39;d imagine you&#39;d do something like:\n\n% ./bin/arcreader --offset=XXXXX --format=nohead| pdfviewer\n\nOr\n\n% ./bin/arcreader --offset=XXXX --format=nohead &gt; tmp.pdf\n\n... and then open tmp.pdf with your pdfviewer.\n \n(1.2 cmdline is slightly different).\n\n\n&gt; Notice that reading each record is slow. \n\nDo you mean arcfile rather than record in the above?  Yes, reading an\narcfile can be slow.  Reading a record is usually not too bad.\n\n&gt; Normally users will write \n&gt; java file using arcreader class to get all records in one time, am I \n&gt; right? Any other ways?\n&gt; \nYes. Usually. But tell us more of what you are trying to do.\n\nIf you want to get random records from arcs, you&#39;ll need to know the\noffsets in advance, so yes, you&#39;ll need to run through it first to\nfigure what these all are and keep these off in an &#39;index&#39; of some form.\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides that, I was just using the basic setting that run the test. \n&gt; Whenever there are file formats other than plain text. Do I need to \n&gt; explicitly specify any setting?\nPlease expand on your question.  I&#39;m a little unclear on what you&#39;re\nasking.  Are you referring to the ARCReader or to Heritrix?\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Inn Fang\n\n\n\n\n"}}
