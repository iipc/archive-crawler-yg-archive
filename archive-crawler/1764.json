It could mark URLs that are not of interest with an error code\nthat prevents further link-extraction or writing-to-disk (depending on where\nin the URL-processing you insert your extra Processor). For example,\nyour processor might do the following to a CrawlURI determined to be of\nno interest:\n\n\tcuri.setFetchStatus(FetchStatusCodes.S_OUT_OF_SCOPE);\n\n...meaning even though the URL was scheduled and/or partially processed, a\nlater check determined it was not of interest.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
