I just \n&gt;gave them the user manual link. Following the instructions in \n&gt;there they simply installed a JRE. However it won&#39;t run with \n&gt;just a JRE - the web interface needs a full JAVA to compile \n&gt;jsp pages:\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;HTTP ERROR: 500\n&gt;Unable+to+compile+class+for+JSP%0A%0AAn+error+occurred+at+line%3A+%2D1+in+th\n&gt;e+jsp+file%3A+null%0A%0AGenerated+servlet+error%3A%0A++++%5Bjavac%5D+Compili\n&gt;ng+1+source+file%0A%0A%0A\n&gt;\n&gt;RequestURI=/&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve just read the bit in the manual about installing Heritrix and \n&gt;it definately implies that only a JRE will do the job so I guess \n&gt;thats a documentation bug. I&#39;ll raise it as a bug but I&#39;ve only \n&gt;just woken up and before coffee bug forms are too scary ;-). I&#39;ll\n&gt;do it in a bit. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThats interesting Mark.  It works with full SDK?  Make a bug and I&#39;ll \nfix the manual.  This is 1.0.4?  Is it running the selftest when this \nhappens because the admin webapp is all precompiled.\nGood stuff,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;cheers \n&gt;\n&gt;mark \n&gt;\n&gt;**************************************************************************\n&gt;\n&gt;Experience the British Library online at www.bl.uk \n&gt;\n&gt;Help the British Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
