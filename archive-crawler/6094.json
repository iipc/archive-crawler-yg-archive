So it is only redundant to make xyz.com/a a seed if xyz.com links to xyz.com/a.\n\nA url is normally only crawled once, even if it is discovered more than once. Unless your crawl ran with some strange and unusual settings, your seeds do not explain why it might be larger than expected. Take a look at logs/crawl.log to see exactly what was crawled.\n\nNoah\n\n\nPranay Pandey wrote:\n&gt; I was wondering how heritrix handles sort of repeated seeds.\n&gt; My seed list has the following entries:\n&gt; \n&gt; xyz.com\n&gt; xyz.com/a\n&gt; xyz.com/b\n&gt; xyz.com/c\n&gt; xyz.com/c/d\n&gt; \n&gt; To me, the first seed indirectly implies the remaining seeds. \n&gt; Now, how is the heritrix designed to handle this? Will it be able to make out the duplicates in the very beginning when it reads the list and discards the rest? \n&gt; Once, I ran my crawler with similar entries like cited above (making extra sure I get the MOST important contents in any case!) and noticed the crawl-data size to be considerably large! Did my crawler WARC&#39;ed the same data repeatedly?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Pranay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
