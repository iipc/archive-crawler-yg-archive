There \nshould only be one ServerCache, so an instance is created there, and all \nlater ServerCache references should refer back to it. However, the \nimmediately following &#39;server-cache&#39; definition inside the &#39;root&#39; map \ncan&#39;t be filled by autowire references, as the exception indicates.\n\nI&#39;m not certain if that&#39;s a truly necessary restriction, but a \nworkaround that removed the problem for me was to ensure that the \n&#39;root:server-cache&#39; definition comes right before, rather than right \nafter, &#39;root:queue-assignment-policy&#39;.\n\nThis can&#39;t be done via the web UI; I did it in the on-disk global.sheet \nbefore attempting to swap in BucketQueueAssignmentPolicy.\n\nA small test crawl with BucketQueueAssignmentPolicy then launched and \ncompleted.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nPratyush Banerjee wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Gordon,\n&gt; \n&gt; Initially my application crashed due to selection of the \n&gt; BucketQueueAssignmentPolicy. Obviously i had changed other default \n&gt; options like the\n&gt; Archiver, and the politeness settings including max-retry and \n&gt; retry-del;ay and fetch-http-timeout.\n&gt; \n&gt; However after the application crashed i tried changing the \n&gt; queueAssignmentPolicy in a frtesh installation of heritrix-2.0 and i \n&gt; chose the profile basic-seed-sites crawl. But still the app crashed with \n&gt; the same errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also tried selecting optionally a BdbServerCache or a \n&gt; DefaultServerCache along with the BucketQueueAssignmentPolicy but to no \n&gt; avail.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pratyush\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt;\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wed, 7 May 2008 2:31 am\n&gt; Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] Exception in usage of \n&gt; BucketQueueAssignmentPolicy in Heritrix-2.0.0\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspect this is a different issue entirely. Have you made other\n&gt; changes to the default configuration, besides specifying a\n&gt; BucketQueueAssignme ntPolicy?\n&gt; \n&gt; Or is starting with a default configuration and only changing to\n&gt; BucketQueueAssignme ntPolicy enough to trigger this error on launch?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; Pratyush Banerjee wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; Thanks Gordon for your prompt reply.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; I already tried the changes you suggested.? But that does not however \n&gt; solve the problem. I tried making the Key public and getting a \n&gt; KeyManager to add keys in a static block within the class.? The previous \n&gt; error was gone? obviously.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; But when i ran that code it again crashed giving me the following error.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; java.lang.RuntimeEx ception: org.archive. settings. path.PathChangeE \n&gt; xception: Can&#39;t autowire map elements.\n&gt;  &gt; ??? at org.archive. crawler.framewor k.EngineImpl. launchJob( \n&gt; EngineImpl. java:378)\n&gt;  &gt; ??? at sun.reflect.
