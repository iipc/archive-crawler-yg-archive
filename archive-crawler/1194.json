I got to know\n&gt; a lot about heritrix after reading some of the mails here and am glad\n&gt; to see that people here are willing to help others.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have couple of questions and it would be wonderful if any of the\n&gt; Heritrix experts here can help me out.\n&gt;\n&gt; a. From what I have assimilated about Heritrix it seems that it does\n&gt; not have any option for doing a Focused crawl yet. Till now I was\n&gt; using iVia focused crawler but I want to know if I can do the same\n&gt; with Heritrix.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; b. Is there any way I can hook up a classifier like Bow with Heritrix\n&gt; and hence run a simple focused crawl?  By running a focused crawl I\n&gt; mean (something of the sort of) taking into consideration the\n&gt; judgement of a trained classifier before adding any URL to Frontier.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please let me know if anyone of you have used Heritrix to run a\n&gt; focused crawl and how you did it.\n&gt;\nThe focusing dials on Heritrix are in synopsis:\n\n- Scope (Domain, Host, Path, etc.)\n- Filters (Regex on URL, Regex on Content-Type, etc.).\n- Size of response, time to complete response.\n\nSounds like you want a &#39;classification dial&#39; of some sort.  Can you \ndescribe what this classifier would do?\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; thanks in advance,\n&gt;\n&gt; Saurabh\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
