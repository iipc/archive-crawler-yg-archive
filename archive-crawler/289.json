I am currently using version 0.9.0. My \nobjective is to limit the amount of data scooped from a site onto the \nARC file. I tried using the HTTP Processor max-length-bytes and the \nArchiver max-size-bytes.\n\nThe Processor max-length-bytes seems to work at some level as the \nrequests are reported as length-truncated in the logs, but the actual \nHTML files still make it into the archive.\n\nThe Archive max-size-bytes appears to be ignored. Looking at the \ncode, it does not seem to be used by the ARCWriterProcessor class or \nany other class for that matter...I just starting digging through the \ncode earlier today.\n\nI continue my experimentation and code reading, but figured, I&#39;d \ncheck in to see if I am missing something very obvious or if anyone \nhad experienced similar behavior.\n\nThanks in advance for your time,\nSeb\n\n\n\n\n"}}
