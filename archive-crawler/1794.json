I don&#39;t see the pollution of the source tree as a problem, but\n&gt; &gt; that&#39;s just my opinion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; John Erik Halse\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi John Erik,\n&gt; \n&gt; just a small comment for clarification.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving classes to another source folder does not mean moving into another \n&gt; package. The separation of application and test classes which I propose would \n&gt; result in a directory structure similar to the following one:\n&gt; \n&gt; src/\n&gt;     main/\n&gt;         org/\n&gt;             archive/\n&gt;                 crawler/\n&gt;                     Heritrix.java\n&gt;     test/\n&gt;         org/\n&gt;             archive/\n&gt;                 crawler/\n&gt;                     HeritrixTest.java\n&gt;                     SimpleHttpServerMockup.java\n&gt;                     example-order.xml\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite the two source folders, HeritrixTest and Heritrix still remain in the \n&gt; same (logical) package, namely org.archive.crawler. That way, you can still \n&gt; test methods with default (package) or protected visibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Christian\n\n\n"}}
