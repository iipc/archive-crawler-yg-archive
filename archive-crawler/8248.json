Everything=\r\n looks fine up until about 15 to 17 minutes towards the capture where the j=\r\nob says it is &#39;running&#39; but nothing is really happening after that. The log=\r\n is not changing. I have checked the other logs (alert, the heritrix_out.lo=\r\ng, etc..). None is showing any signs of problems or issues.\n\nI have tried r=\r\nunning the job twice....and the same thing pretty much happens....Heritrix =\r\nis just hanging there. It has been hanging there for the last 45 minutes or=\r\n so. I have checked the memory...everything looks ok..still plenty.\n\nAm I m=\r\nissing something ?? is there a problem with the site I am visiting?\nHere is=\r\n what I see on the job page:\n\nTotals\n    317 downloaded + 3 queued =3D 320 =\r\ntotal\n    5.4 MiB crawled (5.4 MiB novel, 0 B dupByHash, 0 B notModified)\nA=\r\nlerts\n    none\nRates\n    0 URIs/sec (0.12 avg); 0 KB/sec (2 avg)\nLoad\n    0=\r\n active of 25 threads; 1 congestion ratio; 3 deepest queue; 3 average depth=\r\n\nElapsed\n    45m43s5ms\nThreads\n    25 threads: 25 ABOUT_TO_GET_URI; 25 noAc=\r\ntiveProcessor \nFrontier\n    RUN - 6 URI queues: 1 active (0 in-process; 0 r=\r\neady; 1 snoozed); 0 inactive; 0 ineligible; 0 retired; 5 exhausted \nMemory\n=\r\n    65256 KiB used; 110884 KiB current heap; 506816 KiB max heap\n\n\nThank yo=\r\nu,\n\n\n"}}
