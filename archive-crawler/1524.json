I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; definitely have the heritrix jar and the heritrix directory in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; classpath.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I went into the uni computing service, and looked at the code with the\n&gt; guy there. It seems that Heritrix overrides CLASSPATH, and looks for\n&gt; things where it thinks they should be rather than where I put in\n&gt; CLASSPATH. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
