Is there a way to minimize its size?\n\nNot really.\n\nAt checkpoints, logs are rotated, so you could compress or move away \nearly parts of the log.\n\nWe have occasionally considered auto-compressing the crawl.log like the \nrecovery log, but it is fairly important for the crawl.log to be easily \nrandomly accessible, and for the last few lines to be precise \n(especially in the aftermath of a crash, which might have prevented \ncompression buffers from being flushed). Also, in our operations we \nconsider storage of metadata like log lines to be very cheap (especially \nwith respect to the content, which is many magnitudes larger), so don&#39;t \nreally optimize it for size.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
