I&#39;ve got it crawling and inserting pages into a database.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just wondering what kind of scheduling functionality is\navailable in\n&gt; &gt; heritrix.\n&gt; &gt; For example.. is there a way to schedule a job to run at 2:00 AM\nevery 3\n&gt; &gt; days? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ok.. I&#39;ve been doing some more investigation and I&#39;m thinking of using\n&gt; another java scheduler (http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/) and I was\n&gt; thinking of setting up jobs in heritrix via the JMX interface.\n&gt; The only problem is that the JMX interface appears to be quite primitive\n&gt; in comparison to the web interface. :P\n\nYes. But we intend fixing this real soon (Check HEAD. \nEnabling/disabling &#39;crawling&#39; mode and adding jobs have just been\nadded to the JMX vocabulary).\n\n&gt; Are there plans to improve the functionality of the JMX interface? If\n&gt; not.. How hard would it be to do it myself?\n&gt; \nImproving the JMX remote control facility in Heritrix is a priority\nfor us here at the archive.  At a minimum we look at is as core to our\nmultimachine strategy.\n\nThis issue, &#39;[ 1173597 ] jmx api&#39;\n(https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102&func=detail&aid=1173597),\nhas coarse notes on what we&#39;re thinking of adding.  Is there anything\nthat you&#39;d add to this list? \n\nOther general thoughts on the JMX strategy would be:\n+ Should be possible to run a &#39;headless&#39; Heritrix -- i.e. no Web UI --\nand be able to do all via JMX that you can from the Web UI (This is a\nways off but when in place, would make sense to move the WUI to go via\nJMX).\n+ To keep to OpenMBeans, if at all possible, so we&#39;re explicit that no\nneed to load clients w/ Heritrix-particular classes undoing involved\nJMX operation returns: e.g. Frontier reports, etc. (I was going to\nmake a start on converting current, basic API to OpenMBean from\nStandardMBeans this week, time permitting).\n\nAnything else we should consider?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; Otherwise.. are there any other ways I can automate configuring/running\n&gt; jobs in heritrix?\n&gt; The web interface is very nice, but I need to be able to automate the\n&gt; process so that a real user isn&#39;t required.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any ideas? :)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Dennis\n\n\n\n"}}
