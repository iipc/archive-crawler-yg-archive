I have\n&gt; tried on both cygwin and windows NT command prompt (but would prefer\n&gt; to use the latter).\n&gt;\n&gt; In Windows, I saved heritrix inside a folder &#92;project and added\n&gt; &#92;project to the classfile. I set %HERITRIX_HOME% to the right place.\n&gt; But now I have no idea of how to get it to run (typing java heritrix\n&gt; throws Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.noClassDefFoundError:\n&gt; heritrix)\n\nThere is no class &#39;heritrix&#39;.  There is &#39;org.archive.crawler.Heritrix&#39; \nso typing &#39;java org.archive.crawler.Heritrix&#39; should get something \nrunning if your CLASSPATH is right (Make sure that the heritrix jar \ncomes before all others).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In Cygwin, I set %HERITRIX_HOME% and %JAVA_HOME% to the appropriate\n&gt; places, chmod&#39;ed, then tried to run. It said Starting heritrix... then\n&gt; continued to print out dots for over an hour. Is it meant to take this\n&gt; long?\n\nLook in heritrix_out.log and heritrix_dmesg.log if present.  These \nshould tell you why its not starting.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone can help it would be really appreciated. Please note that I\n&gt; have very little computer knowledge (I only got my first computer 2\n&gt; months ago), so don&#39;t assume I know how to do anything. Explain as if\n&gt; to a very small child - I promise not to feel patronised!\n\nSmile.\n\n (You have seen section &#39;2.1.1.3.
