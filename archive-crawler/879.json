When I run heritrix, I see two\nprocesses in the shell, a Java -DHeritrix and a /bin/sh Heritrix\nprocess. The Java heritrix process unloads and the crawl ends, but the\nsh script still hangs and never unloads, it just keeps outputing a\ndot. I&#39;m just gonna bypass the shell script altogether, just wanted to\nsee if there was a simple solution to this problem, because its\nhappening on two different machines. \n\n-Ahnu\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ahnu Nahki wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ahnu Nahki&quot; &lt;ahnunahki@t...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I have a java class that invokes heritrix from a linux shell. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt;command is this &quot;/home/apps/heritrix/bin/heritrix --nowui\n&gt; &gt;&gt;/home/apps/heritrix/conf/profiles/Simple/order.xml &quot;. The site is\n&gt; &gt;&gt;crawled with no problems, but this process stays stuck indefinitely.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; Which version are you using?  I just tried this with a simple order\nfile \n&gt; and it crawled and exited fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; What do the logs say?  Is the crawler still working on an URL?  Does\nthe \n&gt; progress-statistics.log have a line that says something like \n&gt; &#39;20040825184719 CRAWL ENDED - Finished&#39; in it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is the heritrix process still running?  Is it just your java launcher \n&gt; that is hung?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;When I ran it manually, I noticed that it would just say &#39;Starting\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Heritrix...&#39;, and would keep writing a dot and never stop. My question\n&gt; &gt;&gt;is, how do I crawl a site and than once the site is crawled the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;heritrix process shuts down. I could have sworn that the same command\n&gt; &gt;&gt;use to provide that function, but it seems now it just hangs instead.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;-Ahnu\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I hate replying to my own message, but I wanted to update it. It\n&gt; &gt;appears that the shell script that launches heritrix is hanging, now\n&gt; &gt;the java application.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; This looks to be a different problem.  Look in heritrix_out.log.  There \n&gt; is probably a report on why the app is unable to start.\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
