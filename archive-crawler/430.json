The\n&gt; site actually doesn&#39;t seem to exist but it never times out.  The site\n&gt; is http://www.suntrustpayrollcard.com .  I get no error or anything,\n&gt; basically nothing happens and it doesn&#39;t quit.  Feel free to try it on\n&gt; this site.  Many Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; ~chris\n\n\n"}}
