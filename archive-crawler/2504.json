I then try recover from\n&gt; the 2nd last checkpoint and it still gives me the same error.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did successfully creat and run a job from a checkpoint before.\n\nIs it possible that the job successfully started from this checkpoint \nwrote back atop the checkpoint (Sounds like its possible going by your \nmails of earlier today).  If so, the bdbje logs were likely amended \nthereby trashing the checkpoint.\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Does the listing of bdbje logs under the recovered state directory\n&gt; match\n&gt;  &gt; the content of the checkpoints bdbje-log-manifest.txt?
