(You&#39;d have to peel them all off, sort, and re-queue... which \nmight offset some or all of whatever ordering benefit you were hoping to \nachieve.)\n\nYou can, however, re-prioritize entire queues via the queue-precedence \nmechanism. So you could bias the crawler to spend more early effort on \nsites that are large, or have a larger number of total inlinks, or other \nmeasures.\n\nIf you are performing repeated crawls, you could also use PR \ncalculations from a completed earlier crawl to bias the ordering of a \nlater crawl (because you would have PR values usable at the moment of \nqueueing).\n\n From a quick glance at the paper you reference, it doesn&#39;t seem like \nthe magnitude of benefit for incremental-PR-estimation is very large. As \nthey attribute to their footnote [11], and other broad-crawl studies \nhave also suggested, &quot;even a random strategy can perform well on the \nWeb, in the sense that a random walk on the Web is biased towards pages \nwith high Pagerank&quot;. For this reason, I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about \ncrawling in PR-order unless you know you often have to cut your crawl \nshort and thus strongly suspect more important pages are not being \ncrawled... and even in that case, in a repeated crawl series you could \nadjust future crawls to offset this problem.\n\nAlso important to note: a strict &#39;breadth-first&#39; crawl isn&#39;t a realistic \ndescription of any large politeness-limited crawl. Almost immediately in \nany crawl, politeness-to-servers means you may only be a few hops deep \ninto big sites, while being arbitrarily deep on other paths that are \nspread over many non-politeness-bottlenecked servers. This certainly \nhelps in discovering (and crawling to completeness) new and \nsmall-URI-count independent servers... though it leaves the risk that \npotentially &#39;important&#39; (by PR) pages, &#39;deep&#39; within large servers, may \nnot be reached within some capped time/storage budget.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 11/7/11 11:08 AM, David Pane wrote:\n&gt; Hi Noah,\n&gt;\n&gt; OPIC stands for Online Page Importance Computation.\n&gt;\n&gt; This scoring is in Nutch as a plugin\n&gt;\n&gt; Here is a paper that shows that OPIC scoring is better than a breadth\n&gt; first crawl.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Crawling a country: better strategies than breadth-first for web page\n&gt; ordering&quot;\n&gt; http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1062768\n&gt;\n&gt; --David\n&gt; On 11/7/2011 12:18 PM, Noah Levitt wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hello David,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What is OPIC?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Noah\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 2011-10-31 12:37 , david_pane1 wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it possible to apply a crawling strategy based OPIC algorithm to a\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Heritrix 3.x crawl?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; We initially though that we could use the URI precedence, but it\n&gt;&gt;&gt; appears that there isn&#39;t any provision for a URI&#39;s precedence to\n&gt;&gt;&gt; change after initial assignment and as stated here\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/6022 by\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Gordon, depending on how they are queued, they could be crawled out of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; order.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Can anyone share some insight on this?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; --David\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
