So, in most cases you want \nto get them both. However, if you are not interested in replaying \nharvested documents you can choose not save redirects by using filters \non ARCWriter (or some other writer). Or you can easily add a new regular \nexpression cannon rule to avoid getting both. In this case be sure that \nURLs that you shown below are really duplicates.\n\nI hope this helps.\ni.\n\n\n&gt; I am pretty certain there is something I am not doing right, just that I \n&gt; am trying to pin point the issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am seeing pages\n&gt; http://xyz.com/target\n&gt; and\n&gt; http://xyz.com/target/\n&gt; \n&gt; both fetched separately. Any Pointers are greatly appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anmol\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
