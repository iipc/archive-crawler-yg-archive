Thus it&#39;s still for=\r\n \n&gt; adventurous developers curious about the crawler internals.\n&gt; \n&gt; As soo=\r\nn as the branch web UI reaches rough parity with the web UI of \n&gt; 1.X, so t=\r\nhat expert users who can run from SVN snapshots/auto-builds \n&gt; would be com=\r\nfortable exploring, the branch will be merged back into the \n&gt; SVN trunk.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; When the changes are stable enough for our standard suite of crawls, it=\r\n \n&gt; will become a 2.0.0 candidate release and then official release. Even \n=\r\n&gt; then, those running regular crawls, and familiar with the old Heritrix, \n=\r\n&gt; may choose to linger on 1.12.1 for a while, rather than immediately \n&gt; ta=\r\nking the adjustment hit. Major new functionality in frontier \n&gt; configurati=\r\non and control is planned for 2.2 about 2 months after 2.0.\n&gt; \n&gt; So:\n&gt; - 1.=\r\n12.1 is the latest-and-greatest official release\n&gt; - SVN trunk is still 1.1=\r\n2.1-based\n&gt; - 2.0.0 work is underway in the &#39;pjack_settings&#39; branch, but wo=\r\nuld be a \n&gt; challenging way to get started with Heritrix until this work co=\r\nmes back \n&gt; into trunk\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps you make the right choice for y=\r\nour interests,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; Paul Jack wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Heritrix 2.0 de=\r\nvelopment is proceeding in the svn branch  \n&gt; &gt; pjack_settings.
