It contain=\r\ned only a\n&gt; URIRegExpFilter which returns true if the regular expression is=\r\n matched.\n&gt; But still it is not working.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         The urls of the gi=\r\nf/pdf files, which get picked, match the\nregular\n&gt; expression (tested using=\r\n a simple java program).\n&gt; That means the regular expression is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going wrong here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sajid\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nn 1/20/07, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   sajid khan wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont want to save images and pdf files while crawling under t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; domainScope.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, I enabled the additionalScopeFocus filter a=\r\nnd set it to\nreturn false\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when the below reg exp is satisfied:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n.*(?i)(*&#92;&#92;.(jpg|jpeg|gif|tiff|svg|pdf))$*&lt;\n&gt; &gt; file://%5C%5C.%28jpg%7Cjpeg%=\r\n7Cgif%7Ctiff%7Csvg%7Cpdf%29%29$/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In spite of this, gif a=\r\nnd jpegs get picked up.
