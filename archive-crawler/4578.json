This provides the UI\nwith multiple names for the same Processor.\n\nNote that you don&#39;t actually have to edit the Processor.options file as\nsuch. You can simple create a jar file that contains a file name\nProcessors.options under a modules directory (i.e. same structure as the\nHeritrix.jar). The contents of this file are then appended to what is found\nin the Heritrix bundled file as long as you jar is in the Heritrix lib\ndirectory. This, by the way, is how the DeDuplicator adds itself to the UI.\n\n- Kris\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; [mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Gordon Mohr\n&gt; Sent: 28. september 2007 22:28\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] multiple ExtractorImpliedURI \n&gt; extractors in one crawl\n&gt; \n&gt; Bjarne Andersen wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Would it be possible to add multiple ExtractorImpliedURI \n&gt; extractors to one crawl.\n&gt; &gt; I have a website where a trigger-URI should generate 3 other URIs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Could this be done by adding three extractors with the same \n&gt; trigger ? \n&gt; &gt; - or even more logical three build-patterns from the same trigger\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s certainly possible to have more than one \n&gt; ExtractorImpliedURI, though the web UI is flawed in making it \n&gt; unnecessarily hard; see:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1068 \n&gt; &lt;http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1068&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For now, you have to hand-edit a crawl order file to put more \n&gt; than one Processor of the same implementing class into a \n&gt; single processing-chain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another option to consider for situations where one URI \n&gt; implies many, or the implied URIs can&#39;t be constructed with \n&gt; the build-pattern, would be to write a Beanshell script which \n&gt; does the required analysis/construction, and use the \n&gt; BeanshellProcessor.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
