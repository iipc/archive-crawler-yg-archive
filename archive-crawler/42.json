I wil=\r\nl get the results in the next two days. Some initial\n    insights into it a=\r\nre\n    - Oceanstore manages both Tx and Rx in a single stage.\n    - It just=\r\n holds the responses in memory only. It does not write into tmp files if th=\r\ney are huge.\n    - TCP response reordering is done by using the seda.sandSt=\r\norm.lib.aSocket.aSocketInputStream class which reorders packets according\n =\r\n   to the ATcpInPacket sequence number.\n\n    The test that will be done :\n =\r\n   - Port the downloader code ( which we had written earlier during the jav=\r\na nio performance tests ) to SEDA framework and use the\n    OceanStore libr=\r\nary for HTTP fetching. The same tests that we did for the downloader will b=\r\ne repeated in this oceanstore setup. We\n    are removing some oceanstore co=\r\nde to make it similar. The result of this test would tell us the percentage=\r\n of overhead imposed by\n    the SEDA framework.\n\n\n    We are also done with=\r\n the JAnt packaging scripts. It uses the present CVS structure itself. I sh=\r\nall create the proposed CVS\n    structure after you approve it. Today we ha=\r\nve put the cronjob for testing the web hosting part of nightly builds. We s=\r\nhall enable it\n    for all tomorrow.

(Note \n    th=\r\nat there&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;also an alternative &#39;libhttp2&#39; package in OceanStore, but it =\r\n\n    seemed both&lt;BR&gt;unused in their other code and more elaborate, so I hav=\r\nen&#39;t \n    tried&lt;BR&gt;to use it yet.)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The TCP response ordering capabil=\r\nities to \n    aSocketInputStream only seem&lt;BR&gt;necessary if you have multipl=\r\ne threads \n    reading from the same socket -- which&lt;BR&gt;I think can, and pr=\r\nobably should, \n    be avoided.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the te=\r\nst results.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I \n    like the BuildDesign proposal; please move forwar=\r\nd with creating&lt;BR&gt;that \n    structure for a new module on the sourceforge =\r\nCVS.

I will get \n    t=\r\nhe results in the next two days. Some initial&lt;BR&gt;insights into it are&lt;BR&gt;- =\r\n\n    Oceanstore manages both Tx and Rx in a single stage.&lt;BR&gt;- It just hold=\r\ns the \n    responses in memory only. It does not write into tmp files if th=\r\ney are \n    huge.&lt;BR&gt;- TCP response reordering is done by using the \n    se=\r\nda.sandStorm.lib.aSocket.aSocketInputStream class which reorders packets \n =\r\n   according&lt;BR&gt;to the ATcpInPacket sequence number.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The test that w=\r\nill \n    be done :&lt;BR&gt;- Port the downloader code ( which we had written ear=\r\nlier \n    during the java nio performance tests ) to SEDA framework and use=\r\n \n    the&lt;BR&gt;OceanStore library for HTTP fetching. The same tests that we d=\r\nid for \n    the downloader will be repeated in this oceanstore setup. We&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;are removing \n    some oceanstore code to make it similar. The result of t=\r\nhis test would tell \n    us the percentage of overhead imposed by&lt;BR&gt;the SE=\r\nDA \n    framework.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are also done with the JAnt packaging scri=\r\npts. It \n    uses the present CVS structure itself. I shall create the prop=\r\nosed \n    CVS&lt;BR&gt;structure after you approve it. Today we have put the cron=\r\njob for \n    testing the web hosting part of nightly builds. We shall enabl=\r\ne it&lt;BR&gt;for \n    all tomorrow. As of now, only the last nightly build will =\r\nbe available for \n    download. More changes need to be made for hosting&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;every nightly build of \n    a week.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;Reddy&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yahoo! =\r\nGroups \n    Sponsor&lt;BR&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To unsubscribe from=\r\n this group, \n    send an email \n    to:&lt;BR&gt;archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yah=\r\noogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your use \n    of Yahoo!
