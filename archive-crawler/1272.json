As i don&#39;t need the Web-UI for this app i started\n(better said tried to start) it using the main-method of heritrix with\ntwo arguments: Heritrix.main(new\nString[]{&quot;--nowui&quot;,orderFile.getAbsolutePath()}); orderFile is a\njava.io.File-Object pointing to the Order-File i want to run. Well it\nstarts to crawl but it finishes too early (by looking at the report\nfiles i could see that just 2 files were crawled...). I ran Heritrix\nfrom command-line with --nowui and the same Order-File and it works\nalot longer and more correct in my eyes. The lil code fragment that&#39;s\nin the FAQ doesn&#39;t work neither as launch is a protected static\nmethod...\n\nI would be grateful for every assistance i can get!!\n\n\n\n\n"}}
