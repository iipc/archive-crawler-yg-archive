I \n&gt; still only assigned it 384MB of heap space. \n&gt; \n&gt; It ran for about 10 minutes before gumming up, mostly with out-of-memory\n&gt; errors, which slowed its progress to a trickle. \n&gt; \n&gt; In that time it collected over 27,000 URIs, resulting in about 98MBs of \n&gt; compressed arc.gz information. (That&#39;d be about 220MBs uncompressed.)\n&gt; \n&gt; So the rates per this &quot;burst&quot; crawl are approximately:\n&gt;  - 45 resources/URIs per second\n&gt;  - 350K of uncompressed archivable material per second\n&gt; \n&gt; Simply offering it more memory would likely result in a nearly-linear\n&gt; growth in URIs visited before memory exhaustion, but most likely at a \n&gt; slower rate.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s reasonable to project that, before further optimization, we\n&gt; could scale up about 6 times by using more of the available memory:\n&gt; around 150,000 visited URIs in a bit over an hour. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
