I need\n&gt; &gt; this functionality to save copies of sites for evidential purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kristinn&#39;s answer covers the Heritrix view, but I wonder if Heritrix\n&gt; is overkill for that: wget can mirror a site, rewriting most URLs,\n&gt; quite effectively. It&#39;s also very fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you wanted to use Heritrix you could also extract the sites from\n&gt; the ARC files for browsing: presumably the Wayback machine is doing\n&gt; this in some way.\n&gt; \n&gt;     -tree\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Tom Emerson                                          Basis\nTechnology Corp.\n&gt; Software Architect                                \nhttp://www.basistech.com\n&gt;   &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n\n"}}
