The crawler will \nactually attempt to visit the exact URIs in the seeds file. Then, \ndepending on what outlinks are discovered, and what are ruled as \nin-scope, the crawler may visit other URIs as well.\n\nThe term &#39;seeds&#39; is widely used for this meaning in other writing about \nweb crawling, as well.\n\nThe term &#39;SURT&#39;, as a special URI syntax useful for describing where a \ncrawler should go, is more specific to Heritrix. (Other crawlers have \nsimilar ideas under other names.) The meaning of &#39;SURT&#39; and \n&#39;SURT-prefix&#39; is covered in the manual.\n\nIf you are using scope rules based on SURT prefixes, your scope may load \nacceptable SURTs from a file. The lines in this file are read as either \nliteral SURT-prefixes, or URIs that are converted into &#39;implied \nSURT-prefixes&#39;. Nothing in this file forces the crawler to try visiting \na URI. Rather, it just makes visiting some URIs allowable, *if* those \nURIs are discovered by some other path.\n\nIf starting from the default configuration bundled with the crawler, \nit&#39;s rare to need to use the &#39;surts-source-file&#39;. First, because that \nconfiguration is already set to treat every seed as also implying a \nmatching SURT-prefix, to allow the crawl to travel to natural/intuitive \n&#39;extensions&#39; of the seed. And second, because if you just need to add a \nfew more SURT-prefixes, you can do so using the shortcut syntax of extra \nlines in the seeds file.\n\nFor example, this seeds file:\n\n===seeds.txt===\nhttp://example.com/staff/~examplesen\n+http://(com,example,\n===============\n\n...is equivalent to the pair of both seeds file and surts-file:\n\n===seeds.txt===\nhttp://example.com/staff/~examplesen\n===============\n\n===surts.txt===\n+http://(com,example,\n===============\n\nIn both cases, the crawler is only told to explicitly visit the exact \nURI &#39;http://example.com/staff/~examplesen&#39;. However, *if* it discovers \noutlink URIs anywhere in the &#39;example.com&#39; domain, it will follow those \nlinks.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
