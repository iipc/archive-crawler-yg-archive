The Sp=\r\nring-originated XML configuration\n&gt; metadata format is now our format for d=\r\nescribing crawls, as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The web-based user-interface in Heritrix 3 =\r\nhas been streamlined and\n&gt; updated to have consistent URLs and simple forms=\r\n for most actions,\n&gt; including viewing and editing job files or running arb=\r\nitrary script code\n&gt; within the context of a job. Programmatic operations a=\r\ngainst the web\n&gt; interface have replaced JMX as the preferred manner to rem=\r\note-control\n&gt; Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, Heritrix 3 moves to a model where a sing=\r\nle job, in a single job\n&gt; directory, may be be relaunched in place many tim=\r\nes (instead of creating\n&gt; a new job directory before each launch).\n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=\r\n=3D Limitations =3D=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; As a prerelease test version, there are still k=\r\nnown gaps in\n&gt; functionality, interface, and documentation; we&#39;re working t=\r\nowards a\n&gt; official 3.0 release before the end of 2009. The current priorit=\r\nized\n&gt; roster of issues to be addressed is viewable in the project issue\n&gt; =\r\ntracker.\n&gt; \n&gt; Distribution packages (.tar.gz or .zip) may be downloaded dir=\r\nectly from\n&gt; our Maven2 repository:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://builds.archive.org:8080/mav=\r\nen2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/3.0.0-beta/\n&gt; \n&gt; As always, problem repor=\r\nts, ideas, fix/feature contributions, and other\n&gt; kinds of feedback are all=\r\n welcome here on the list and on the project\n&gt; wiki and JIRA issue tracker:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Heritrix Wiki: http://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix\n&gt; Her=\r\nitrix JIRA: http://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordo=\r\nn @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
