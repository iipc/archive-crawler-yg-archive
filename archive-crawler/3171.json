This has been sort of intentional though =\r\nnow \n&gt; its possible to have multiple instances of CC in the one JVM instanc=\r\ne, \n&gt; we should probably at least give each CC an identifier (It might as\nw=\r\nell \n&gt; be the CJ UID).\n&gt; \n&gt; Would CrawlController#toString() work as an ide=\r\nntifier or does the \n&gt; identifier have to live past the life of a CrawlJob?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; tizo_trico wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi there,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is t=\r\nhere a way to obtain the UID (method getUID() of CrawlJob\n&gt; &gt; instance), fr=\r\nom a processor and from the scope?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If yes, how that can be done?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If not, is there a way to obtain another unique identifier from those=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; modules?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks very much,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; tizo\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
