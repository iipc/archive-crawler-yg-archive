The architecture seems well planned and usable.\n&gt; &gt; However some of the coding style used makes it hard to develop for.  The\n&gt; &gt; use of AList may make sense from an under the hood perspective, but it\n&gt; &gt; certainly makes the API hard to use for a developer interested in\n&gt; &gt; extending is feature set.  Rather than calling CrawlURL.getStatusCode()\n&gt; &gt; I have to know that the AList has a entry for the HttpMethod (containing\n&gt; &gt; the response) and figure out which String constant is the key.  I think\n&gt; &gt; if the interface into the code was more usable to green (wrt Heretrix)\n&gt; &gt; developers, I would catch on much faster.  Not a flame just a suggestion\n&gt; &gt; (trying to help with this promising project).\n&gt;\n&gt; Agreed. AList and strange &#39;A_.*&#39; keys should be all hidden behind clean\n&gt; accessors/getters.  Some of this work has been done -- e.g. the\n&gt; getStatusCode method used to be getAList().get(&quot;A_...etc. -- but its not\n&gt; finished.\n&gt; Thanks for the feedback Rich.\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rich Collins\n&gt; &gt; Director of Information Technology\n&gt; &gt; InjuryBoard.com\n&gt; &gt; 813-225-1313 x228\n&gt; &gt; rcollins@...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; stackarchiveorg wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dave Skinner wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) should these variables be defined in crawlURI or be part of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alist or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even somewhere else?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CrawlURI is the right place.
