Pausing\n&gt; the crawl, nulling that field, then manually requesting a checkpoint\n&gt; *might* create a viable checkpoint.\n\nDavid asked me offlist for more details on how this might be done; \nhere&#39;s a possible approach for public reference.\n\nThese steps should null the checkpointInProgress field via the web \ninterface&#39;s Scripting Console:\n\n� pause the crawl\n\n� visit the &#39;Scripting console&#39; (one of the links near the very bottom \nof the job status page)\n\n� select (for purposes of this example) Groovy in the drop-down\n\n� enter a script like the following:\n\ncheckpointService = appCtx.getBean(&quot;checkpointService&quot;)\ncheckpointService.checkpointInProgress = null\n\n� hit the &#39;execute&#39; button (either top or bottom)\n\nAt this point, the superficial reason that manual checkpoints were \nfailing (&quot;java.lang.IllegalStateException: Checkpoint already running&quot;) \nwould be resolved, possibly allowing a subsequent attempt to succeed \nagain.\n\nI don&#39;t know if there are other lingering problems that would make an \nattempt fail even once this block is resolved. And it&#39;s even possible \nthat a deep, thorough investigation could identify and fix such other \nproblems *before* retrying another checkpoint, but that trying a \ncheckpoint with only this fix would render the situation unfixable.\n\nBut depending on your tolerance for risk and time for investigation, \nthis might enable a good checkpoint of current state.\n\n(It might even be possible to restart periodic checkpointing, by \nrerunning the code that started it in the first place, from\nCheckpointService.setupCheckpointTask, but I haven&#39;t looked closely at \nthe risks of that approach.)\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
