You could change the hard-coding in the source.\n\nThis would make it so that if the website did not volunteer an encoding, \nthen we&#39;d use whatever DEFAULT_CONTENT_CHARSET was set to (This won&#39;t \nhelp you if the site is volunteering the incorrect charset. Is that the \ncase?).\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Does heritrix looks at the charset encoding specified in the META tag \n&gt; of the crawled HTML?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. Not currently.\n\nIf you want to help out, there&#39;s movement in \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=899909&group_id=73833&atid=539102 \n&lt;http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=899909&group_id=73833&atid=539102.&gt; \nCheck it out.

No conversion is\n&gt;     done on\n&gt;     the raw downloads. This is intentional. We&#39;re trying &#39;archive&#39;\n&gt;     exactly\n&gt;     what we read from the servers.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Later when processors run, they want to do various analysis\n&gt;     against the\n&gt;     downloaded content: e.g. the ExtractorHTML will try and pull links\n&gt;     out\n&gt;     of HTML pages. Dependent on the processor, they&#39;ll want to look at\n&gt;     the\n&gt;     download as characters rather than as raw bytes. For example, they\n&gt;     may\n&gt;     want to regex over a character stream to find links. At this time,\n&gt;     we&#39;ll provide a charset to the character reader so it does\n&gt;     appropriate\n&gt;     translation of raw bytes. Regards the charset, Heritrix is a little\n&gt;     lame. We just use the charset from the HTTP Response headers. If\n&gt;     none,\n&gt;     we default to ISO-8859-1. The charset on the HTTP Response is very\n&gt;     often wrong so when processors go to read, they&#39;ll be reading mangled\n&gt;     characters.\n&gt;\n&gt;     We have an RFE to add a charset guesser to the processing stream:\n&gt;     http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=899909&group_id=73833&atid=539102.\n&gt;     &lt;http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=899909&group_id=73833&atid=539102.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     Is this what you were thinking?\n&gt;     Yours,\n&gt;     St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;     thiru_sundaram wrote:\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Hi all,\n&gt;     &gt; I am new to using heritrix.
