If changed from the default (an always-ACCEPT \nrule), and the rule returns REJECT, the Processor&#39;s normal activity will \nbe skipped.\n\nThus, adding rules to whatever Processor is doing your content-writing \nsuch that they REJECT uninteresting content will have the desired effect.\n\nRules are passed the CrawlURI instance, which for any successful fetch \nincludes ways to access the retrieved content as either an InputStream \nor a CharSequence. Rules may be written in Java or via the \nScriptedDecideRule class, supplied with their behavior by any JSR-223 \nscripting engine. Javascript (aka ECMAScript), Beanshell, and Groovy \nshould always be available as options in our standard distribution; \nadding JRuby or Jython or Clojure shouldn&#39;t be hard.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 7/29/10 9:21 AM, e.bartosiewicz wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to do a crawl using Heritrix, but I can&#39;t find one crucial module which would be able to filter the content of the fetched pages before writing them into the archive.
