After some analysis of the average size of \ndocuments that we have been crawling, I would like to configure the \ncrawler (mid-crawl) to begin only downloading documents under a certail \nsize threshold.  I am considering a size limit of 3-5MB.\n\nI understand that maxLengthBytes in the Http fetcher module can be \nconfigure with the maximum length in bytes to fetch. The document, if \nlarger than this, is truncated at this threshold. It seems the \nContentLengthDecideRule is more attractive because it can be configured \nto avoid downloading documents that are larger than a certain threshold.\n\nI searched for an example of the syntax to configure this decide rule to \nno avail.  Can someone help me with this?  Can I put this someplace near \nthe Transclusion decide rule in the crawler-beans.cxml.\n\nIs there an easy way for a Heritrix user to find the correct syntax and \noptions for these options?  The default crawler-beans.cxml is useful for \nmany options, but I have found it difficult to understand how to include \nitems that are not already in this file.\n\nDue to our server&#39;s network going down tomorrow morning, I will be \npausing our 5 instances of Heritrix.  I am considering shutting down the \ncrawlers completely and resuming them from the last checkpoint.  Will \nchanges in the crawler-beans.cxml take effect when doing this\n(i.e. configuring the ContentLengthDecideRule)?\n\nAdditionally, I have been dropping additional bla.seeds files into the \naction directory when someone asks us to avoid their site.  Am I correct \nthat the checkpoint will preserve these opt-out domains?\n\n\n\n"}}
