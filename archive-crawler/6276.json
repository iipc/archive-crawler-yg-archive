It seems that \n&gt; though Heritrix by default identifies itself with Mozilla-compatible \n&gt; user-agent it fails to send the �Accept� HTTP header which is apparently \n&gt; passed by Mozilla browsers.\n&gt; \n&gt; We had considered changing the user-agent to something more specifically \n&gt; related to our organisation but we wanted to check whether anyone had \n&gt; any thoughts on this or had run into any issues after amending the \n&gt; user-agent.\n\nFor any significant crawling, I highly recommend customizing the \nUser-Agent with an organization-specific string. It&#39;s typically more \nimportant to webmasters that the operators of the crawl and their \npurpose/contact-info be clearly identified, moreso than the software \nname/version. (Also, since some inattentive or aggressive crawl \noperators are especially likely to crawl with exactly the default \nstring, some sites have already blocked that string.)\n\nIt is also worthwhile to ensure the page at the URL provided in the \nUser-Agent includes multiple prompt contact mechanisms and some \nexplanation of your crawling purposes that webmasters will appreciate. \n(Note that the &quot;From:&quot; header is usually not logged by target sites -- \nand so in H2/H3 setting &quot;From:&quot; is optional.)\n\nFinally, if certain &quot;Accept:&quot; or other headers are required or preferred \nfor your crawl, they can be set on the FetchHTTP component -- either for \nall requests, or just requests targeted at certain URLs (via the \n&#39;overlays&#39; mechanism). Even though the setting is called \n&#39;acceptHeaders&#39;, in fact any HTTP header name-&gt;value you want added to \nrequests may be configured there.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
