However, there is no cop=\r\ny constructor and cloning doesn&#39;t really work. I tried writing my own copy =\r\nconstructor, but it keeps throwing a bunch of exceptions no matter what I t=\r\nry. Is there a better way to copy a CrawlURI that someone would recommend? =\r\nOr maybe someone has a working copy Constructor? Any help would be greatly =\r\nappreciated. Thanks :)\n\n\n"}}
