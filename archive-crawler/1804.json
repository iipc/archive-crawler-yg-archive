So, the expected \n&gt; behavior for\n&gt; jspc would also be to compile just fine under 5.0 as a 1.4 compatible \n&gt; class..\n&gt; Unfortunately, these properties are not passed to jspc/jasper...\n\nI was wondering why it wasn&#39;t working, but didn&#39;t give it too much mind.\n\nLooking at the javac ant task, the documentation is bolded in two places \nonly; once for &#39;source&#39; and then for &#39;target&#39;.  The bolded text makes \nthe same point for both &#39;source&#39; and &#39;target&#39;: &#39;*Note that the default \nvalue depends on the JVM that is running Ant.
