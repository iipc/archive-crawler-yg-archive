Is it feasible to modify the UriPrecedencePolicy and other classes?\n&gt; I am new to this, so it will require a lot of time.\n\nFine control over the order that links within a single page are handled \nhas never been a design goal of Heritrix. In its usual crawls, it&#39;s most \ncommon to get all links from a page, and relatively quickly, so fine \nordering control among them is superfluous.\n\nFOr your information, generally, the links are discovered on a page \ntop-to-bottom, and there&#39;s a preference for enqueuing &#39;embeds&#39; (inline \nimages/scripts/etc) for fetching before navigational outlinks. There are \na few settings on the &#39;frontierPreparer&#39; processor that can also \nslightly bias things in different directions, but most people shouldn&#39;t \nneed to mess with them (and none of them do your kind of reordering \nwithin a page).\n\nThe reorderings you describe are certainly possible with added code, but \nnot very useful.\n\nIf you&#39;re set on this particular course, know that the various \n&#39;extractors&#39; are where Heritrix finds links in content; the \n&#39;CandidatesProcessor&#39; and &#39;CandidatesChain&#39; are where discovered links \nare filtered or prepared for insertion into the frontier, and the way \nthey&#39;re inserted controls the order they&#39;re later fetched. So those are \nthe areas to learn to make the right changes.\n\nGood luck,\n\n- Gordon\n\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Noah Levitt &lt;nlevitt@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As I mentioned previously, you can create a custom implementation of\n&gt;&gt; UriPrecedencePolicy to implement your desired crawl order. You can see how\n&gt;&gt; the precedence value you generate is used in\n&gt;&gt; BdbMultipleWorkQueues.calculateInsertKey(CrawlURI). Notably, the precedence\n&gt;&gt; value only accounts for one byte of the insert key, so you&#39;re limited to\n&gt;&gt; 255 precedence levels. There is room for finer customization, but that\n&gt;&gt; would involve custom implementations of other classes in addition to\n&gt;&gt; UriPrecedencePolicy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But this\n&gt;&gt; might be more\n&gt;&gt;   advanced usage than you&#39;\n&gt;&gt; re\n&gt;&gt;   comfortable with\n&gt;&gt; , especially if you didn&#39;t understand my previous emails.\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m still not sure what you&#39;re trying to do, exactly. You say &quot;crawl\n&gt;&gt; sequence/ order with Ascending, Descending or Random&quot;, but what are you\n&gt;&gt; sorting by?
