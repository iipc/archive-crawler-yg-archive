The state is the following: Heritrix is not\n&gt; running with SP2.\n&gt;\n&gt; When i start crawling a job: it discoveres 2 documents\n&gt; and queus 4. That&#39;s it! All  the other logs are empty\n&gt; (during the crawl).\n&gt;\n&gt; But in the Frontier report there was one entry that\n&gt; there was one document in the queue that was snoozing.\n&gt; I was waiting till the &quot;Wakes in:&quot;-timer went down to\n&gt; 0. The result was that the whole crawljob was marked\n&gt; as finished and in the crawl.log i got the following\n&gt; output:\n&gt;\n&gt; 20050224174047675    -6          - dns:www.cp.jku.at P\n&gt; http://www.cp.jku.at/ no-type #001 30024 - 2t\n&gt; 20050224175547709    -6          -\n&gt; http://www.cp.jku.at/ - - no-type #001 - - 2t\n&gt;\n&gt; i read in the manual that the -6 status code is\n&gt; returned, when the dns-lookup fails. So i thought that\n&gt; this might be connected with the dnsjava-dependency.\n&gt; Looking into the readme of dnsjava i found the\n&gt; following statement:\n&gt;\n&gt; If the underlying OS is Windows, winipcfg/ipconfig can\n&gt; be called and the output parsed.  Note that this may\n&gt; fail for non-English versions of Windows.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m using the english version of windows on my comp\n&gt; and on the other computer i tried to run heritrix at\n&gt; home. The prof has the german version of windows xp,\n&gt; so i guess that&#39;s what causing all the troubles with\n&gt; heritrix.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; So now my question is how can this problem be solved??\n&gt;\nTake a look at this issue:\n\nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=539099&aid=1149470&group_id=73833\n\nIt looks like your problem.  I&#39;m waiting on a sample of what dns records \nthat do not match our expression look like.  Maybe you can supply them, \nif the problem&#39;s the same (I&#39;m guessing that parsing of a german \nwinipcfg/ipconfig is not the problem).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Christoph\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;            \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
