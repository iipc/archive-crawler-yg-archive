Of course any host that has a seed\n&gt; pointing at it&#39;s root (i.e. www.sample.com/index.html) will be \n&gt; included in\n&gt; full where as a host whose only seed is www.sample2.com/path/index.html\n&gt; will be limited to URIs under /path/.\n&gt;\n&gt; It might be worthwhile to add something like\n&gt;\n&gt; Note: internally Heritrix defines everything up to the right most \n&gt; slash as\n&gt; the path.  This may not always do what the user expects.  For example, \n&gt; the\n&gt; URLs members.aol.com/bigbird and members.aol.com/~bigbird will put any \n&gt; URL\n&gt; that starts with members.aol.com into focus.  To prevent this, use a form\n&gt; like members.aol.com/bigbird/ or members.aol.com/bigbird/index.html \n&gt; instead.\n&gt;\n&gt;\nThank you for the addition.
