A couple other things would need to\n&gt; know about the existence of these longer keys, but not too many things.\n\nYou could do that but would probably make more sense subclassing, \nespecially if you&#39;re making changes in a few places.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I haven&#39;t tested the impact of this kind of key change in berkdb.  Many of\n&gt; the starting points for consideration are here:\n&gt; http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/am_misc/tune.html\n&gt; http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/am_conf/pagesize.html\n&gt;\n&gt; I cannot find any use of pagesize in Heritrix, which means that it is\n&gt; defaulting to something that it detects about the underlying IO system\n&gt; during build.  Is this overridden by Java.  We might want to choose a\n&gt; larger pagesize to minimize seeking to new blocks.  What is the current\n&gt; Hertrix-think on this?\n\nFYI: We use the bdb-je product John, the pure-java bdb, not &#39;Berkeley \nDB&#39;, so the above cited pages with their concerns for page-size are not \ndirectly pertinent.\n\nBut yeah, a bigger key will come at a cost.  We&#39;d have to do some \nmeasurements.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;d be minor in the scheme of things (We \ncould ask on the bdbje list if they&#39;ve done any measurements.  The&#39;ve \nbeen really helpful in the past).\n\n&gt; You mentioned an Alexa &quot;normalizer&quot; that removed &quot;boring&quot; elements from\n&gt; documents before comparing them.  That would be a useful catalog to use\n&gt; for reference in building a statistical tool that gets trained to\n&gt; recognize interesting changes.  Is there any information available on the\n&gt; Alexa normalizer?\n\nI don&#39;t think there is public information available on techniques used \nby Alexa.  Let me ask and I&#39;ll post the list if I find out otherwise.\n\nOn the resemblance of pages, there&#39;s been quite a bit written.
