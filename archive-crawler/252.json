I committed your patch \n&gt;&gt;and added you as a Heritrix contributor.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;No problem...  Can I clarify what the current header used for code is, \n&gt;since it seems to be different in different files.  You prefer:\n&gt;\n&gt;/* ${NAME}\n&gt;  *\n&gt;  * $Id: $\n&gt;  *\n&gt;  * Created ${DATE}\n&gt;  *\n&gt;  * Copyright (C) 2004 Internet Archive.\n&gt;  *\n&gt;  * This file is part of the Heritrix web crawler (crawler.archive.org).\n&gt;  *\n&gt;  * Heritrix is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n&gt;  * it under the terms of the GNU Lesser Public License as published by\n&gt;  * the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or\n&gt;  * any later version.\n&gt;  *\n&gt;  * Heritrix is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n&gt;  * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n&gt;  * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Is this \n&gt;correct ?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nYes, there are two header types.   We&#39;re trying to fix that as we go.  \nThe one to use is the one you sketch above (I updated the developer doc. \nadding in the eclipse template we use).\n\n&gt;Also, do you prefer patches of the size I sent, or smaller ones?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nBig patches are better.

Is it live code, and should I write tests \n&gt;&gt;&gt;for it ?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yeah, it looks like the &#39;&#92;&#92;&#92;r&#39; would end up in unescape.raw buffer as \n&gt;&gt;just &#39;r&#39;.  I believe JavaLiterals is about to go into use (Its a new \n&gt;&gt;class just added by our Gordon).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ll add tests for these, and fix the bug.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;* MemQueue exposes all the methods from LinkedList, since it implements \n&gt;&gt;&gt;it.  Maybe encapsulating an instance would be better, so odd behaviour \n&gt;&gt;&gt;can&#39;t happen if other code goes behind your back and casts it to a \n&gt;&gt;&gt;LinkedList (I can do these changes if you like).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This sounds reasonable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;And I&#39;ll implement this.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
