I don&#39;t know why. the queued url and used memory are\n&gt; still very low at that time.\n\nThis sounds like an issue other than memory.  What does your frontier \nreport say the threads are doing (What JVM?  What platform?).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; could you explain the meaning of some parameters for frontier, such\n&gt; as &quot;hold-queues&quot;, &quot;preference-embed-hops&quot;, &quot;host-valence&quot;, &quot;force-\n&gt; queue-assignment&quot;, &quot;host-queues-memory-capacity&quot;, &quot;use-bdb-already-\n&gt; included&quot;. since I can not find them in user manual.\n\nAre the details that are under the help question marks in the settings \npage not sufficent?  I reproduce them below.  Let me know if you need \nmore detail.\n\nuse-bdb-already-included: &quot;Use disk-based Berkeley DB to hold the set of \nAlready Included URIs. The Already Included URI set is by-default kept \nin memory. The continuous growth of this URI set in memory is one cause \nof out of memory exceptions.  Enabling this option, the Already Included \nset is kept on-disk in a Berkeley DB table. Enabling this feature will \ncause the crawler to harvest more documents before it runs out of memory \nat the cost of the crawler harvesting at a (progressively) slightly \nslower rate. Lookups in BDB as opposed to lookups done against a \nRAM-based Already Included set take about 4 times longer when the \nAlready Included set is 10million items (0.5ms vs. ~2ms).  BDB Already \nIncluded lookups slow as the set grows at ~Log(n) rate.&quot;\nhost-queues-memory-capacity: &quot;Size of each host queue&#39;s in-memory head. \nOnce each grows beyond this size additional items will be written to a \nfile on disk. Default value is 200 (i.e. 200 items kept in memory).  A \nhigh value means more RAM used per host queue while a low value will \nrequire more disk I/O. Lowest legal value is one.\nforce-queue-assignment: &quot;The queue name into which to force URIs. Should \nbe left blank at global level.  Specify a per-domain/per-host override \nto force URIs into a particular named queue, regardless of the \nassignment policy in effect (domain or ip-based politeness).  This could \nbe used on domains known to all be from the same small set of IPs (eg \nblogspot, dailykos, etc.) to simulate IP-based politeness, or it could \nbe used if you wanted to enforce politeness over a whole domain, even \nthough the subdomains are split across many IPs.&quot; (You&#39;d use this \nfacility to avoid hitting a host with many virtual servers too hard).\nhost-valence: &quot;Maximum number of simultaneous requests to a single \nhost.&quot; (This feature is not working reliably).\npreference-embed-hops: &quot;Number of embedded (or redirected) hops up to \nwhich a URI has higher priority scheduling. For example, if set to 1 \n(the default), items such as inline images (1-hop embedded resources) \nwill be scheduled ahead of all regular links (or many-hop resources, \nlike nested frames). If set to zero, no preferencing will occur, and \nembeds/redirects are scheduled the same as regular links.&quot;\nhold-queues: &quot;Whether to hold newly-created per-host URI work queues \nuntil needed to stay busy. If false (default), all queues may contribute \nURIs for crawling at all times. If true, queues begin (and collect URIs) \nin an &#39;inactive&#39; state, and only when the Frontier needs another queue \nto keep all ToeThreads busy will new queues be activated.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
