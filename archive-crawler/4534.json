release. \nSo many things are possible -- with a little work by someone immersed in \nthe code -- but it&#39;s not turn-key enough to check off a box.\n\nsyed wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;  that means most of the questions are answered no...\n&gt;  but those which can be answered yes..if iknow that it would be helpful...\n&gt; thanx\n\nSure, I&#39;ll take a quick stab at answering the below for Heritrix. &quot;N/A&quot; \nmeans &quot;not applicable&quot;.\n\n&gt;

Removal of stop words from the search query is supported?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Duplicate document detection using hashes?\nHertirix 1.12 adds a new capability to preload a crawler with hashes and \nheader info from a previous crawl, and then avoid duplicates by either \nconditional GETs (saving bandwidth & storage) or discarding exact \nduplicate content (saving storage).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Filters to enable automatic classification of defined topics?\nOutside groups have built classifiers on Heritrix; see for one example \nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1905 .\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

http, https access to secure servers and ftp indexing. ?\nYes -- can access http, https, ftp. Does not index.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; **Database querying through Z39.50, SOAP, JDBC and HTTP supported?\nNo, except for when such queries are followable links.

Heritrix can crawl through an HTTP proxy. Some \ngroups have also used proxies during clickthrough QA of web collections \nto auto-detect missing URLs.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A proxy pre-fetch mechanism?\nUnclear what this means.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A caching http Proxy with additional function to filter out unwanted\n&gt;&gt;&gt; content. ?\nSee above.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Multidimensional index to store different features of 3d and 2d\n&gt;&gt;&gt; models?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Buffer to store the documents or document locators?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Extraction of information from the http header?\nHeaders are stored and consulted where relevant (eg URI destination of a \nredirect).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Automatic search term stemming?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Standard and advanced search capabilities?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; **Relevance ranking ?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Advanced search option available?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Search interface to input sketches? \nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Saving common searches supported?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Algorithm to select databases a user wishes to query?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Search for different image formats?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; API for image analysis, storage and format conversion?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Multiple OS Support?\nHeritrix is officially supported on Linux but as a Java program works \nand is used successfully on Windows and MacOS as well.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Advanced search options, search by color, texture and shape. ?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Result page with title, date, file size, and url?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hit highlighting in search results ?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; http header request and response support?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Inverted index?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Local database for metadata storage and administration?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; A database consisting of several distributed hash tables?\nN/A.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Document storage?\nYes, retrieved documents are stored verbatim in &#39;ARC&#39; files.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
