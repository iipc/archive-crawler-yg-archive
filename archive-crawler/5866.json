So Heretrix seems a good flexible fit in this regard.\n\nI want to crawl about 200k unique domains, using DomainScope. I&#39;d like\nto distribute this over n machines, with each machine running say 100\nthreads - one thread per domain. \n\nI&#39;d also like to be able to track & manage the progress of each domain\nindividually. \n\nI&#39;d like to do all of this by assigning one job per domain and have a\ncentral management process that tracks each heretrix instance, and\nassigns new jobs as appropriate e.g. as a job on one machine completes,\ncreate a new one for another domain - keeping the total number of\nrunning jobs in each instance at say 200.\n\nThe docs generally talk of creating a single job with a seed list. Will\nI run into any issues within heretrix with having a seedlist of size 1 -\nand instead having multiple jobs e.g. up to 200?\n\nI&#39;m guessing this should all be fine, but just want to make sure there\nare no hidden gotchas.\n\nThx,\n\nJoel\n\n\n\n"}}
