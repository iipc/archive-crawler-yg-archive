Please read\n&gt; site documentation (see link below) about intended usage, available \n&gt; services, and directory layout of the account.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please take some time to read the site documentation about project\n&gt; administration (http://sourceforge.net/docs/site/). If you visit your \n&gt; own project page in SourceForge.net while logged in, you will find \n&gt; additional menu functions to your left labeled &#39;Project Admin&#39;. \n&gt; \n&gt; We highly suggest that you now visit SourceForge.net and create a public\n&gt; description for your project. This can be done by visiting your project\n&gt; page while logged in, and selecting &#39;Project Admin&#39; from the menus\n&gt; on the left (or by visiting https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=73833\n&gt; after login).\n&gt; \n&gt; Your project will also not appear in the Trove Software Map (primary\n&gt; list of projects hosted on SourceForge.net which offers great flexibility in\n&gt; browsing and search) until you categorize it in the project administration \n&gt; screens. So that people can find your project, you should do this now. \n&gt; Visit your project while logged in, and select &#39;Project Admin&#39; from the \n&gt; menus on the left.\n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy the system, and please tell others about SourceForge.net. Let us know\n&gt; if there is anything we can do to help you.\n&gt; \n&gt;  -- the SourceForge.net crew\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
