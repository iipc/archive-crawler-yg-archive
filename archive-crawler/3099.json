I&#39;ve successfully imported and re-built Heritrix, but now I&#39;m\n&gt; wondering how to get it to run.\n&gt;\n&gt; I saw in the developer&#39;s manual the bit about setting the\n&gt; &#39;heritrix.development&#39; property, but it&#39;s not clear as to where this\n&gt; property should be set.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-click on the org.archive.crawler.Heritrix class.  Select &#39;Debug \nas...&#39; --&gt; &#39;Java Application..&#39;.\n\nThis will try and run the Heritrix main.  It&#39;ll fail.\n\nNext go under the &#39;Run&#39; menu and select &#39;Debug&#39;.  Look for the &#39;Run \nConfiguration&#39; that was just made by the above action.  It&#39;ll be named \n&#39;Heritrix&#39; in the left hand list.  Select it (Its probably preselected \nsince its last debug run). \n\nSee the tabs.  Click on &#39;Arguments&#39;.  There are two places to fill in \narguments.  There are application arguments and JVM arguments.  I \nusually put into the top textbox &#39;--run&#39; so I don&#39;t have to go to the \nextra step of setting this in the UI.  The lower textbox is where you \nset &#39;-Dheritrix.development&#39; system property.\n\n\n&gt; Can I still use the\n&gt; ~/heritrix-1.9.0-200607171747/src/scripts/heritrix script to start up\n&gt; Heritrix without having to make major modifications due to the fact that\n&gt; files are in different locations?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease try again.  I&#39;m not sure I understand what you are asking.  Is \nthere a special modification you&#39;ve made to the heritrix wrapper script \nyou need to happen when eclipse starts Heritrix?  Which files are you \nreferring to?\n\nWhen running in eclipse, we&#39;ll let it launch Heritrix.  Depending on \nwhat it is that you are debugging, you may need to reproduce in eclipse \na few of the settings made by the heritrix wrapper script (e.g. setup of \nJMX Agent system properties) but this is the exception since most \nHeritrix configuration is done via the UI and the Heritrix UI is \navailable to you when running in eclipse.\n\nGood luck.\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
