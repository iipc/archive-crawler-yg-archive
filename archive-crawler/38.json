It does not write into tmp files if they=\r\n are huge.\n- TCP response reordering is done by using the seda.sandStorm.li=\r\nb.aSocket.aSocketInputStream class which reorders packets according to the =\r\nATcpInPacket sequence number.\n\nThe test that will be done :\n- Port the down=\r\nloader code ( which we had written earlier during the java nio performance =\r\ntests ) to SEDA framework and use the OceanStore library for HTTP fetching.=\r\n The same tests that we did for the downloader will be repeated in this oce=\r\nanstore setup. We are removing some oceanstore code to make it similar. The=\r\n result of this test would tell us the percentage of overhead imposed by th=\r\ne SEDA framework.\n\n\nWe are also done with the JAnt packaging scripts. It us=\r\nes the present CVS structure itself. I shall create the proposed CVS struct=\r\nure after you approve it. Today we have put the cronjob for testing the web=\r\n hosting part of nightly builds. We shall enable it for all tomorrow. As of=\r\n now, only the last nightly build will be available for download.
