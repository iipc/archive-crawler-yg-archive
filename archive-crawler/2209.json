While it is PASS&#39;ing on some URL&#39;s that were not\n&gt; part of the original file (incorrect), it is REJECT&#39;ing others\n&gt; (correct).  The only reason I can think that it should be PASS&#39;ing\n&gt; some (besides a bug in either my configuration or Heritrix) is because\n&gt; of a redirection which might be considered analogous to the original\n&gt; url passed in through importUris.  Does that make sense?\n&gt; \n&gt; What&#39;s the PrerequisiteAcceptRule do?  My TooManyHopsDecideRule is set\n&gt; at 1.  Should it be set at 0?\n\nYes, I think for your purpose, TooManyHopsDecideRule should be set to 0,\nmeaning it will REJECT anything even 1 hop from your seeds. It doesn&#39;t\nlook at hop-types; if it PASSes (abstains) on anything, it must think\nthat its number of hops is equal or under your configured max.\n\nAs Stack mentioned, you need PrerequisiteAcceptRule, preferably at the\nend of your rule chain, to ensure the DNS and robots prerequisites for\nyour target URIs are fetchable.\n\nI haven&#39;t tested either of these, but I think the best simple\nDecidingScope rules for crawling just your seeds would be either:\n\n   AcceptDecideRule (by default, accept all)\n   TooManyHopsDecideRule at 0 (but reject anything with even a single hop of any type)\n   PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule (but accept necessary DNS and robots prerequisites)\n\n...or, in CVS HEAD where a new SeedAcceptDecideRule was just added...\n\n   RejectDecideRule (by default, reject everything)\n   SeedAcceptDecideRule (but make an exception for explicit seeds)\n   PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule (and for prerequisites)\n\n(Keeping in mind that CVS HEAD may have all sorts of other instabilities\nthat cause problems for your crawl.)\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
