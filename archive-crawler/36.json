However, as they are\nrelative URLs, their bad paths are being passed to the .shtml as\nextra path-info, in a fetch like:\n\n  http://www.af.mil/photos/art_current.shtml/images/afg_030325_002-001.jpg\n\nThe .shtml ignores the path info, returns its normal HTML page (same\nas before), but now those bad paths, relative to the enclosing \nbad path, are of the form:\n\n  http://www.af.mil/photos/art_current.shtml/images/images/afg_030325_002-001.jpg\n\n...and so on, and so on.\n\nSo essentially the .shtml script is making the entire universe\nof path-extensions past ...shtml/ into soft 404s -- even though the \nserver as a whole doesn&#39;t do soft 404s.  (Try http://www.af.mil/blah )\n\nSome implications:\n - Soft 404 detection might be worth triggering after\n   certain &#39;/&#39;-terminated paths; in particular after \n   some large number X of &#39;/&#39;s are seen in a single URL\n\n - Any duplicate-detection process, which generally\n   *shouldn&#39;t* preclude relative URLs from being processed\n   as if they were new, might want to trigger the \n   soft-404 check or otherwise detect certain URL-patterns\n   to see if a pathological recursion is occuring\n\n - If URLs are labelled as to the *context* in which\n   they were discovered, that could assist in soft-404\n   and other pathological condition detection. For \n   example, it is only when trying to fetch an embedded\n   image, and getting HTML instead, that teh problem\n   relative recursive URLs are encountered.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
