My questions are\nabout getting Heritrix to behave the way I would\nlike.\n\nI&#39;m a little stuck trying to set up a filter - I\nwould like to process and fetch only those\ndocuments which are text - I can&#39;t place\nimages/zips/docs/pdfs into the Lucene index.\n\nI currently have a filter that excludes\njpg,gif,doc,etc in my crawl profile and a regex in\nmy archiver class that makes sure only URI&#39;s with\nthe string &quot;text&quot; in their content-type get placed\ninto the index.  Still, lots of non-text things\nget fetched, and I have to add whatever random\nextension it is to my exclude filter - kinda ugly.\n\nCan I check the content-type earlier on using some\nbuilt-in part of Heritrix?  or will i have to\ncontinue fetching the whole file before i can\ndefinitively choose not to index it?\n\nAlso, I would like my crawl scope to be the\nfollowing: anything below the path specified in\nthe seeds or a couple hops(probably 2) otherwise.\nI see the OrFilter and FilterScope module, but I\ncan&#39;t seem to organize them such that I get this\nscope.\n\nThanks for any tips you might have!\n\n-miles\n\n"}}
