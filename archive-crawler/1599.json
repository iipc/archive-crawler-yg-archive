This info. is used whenever an extractor goes to \nget a character stream. No attempt currently is made at using \ncontent-type info location such as the HTML META info. \n\nIn heritrix, a heuristic tries to figure if the charset is single or \nmultibyte. If multibyte we use an expensive charset decoding \ncharacter stream that maps the charset to that of the JVMs. \nOtherwise we use the default treating each byte as a character. If \nthe supplied charset is unknown, we fall back on treating the stream \nas single-byte. \n...\n\nBut, when I take look at the source code, I found heritrix only try \nto identify the charset from HTTP head, which is done by function \nsetCharacterEncoding(.,.) in FetchHTTP.java.\n\nam I right? \nIf so, I should plug in a charset recognizer.\n\nthanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
