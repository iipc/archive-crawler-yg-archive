No data, except for DNS. \nIn my case it seemed to depend on my putting some additional .jar files in the \nheritrix directory, and as the heritrix startup script includes all jars with \n($HERITRIX_HOME)/*.jar in addition to ($HERITRIX_HOME)/lib/*.jar when \nrunning, it got \nconfused, somehow (probably because my jar files contained some libs used by \nheritrix). \nIt seemed really strange, but I tried everything, and \nthe problem was not solved until I moved my jar files to another directory. I \ncan&#39;t really tell if that was really it, but heritrix has worked perfect \nsince then, anyway.\n\nThis was just a wildcard, but if this is the case for you too, the startup \nscript would really be in need of a re-write...\n/ Niklas\n\nOn Wednesday 20 October 2004 16.37, jkilleen74 wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m running Heritrix 1.0.4 on a PC (Windows XP); I&#39;m having a problem\n&gt; where any crawl jobs seem to start fine - retrieve the DNS and\n&gt; robots.txt as appropriate, redirect as appropriate etc. But once they\n&gt; hit an actual page e.g. somewebsite/index.html, the crawl comes to an\n&gt; end. It&#39;s as if the page contained no data or links, yet I know this\n&gt; is not the case (I can browse to it through IE perfectly normally.)\n&gt; In my crawl.log, I see something like the following e.g.:\n&gt;\n&gt; 20041020142929438     1         62 dns:www.st-andrews.ac.uk P\n&gt; http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study.shtml text/dns #000 0 - -\n&gt;\n&gt; 20041020142930190   404          0 http://www.st-\n&gt; andrews.ac.uk/robots.txt P http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study.shtml\n&gt; text/html #000 251 - -\n&gt;\n&gt; 20041020142931601   200          0 http://www.st-\n&gt; andrews.ac.uk/study.shtml - - text/html #000 142 - 3t\n&gt;\n&gt; Note the figures in the second column, for amount of data downloaded.\n&gt; For the front page (study.shtml), it seems to have downloaded zero\n&gt; data. Yet the crawl completes without any obvious errors or alerts -\n&gt; it seems to have found this front page, then decided that not only\n&gt; are there no links to follow, but not even any data to retrieve. The\n&gt; same pattern is seen whether I respect or ignore robots.txt, for any\n&gt; number of sites I&#39;ve tried to examine so far. I&#39;m not applying any\n&gt; unusual filters, just a standard crawl.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m running this behind a firewall, so am using the Proxy server\n&gt; patch proved a while back, which seems to be working (without it, any\n&gt; crawl job just stalled on the very first step.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m probably missing something obvious, but any suggestions\n&gt; appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; Jim K\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
