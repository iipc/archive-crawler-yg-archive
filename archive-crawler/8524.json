However there was a bug fixed in 2012\nthat affected protocol-relative urls with colons in them. See\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-2013. That bug is fixed in the\n3.2.0 release.\n\nNoah\n\nOn Tue, May 27, 2014 at 2:12 AM, &#39;Markus.Mirsberger&#39;\nmarkus.mirsberger@... [archive-crawler]\n&lt;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; recently I noticed in one of my crawls these kinds of URLs with a leading\n&gt; double slash.\n&gt; I never saw this before but after some research I read that this can and\n&gt; will be used to inherit the protocol.\n&gt; Heritrix handles these urls the same as it would be a relative path which\n&gt; leads of course to a 404 error.\n&gt; e.g. http://de.wikipedia.org//ace.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawan:Afrika\n&gt;\n&gt; So my question is if this there is a reason that this is not implemented and\n&gt; what would be the best place to implement it in your opinion?\n&gt; My first idea was to fix this probably inside the ExctractorHTML Module\n&gt; where the new URLs are extracted.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Markus\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
