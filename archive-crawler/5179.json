(EG, \nif you have a &#39;max-delay-ms&#39; of 10000ms, then encounter a Crawl-Delay of \n20 seconds, the 20 seconds wins out.)\n\nThe feature has received cursory testing.\n\nThe first build in which it appears is #245 from the CruiseControl auto \nbuilds:\n\nhttp://builds.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/buildresults/HEAD-heritrix\n\nSupport for &#39;Allow&#39; and &#39;Crawl-Delay&#39; will be ported to the heritrix2 \ncodebase shortly.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nGordon Mohr wrote:\n&gt; joehung302 wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m bringing up this issue again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; First of all, we&#39;re now doing repeatable 5B+ crawling using Heritrix. \n&gt;&gt; Thanks to you guys.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; These days we&#39;ve got quite a few complaints about Heritrix not \n&gt;&gt; honoring the &quot;crawl-delay&quot; parameter. Is this still a planned feature?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Or, how can we help to make it happen? ;)\n&gt; \n&gt; As this only requires shuttling an externally-provided number into the \n&gt; existing min-delay-ms setting, it should be pretty simple, but was \n&gt; overlooked as we prioritized issues for 1.14. I&#39;ll take a look soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll also use this as a chance to remind people that they can vote for \n&gt; bugs they&#39;d like fixed via the JIRA issue tracker for Heritrix:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:popularissues-panel\n&gt; \n&gt; Part of issue triage leading up to any release is reviewing the popular \n&gt; issues, in case there are things we haven&#39;t prioritized internally that \n&gt; are still important to the wider community.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
