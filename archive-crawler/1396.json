I do my runs on a linux box.)\n\n&gt; &gt; Dear Heritrix dev team,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Having just downloaded and built heritrix-1.3.0 today,\n&gt; &gt; I thought I&#39;d note that the DiskBacked{Queue,Decque}Tests\n&gt; &gt; all failed.  I had to move them out of the way to finish\n&gt; &gt; the build via Maven.\n&gt; \n&gt; The unit tests work for me.  This looks like this 5.1.3 in release \n&gt; notes: \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/releasenotes.html#1_0_0_limitations \n&gt; (Are you on a platform other than linux?).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, if the AList changes we&#39;re playing with take hold, it\n&gt; &gt; might be good to leave getAList() visible, but deprecated,\n&gt; &gt; for backwards compatability.  There might be lots of code\n&gt; &gt; out there that invoke this method on the CrawlURI.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Ok. Done.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; And, as I stated in my last post, it would be nice to have\n&gt; &gt; a  &quot;protected CreateCandidateURI(CrawlURI c)&quot; method in the\n&gt; &gt; postprocessors.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; I didn&#39;t take it away.  Its still there.\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, D.
