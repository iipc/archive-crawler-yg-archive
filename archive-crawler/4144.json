I expect that you will probably find that late in the crawl \nthere are relatively few active queues -- All the hosts which had \nrelatively few URIs to crawl were exhausted earlier in the crawl -- now \nyou&#39;re seeing the small number of hosts which have a large number of \ndocuments.\n\n(In some cases, this could be crawler traps, such as hosts which \ngenerate an infinite number of URLs, either through session ID \nparameters or other dynamically generated content, such as calendars.)\n\nMike\n\nvretr wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; hi,all.\n&gt; \n&gt; During the late period of crawling, the crawling data increases\n&gt; slowly, and the speed is usually lower than 5kb/sec, and few of\n&gt; ToeThread is in active state. What causes this problem? Is there\n&gt; something wrong with the software, hardware or crawling goals? How to\n&gt; solve the problems?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n\n"}}
