Heritrix is trying them every 15 minutes, but then putting \nthem back on the queue for another retry, until the default retry-count \nof 30 is reached.\n\nLook at the &#39;frontier report&#39; for more info on the queues affected. \n(Those in a slow retry due to a non-responsive server will usually show \nup as being &#39;snoozed&#39; for periods of minutes rather than the usual \nnumber of seconds.)\n\nThe &#39;dumpPendingAtClose&#39; frontier setting *should* cause all URIs not \ncrawled to be dumped to the crawl.log if a crawl finishes cleanly with \nURIs left over. (Though, it hasn&#39;t been tested yet in H3.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nPranay Pandey wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I had set up a crawl job to run for 6 hours using H3-beta. I had it \n&gt; configured to be least polite and number of parallel queue was set to 5. \n&gt; After completion, when I looked at the avg download rate (docs/sec), it \n&gt; was 0.9 docs/sec. Some of the targeted contents were not archived.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tracking down the reason for low download rate, I noticed that for \n&gt; almost 4 out of 6 hours , the download rate was showing up 0. Here are \n&gt; some of the lines of the progress-statistics.log files:\n&gt; \n&gt; After an hour of start:\n&gt; 2009-10-27T23:41:21Z       18792        2697        15071        \n&gt; 3.5(3.85)   210(192)           133             2       134688        \n&gt; 217152            1        1019          17\n&gt; \n&gt; After ~2 hours:\n&gt; 2009-10-28T00:44:41Z       21300         350        19849          \n&gt; 0(2.57)     0(135)           146             0       199768        \n&gt; 216896            1           0           2\n&gt; \n&gt; At termination:\n&gt; 2009-10-28T04:36:01Z       21300         350        19849          \n&gt; 0(0.92)      0(48)           146             0       119000        \n&gt; 168896            1           0           2\n&gt; \n&gt; As can been seen, for about 4 hours, the number of URIs queued up stayed \n&gt; stagnant at 350. What could be causing this? Some of the contents well \n&gt; within the scope were not crawled. Is there a way I can access the \n&gt; &#39;queued&#39; URIs?\n&gt; CandidateScoper.log and FrontierPreparer.log are empty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Pranay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
