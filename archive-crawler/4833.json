I thought there was a JMX Bean\n&gt; interface for Heritrix that would allow it to access order.xml files.\n&gt;\nYes, but only to a limited degree, and there was no JMX interface for  \noverrides at all.\n&gt; Are you planning on implementing a cluster monitor? Something that\n&gt; will distribute jobs to all the crawlers?\n&gt;\nWell...no. Not in the immediate future at least. At this point the  \ngoal is feature parity with hcc in 1.x.\n&gt; I didn&#39;t know you guys were going in that direction, and implemented\n&gt; my own cluster monitor.\n&gt;\nInteresting; is the code available somewhere?\n\n-Paul\n\n"}}
