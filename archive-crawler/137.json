The one known limitation currently is\n&gt; the resolution of files with relative paths, which (with the exception of\n&gt; files specified in the extends attribute) will be resolved relative to the\n&gt; child configuration file.\n\nThis sounds like the proper behavior to me: the &quot;child&quot; more accurately \nsets the current context, if the parent needs to specify an exact file\nit should use an absolute path.\n\n&gt; While this works, particularly with our simple configuration files, it&#39;s\n&gt; not the greatest.  For example if the crawler were to select all limits \n&gt; (//limits/) and the child configuration file had overridden just the max \n&gt; toes limit:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;limits&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;max-toe-threads value=&quot;100&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/limits&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; only the max-toe-threads node would be visible, even though the other \n&gt; limits had been defined in the parent configuration file and are otherwise \n&gt; accessible when selected by name (e.g. //limits/max-pages/).\n\nThe places where this would currently be an issue is in the list\nof all Processor modules, and in the list of Filters per module. \nWe should note that in such cases, you must override/repeat all the\nparents&#39; collections as a group. \n\nThe idea of mixing collections from child to parent is very thorny:\nwhen should a node replace, rather than add to, a node in the parent&#39;s\ncollection?\n\n&gt; For now we should just be conscious of these limitations, but at some point\n&gt; we may want to look for a better way.  I would suspect actually that there\n&gt; is/will be a project out there that addresses this, as it seems like a\n&gt; common problem, or perhaps we&#39;ll decide it&#39;s worth solving ourselves.\n\nYes. Two other implementation ideas (neither is a necessary change, I\njust want the ideas captured): \n\n - Each Node returned could have a backup Node -- allowing objects which, \n   once created, retain a reference to their defining node to take advantage\n   of the same inheritence behavior.\n\n - The inheritance functionality could be in a subclass of a plain\n   XMLConfig class -- so that varied uses can be clear about whether \n   they need/intend inheritance or not.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; pt.\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Parker Thompson\n&gt; The Internet Archive\n&gt; 510.541.0125\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
