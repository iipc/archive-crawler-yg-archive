I&#39;ll raise it as a bug but I&#39;ve only \njust woken up and before coffee bug forms are too scary ;-). I&#39;ll\ndo it in a bit. \n\ncheers \n\nmark \n\n**************************************************************************\n\nExperience the British Library online at www.bl.uk \n\nHelp the British Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
