Am I right in assuming the Add URIs section \n&gt;   allows users to add URIs directly to the frontier?  What advantage \n&gt; would there be to doing this instead of adding the URIs as additional seeds?\n\nSeeds often have special treatment, for example by changing the \ncrawl&#39;s scope -- so you might want to add URIs that are not \ntreated specially.\n\nNote that if you use the &#39;crawl.log style&#39; or &#39;recovery journal \nstyle&#39;, the URIs you add can have a &#39;via&#39; URI and &#39;hops-path&#39;, \nadding more context than a plain seed.\n\nAlso, if &#39;force revisit&#39; is checked, the URIs added will be \nscheduled even if they&#39;ve already been previously scheduled (and \neither fetched or waiting to be fetched). So for example a series \nof connection-errors noted in the crawl.log due to a site that was \ntemporarily unresponsive can be fed back into a running crawl with \nthis facility.\n\n&gt; In the Add URIs section, there&#39;s a text box that is labeled &quot;Import from \n&gt; file:&quot;.  I created a text file and specified the path to the file \n&gt; (C:&#92;temp&#92;urls.txt), but when I clicked on &quot;Import URIs&quot;, it generated an \n&gt; error:\n&gt; \n&gt; Failed to get inputstream from C:&#92;temp&#92;urls.txt\n&gt; \n&gt; and a SEVERE alert.  Is there something else that I should be typing in \n&gt; this box? \n\nA path is correct. Perhaps you need to use backslashes on Windows? \n(I&#39;m also not sure of the proper drive-based path syntax on \nWindows.) You could also try using a relative path -- I believe \nthe HERITRIX_HOME directory would be the base to consider.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s no Browse button, so that makes me think that it \n&gt; really isn&#39;t expecting an actual file path here. \n\nA &#39;Browse&#39; button wouldonly appear for a file-upload option, \nrequesting a local path to upload to the crawler. This option \ninstead grabs a file from local to the crawler. A file-upload \noption would be a nice addition.\n\n&gt; There&#39;s also no &quot;?&quot; \n&gt; link which would tell the field is for.\n\n&gt; I tried looking for some info about the Add URIs section in the User \n&gt; Manual but couldn&#39;t find anything.\n\nIt is poorly-documented. I&#39;ve made an issue:\n\n&quot;View/Edit Frontier &gt; Add URIs poorly documented&quot;\nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1533347&group_id=73833&atid=539099\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
