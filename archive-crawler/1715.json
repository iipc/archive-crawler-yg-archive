So for example you go to this directory site and you say well\n&gt; let me see what computer companies are out there and then you click on\n&gt; comptuers and u get a list of all the comp stores out there etc. Then\n&gt; as a user u get to review them etc. The problem is everytime I put in\n&gt; a seed url such as:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.google.ie/search?q=web+design&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official \n&gt; &lt;http://www.google.ie/search?q=web+design&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It wont start, well thats not true its starts and finishes but\n&gt; thereare no statistics all which suggests to me that it simply isnt\n&gt; starting. The wierd thing is that if I use any domain as a\n&gt; seed URL will work fine. I would really really appreciate someone\n&gt; explaining to me why this is happening. I cant find any refference in\n&gt; the documentation and Im at my wits end.\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh and this is all being done through the Web User Interface because\n&gt; its a very simple thing Im looking for.\n\n\nLook at the crawl.log.  This will tell you if you are crawling or not. \n\nAre you only fetching the google robots.txt and then it goes no futher?  \nGoogle bars crawlers: http://www.google.com/robots.txt.  Heritrix \nrespects robots.txt directives.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Dave\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
