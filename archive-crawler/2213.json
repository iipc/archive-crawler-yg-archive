(This is somewhat a\nbug, but we&#39;ve sometimes found it useful, so we haven&#39;t made\nfixing it a priority.)\n\nHowever, in this case I see that the two fetches are immediately\nafter each other, and in the same ARC file -- so no settings changes\nor recoveries could have happened.\n\nAlso helpful to determine what&#39;s happened would be to grep through\nthe associated crawl.log for the affected URI -- to see what it says\nabout the two fetches. (Were they both recognized as successful?\nBoth &#39;via&#39; the same predecessor URI? etc.)\n\nDepending on what that indicates, looking for the URI or any other\nerrors in the heritrix-out.log or local-errors.log around the time\nof the dual-fetch might shed light on the situation.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nstack wrote:\n&gt; joehung302 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Has anybody seen duplicates download (same url download more than\n&gt;&gt;once) in 1.4? I did a few crawls and they all have duplicates.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;...\n&gt;&gt;clearly the url has been downloaded twice in this archive. Is it\n&gt;&gt;possible or am I missing something?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It shouldn&#39;t be happening Joe.  I&#39;ve opened a bug \n&gt; (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1266713&group_id=73833&atid=539099) \n&gt; and pasted the above into it.  Would you mind adding your order file and \n&gt; seeds to the issue -- you can edit them to protect the innocent if you \n&gt; like -- so I can see if anything particular about them (Is there \n&gt; anything in logs?  OutOfMemoryErrors?).\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I did not encounter this problem in 1.0.4\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Joe\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;YAHOO!
