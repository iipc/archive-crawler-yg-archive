It works reasonably well except for one major problem -\n&gt; which is that it runs out of memory eventually (as the number of urls in\n&gt; the queue grows to about 3,000,000, and the number of processed url&#39;s\n&gt; grows to about 500,000).  This is with java getting 1.8GB of memory.\n\nMany improvements have been made since May (All main in-memory \nstructures have been made bdbje disk-based).  Can you update your \ninstance? A while back we stabilized HEAD and tagged a branch with \nheritrix_1_5_0 that we&#39;ve since been using for an internal project.  You \ncould use this version if you&#39;d like to avoid living dangerously, \nupdating your instance to whats in CVS HEAD.\n\nWe&#39;re also planning a 1.6 release sometime soon.  Our Gordon recently \ndid a bunch of cleaning work in the bug and RFE databases and tagged \nissues we want to include in any 1.6.  People should check out the bug \nand RFE databases and if they want an item included, speak up here on \nthis list.  We&#39;re also about to embark on a large crawl.  Large crawls \nusually turn up an interesting bug or two.  Fixes for these we&#39;d also \nlike to get into any 1.6 release.\n\nAt this point I&#39;d SWAG a 1.6 release for November sometime.\n\nTo do large parts of the web, we manually coordinate multiple machines \n(I&#39;ve written a sketch on how this is done in a past posting: \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2141. A new \ntechnique for crawl splitting was recently committed and we&#39;ll post the \nlist usage notes once we get a little experience with it).  We&#39;re moving \ntoward automatic coordination but we&#39;re not there yet (1.8/2.0).\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My questions:\n&gt; 0) Was I told the correct story by Mr. Frank?\n&gt; 1) Was this fixed, and if so, when?\n&gt; 2) What structures were changed/will be changed to fix the issue?\n&gt; 3) If the issue has been fixed, what would you recommend doing?  (I.e.\n&gt; should we hold off until a new release is made available)?\n&gt; 4) In the interim - what strategy did/do people using this version of\n&gt; Heritrix use to crawl very large parts of the web, so as to avoid the\n&gt; problem?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Karl Wright\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
