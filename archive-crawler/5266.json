I have a page\nencoded in windows-1252, and Heritrix is not able to read it\ncorrectly.\n\nIs better encoding support planned in the reasonable near future? This\nseems not a totally trivial thing to do (else I coul have tried) as\nthe code is rather low level (ReplayCharSequence is probably the place\nthat would need to be fixed) and I am not sure how to proceed.\n\nJean-Noel\n\n"}}
