Is there any\ncounter-indication to use a really huge value as file descriptor number\nupper bound?\n\nAlso, is it reasonable to think that the slowness of the crawl is due to \nthis problem, or the crawl being very slow is not the typical symptom of \nproblems with the number of file descriptors?\n\nThanks a lot and a happy 2005 to everybody!\n\nRegards,\n\nMarco\n\n\n"}}
