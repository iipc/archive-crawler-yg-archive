What this also implies is that at any point of time there should \n&gt; be only 1 toe-thread running, because of the same-host politeness policy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are my assumptions/understanding correct ?\n\nMostly. However, by default Heritrix also assumes that if you&#39;ve retrieved\na page, you want the inline resources necessary to render the page (aka\n&quot;embeds&quot;) as well -- images, frames, etc. -- even if they are on other hosts.\nThe same thing goes for an HTTP redirect response -- it&#39;s presumed if you\nrequested the first URI, you want whatever it redirected to. So those can\nresult in parallel fetches off your exact host/prefix.\n\nIf using DecideRule-based scoping (DecidingScope), you can disable this\nbehavior by leaving out the TransclusionDecideRule. (Or, configure it to\nto be tighter than the default of up-to-3 non-navlink hops.)\n\nAlso, our pattern-based Javascript link extractor can&#39;t tell if the\nplausible URIs it discovers are inline resources, in-place page reloads,\nor clickable links -- so it treats them all as &quot;speculative embeds&quot; and\nfetches them just like inline images. This can also cause offhost URIs\nthat aren&#39;t really necessary to render an in-scope page to be fetched.\n\nRemoving the ExtractorJS processor can mitigate this, but the ExtractorHTML\nwill still run Javascript extraction on inline scripts. There should also\nbe additional settings on ExtractorJS and ExtractorHTML to...\n  - turn down the aggressiveness of, or turn off entirely, the Javascript\n    URI extraction\n  - control how Javascript-discovered URIs are treated -- as &#39;embeds&#39;\n    or something else\n...but those settings aren&#39;t yet implemented.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
