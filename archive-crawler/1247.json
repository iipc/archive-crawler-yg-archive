Configuration and needed files are read off \nthe CLASSPATH now.  You can get an instance of heritrix in your JVM by \ndoing &#39;new Heritrix()&#39;.    Call #start on it to get an idling instance \nor call launch with pointers to an order file to make it crawl a job \n(This code is in HEAD, not in the 1.2.0 release).  To be done is better \nmacro-level API for control and for gettting status.  What do you need?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; ~chris\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
