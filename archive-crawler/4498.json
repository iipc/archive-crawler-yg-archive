Does anyone know where the\nbest place t=\r\no register a listener is?  Or what I may need to extend?\n\nI am planning on =\r\nusing the JMX agents to submit jobs and not the GUI\ninterface.\n\nAny ideas? =\r\n I noticed a &quot;CrawlStatusListener&quot; interface that\nsupposedly can be registe=\r\nred with the CrawlController, but I have\nfound no way configure this in a n=\r\non-programmatic way.  Perhaps\nsomeone can point me there. \n\nThe only proble=\r\nm I have with the CrawlStatusListener is that it seems\nthe messages in the =\r\ncrawl*(String) callbacks only contain status\nmessages and don&#39;t actually gi=\r\nve information about the job (name)\nitself. So, I can&#39;t get the information=\r\n I need from here (according to\nthe javadoc description). \n\nThe listener I =\r\nam trying to implement will most likely pop a JMS\nmessage onto some queue w=\r\nhen a crawl is done so that my other\napplications can go grab the arc files=\r\n for the specified jobs and deal\nwith them.\n\nAny pointers would be apprecia=\r\nted.\n\nThanks,\n\nBriggs.\n\n\n"}}
