I&#39;ll be writing a decide\nrule=\r\n which makes an RPC call.  I&#39;m not going to serialize the CrawlURI\nas I pla=\r\nn on using Perl on server side, but I will pass by all the\nmost pertinent m=\r\nembers of the CrawlURI class (different statuses, URI,\ncontent info, actual=\r\n content from the Recorder, and whatever else\nlooks interesting).  \n\nI&#39;ll a=\r\nlso be writing a custom processor that will stop a CrawlURI&#39;s\nprocessing.  =\r\nHow would I go about removing a CrawlURI from the chain\nof processing?  Wou=\r\nld just calling stripToMinimal() on it?\n\nThanks,\nKaleb\n\n--- In archive-craw=\r\nler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Kaleb&quot; &lt;lostokies@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m back looking at=\r\n Heritrix and how I would implement an RPC decide\n&gt; rule, but I need to ret=\r\nhink how to go about this.  I need Heritrix to\n&gt; make an RPC call, passing =\r\nthe HTML contents to the RPC server, and\n&gt; based upon the response, extract=\r\ning the URI&#39;s or not.  \n&gt; \n&gt; So perhaps what I need is a custom extractor, =\r\nthat inherits from any\n&gt; of the other extractor types, but makes an RPC cal=\r\nl before actually\n&gt; doing an extraction.  If the RPC comes back true, then =\r\ndo the\n&gt; extraction, if not then return null.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyone have any ideas?  =\r\nI simply want to decide if I want to use the\n&gt; extracted URI&#39;s based on the=\r\n content of the HTML.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Kaleb\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
