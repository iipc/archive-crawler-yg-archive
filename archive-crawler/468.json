But it would=\r\n then also require a custom writer module\nto take advantage of the informat=\r\nion.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;3) once we have the returned information, how difficult/easy is it=\r\n to\n&gt;write/create a reader? if we are looking to parse multiple schools, wo=\r\nuld\nit\n&gt;make sense to write a separate reader for each school that would ha=\r\nve been\n&gt;returned from the crawling app?\n\nIt occurs to me that you _might_ =\r\nbe best off not using the standard ARC\nwriter that comes with Heritrix. Rat=\r\nher implement your own writer that\nexamines the content and makes informed =\r\ndecisions about what to write to\ndisk. That writer could then write the fil=\r\nes to disk any way you like. In\nfact you could have it simply extract what =\r\ndata you are interested in and\nonly write that piece of information. For in=\r\nformation about writing custom\nmodules refer to the developers manual on ou=\r\nr website. It and the user\nmanual are quite comprehensive and should give y=\r\nou a clear idea of\nHeritrix&#39;s potential.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;4) are there reasonably well d=\r\nocumented readers for us to review? it would\n&gt;help greatly to be able to ru=\r\nn a crawling app, and then pass the reader\nover\n&gt;the returned information..=\r\n. this would allow a way to see how the overall\n&gt;apps actually function..\n\n=\r\nI&#39;m unsure of the status of existing readers. But if you opt for the above\n=\r\nidea you wouldn&#39;t need to bother with ARC files.\n\n&gt;another question...\n&gt;\n&gt;c=\r\nan the heritrix app be setup/configured to access sites that require a\n&gt;use=\r\nr/passwd in a manner similar to what i can do with a perl (LWP) app...??\n\nY=\r\nes, credentials can be supplied for certain types of logins. This is\ncovere=\r\nd in the user manual.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;thanks for your time/patience...\n\nNo problem.\n\nRe=\r\ngards,\nKristinn Sigur=F0sson\nSoftware Engineer\nNational and University Libr=\r\nary of Iceland\n\n&gt;\n&gt;bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
