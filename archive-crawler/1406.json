Sometimes these contain links to\nextensive collections of numerical data which is needed to verify\nresearch results. We left out this numerical data. \n* Electronic catalog entries from univerity libraries.\n* Various web calendars \n\nCrawling was made with heritrix 1.2 or earlier. Most was done in\ndomain mode which turned out to be useful in university environment\nwhere faculties and departments tend to have numerous subdomains.\n\nOnly technical universities were crawled with host scope, in order to\nkeep an eye on what kind of data Heritrix was retrieving (the\nnumerical research data I mentioned).\n\nIn 2005 we could try crawling the entire Finnish web space with\nHeritrix. There&#39;s no exact knowledge about the number of Finnish\ndomains but one estimate is about 80 000-100 000.\n\nNice if somebody manages to compress this info into a couple of\nsentences in Heritrix pages :)\n\n\nRegards to all there,\nKaisa Kaunonen\nFinnish National Library\n\n\n\n\n"}}
