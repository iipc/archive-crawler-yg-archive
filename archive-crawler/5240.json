We will also work to have calls in \n&gt; pairs, so that there are times convenient for both European and Pacific \n&gt; timezones.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first call will occur via a &#39;Skypecast&#39;, at the following time:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1500GMT Wednesday May 28th\n&gt;    (8a San Francisco / 11a WashingtonDC / 4p London)\n&gt; \n&gt; The call will open with a brief overview of what&#39;s new in the latest \n&gt; Heritrix releases (1.14.0 and 2.0.0), and some of the priorities for \n&gt; future releases. Then, it will be an open discussion of whatever \n&gt; participants want to talk about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Participating in the Skypecast only requires a current version of Skype \n&gt; to participate, and accommodates up to 100 participants (with facilities \n&gt; for the moderator to rotate people into speaking positions).\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone using or interested in web harvesting with Heritrix is welcome \n&gt; to participate. Latest info, including a link to the Skypecast page \n&gt; which allows joining the call, will live at this Heritrix wiki page:\n&gt; \n&gt;    http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Community+Calls\n&gt; \n&gt; Join us!\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
