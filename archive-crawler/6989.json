(The active crawl renames JDB files as DEL when it no \nlonger needs them, but checkpoints may still need them.) So, that may be \nyour problem.\n\n(A future version may make checkpoint directories with hard links to all \nnecessary files, so that necessary files cannot be easily deleted, and \nadd better checkpoint-file-management to the web UI.)\n\nWithout a checkpoint, you could still use any &#39;frontier-recover&#39; logs to \n*roughly* reproduce the crawl state as of a certain point in time. (Not \nall stats/reporting is reproduced, but the accounting of URIs \nalready-fetched and needing-fetching is correct.) Note that in H3 you \nmake a launch consult a recovery-log by placing a copy of it in the \n&#39;action&#39; directory, rather than specifying its path in an optional \nsettings field.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 1/26/11 6:30 AM, Mahmoud Mubarak wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I used to make a checkpoint for backing up the crawling in case of any\n&gt; crash.
