It handles\n&gt; long URIs, characters that aren&#39;t allowed in file names, and\n&gt; both case-sensitive and case-insensitive file systems.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s had limited testing with Heritrix 1.0.4 on a Mac OS X 10.2.8\n&gt; system running java 1.4.1_01.\n&gt; \n&gt; It does not rewrite HTML, unlike, for example, wget.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know it you&#39;d like it.\n\nYes, sounds very interesting. Igor has built a similar tool internally\nfor &quot;unrolling&quot; ARC files to disk.\n\nCan you explain the rules you use to coerce URIs into\nacceptable filenames?\n\nIs the process completely deterministic -- without consulting\nwhat&#39;s already in the target directory?\n\nThe drawback of not patching the HTML is that browsing from\nthe local files is unlikely to give satisfactory results --\nan absolute and many relative URIs will not resolve to captured\nversions properly.\n\nI think it might be possible to make a Javascript-based local-files\nWayback Machine -- that loads the local file into a frame (or IFRAME),\npatches the inline resource URIs dynamically (like the public Wayback\nMachine), and captures any attempts to browse outside the frame,\nredirecting it back to the captured local files. If the\nJavascript and the captured files are both coming from the same local\ndisks, it should be able to do all the necessary steps, without\never changing the files themselves.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n"}}
