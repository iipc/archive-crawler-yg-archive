We&#39;ll \ncontinue to maintain and improve this approach, and the \n&#39;continuous/adaptive&#39; functionality coming after 2.2 will assume WARCs \nas the usual content format.\n\nA recent version of BerkeleyDB added the ability for multiple \n&#39;environments&#39; (disk database directories) to efficiently share the same \ncache space, so carrying-forward the data from a previous crawl will be \neasier in the future: there will be a single environment directory which \ncontains just the URI dup-reduction data, which can be reused for future \ncrawls. (Now, you either use a PersistLogProcessor log which must be \nimported to the new crawl&#39;s &#39;state&#39; environment, or use the \nPersistStoreProcessor and share forward the whole &#39;state&#39; environment, \nwhich is bloated with other unnecessary info.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nErik Hetzner wrote:\n&gt; Hi -\n&gt; \n&gt; We are beginning to look at implementing duplicate reduction in our\n&gt; crawling. I am trying to get my head around the various features\n&gt; available for Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know of Kristinn Sigurðsson’s work on a deduplicator [1]. There is\n&gt; also the work with the PersistLogProcessor/FetchHistoryProcessor [2].\n&gt; There is also planned work with ‘continuous’ crawling for Heritrix\n&gt; 2.2.x and beyond.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few questions that I was hoping others might be able to help me\n&gt; with:\n&gt; \n&gt; Has anybody done any comparison of these features?\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there any duplicate reduction systems that I am missing?\n&gt; \n&gt; And, finally, are there any immediate plans to have these systems\n&gt; begin working with the WARC format?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any help anybody can give me here.\n&gt; \n&gt; best,\n&gt; Erik Hetzner\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. &lt;http://deduplicator.sourceforge.net/&gt;\n&gt; 2. &lt;http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Feature+Notes+-+1.12.0&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n&gt; ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\n"}}
