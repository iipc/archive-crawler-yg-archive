I also tried \n&gt; some other software for extracting arc file. for eg: ark, etc. etc. \n&gt; But they all show error message &quot;unknown archive format or corrupted \n&gt; archive&quot; \n\nFirst, the ARC files generated by Heritrix are *NOT* ARC archives\nlike those generated by PKArc or other older compression\nprograms. Attempting to use these to read them is futile.\n\nAn ARC file contains multiple GZIP compressed chunks, separated by a\nplain-text header. The gzipdump dumps these raw records, which is not\nwhat you want. Rather you want the &#39;nohead&#39; format.\n\nThe first step in dealing with an ARC file is to generate the index,\nwhich will include the offsets of each record in the ARC file:\n\n% $bin/arcreader -f cdx ARCPATH &gt; ARCPATH.index\n\nThe 7th field (first numeric) is the offset in the ARC file for that\nrecord. The 3rd field is the URL of the record.\n\nLet&#39;s say that the offset of the entry you want is 916. To extract\nthat entry, use:\n\n% $bin/arcreader -f nohead -o 916 ARCPATH &gt; OUTFILE\n\n&gt; While Dealing with the arc format some queries came in to my mind.  \n&gt; 1. What is the advantage of arc file format?? \n\nAn ARC file can store tens of thousands of small documents without\ncausing undue fragmentation on your disk. The format is inherently\nscalable, up to the maximum file size of your operating system.\n\n&gt; 3. Can more than one threads read the records from the same arc file at \n&gt; the same time. \n\nDepends on the reader. Once you&#39;ve generated the index you can read\nthe entries in any order, since it is essentially a read-only format\nonce Heritrix is done with it.\n\n&gt; 4. What could be the maximum size of an arc file. \n\nThe maximum size of a file on your OS. I don&#39;t suggest you do this. By\ndefault its 100 MB (though if you download a single file greater than\nthis size, it will be written in the ARC file even beyond that max.)\n\n&gt; 5. How can i write my own arc reader that reads the various documents \n&gt; from the arc file. \n\nThe format is available online, though there isn&#39;t a reason to do\nthis. Java, Python, and C++ readers already exist.\n\n&gt; 6. What kind of format does the arc file stores. \n\nAnything at all: the raw octets of whatever is downloaded for a URL\nare stored without any interpretation.\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n &quot;You can&#39;t fake quality any more than you can fake a good meal.&quot; (W.S.B.)\n\n"}}
