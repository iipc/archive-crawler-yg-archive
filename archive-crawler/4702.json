I retried the crawl monitoring more closely,\n&gt; but was unable to reproduce the situation where 90% of my queues became\n&gt; exhausted in short order.  I&#39;m now getting the behavior I expected.\n&gt; \n&gt; A related question: can you explain the different cost-policies?  I\n&gt; understand zero-cost and unit-cost, but wag-cost and anti-calendar-cost are\n&gt; a mystery to me.\n\nA higher &#39;cost&#39; URI has three main effects: (1) its queue spends less \ntime in active rotation; (2) its queue may reach the total-budget cap \nsooner; (3) it sorts further back into the queue when inserted.\n\nWagCostAssignmentPolicy is based on some wild guesses of kinds of URIs\nthat should be treated as higher cost. It starts like unit-cost, with \nall URIs costing 1, but then adds 1 if the URI has a query-string, and \nthen adds 1 more if the non-query-string portion is identical to the \nURI&#39;s &#39;via&#39;. So, it biases crawling against URIs with query-strings, and \nespecially those chains of references where only the query-string changes.\n\nIs that reasonable? We don&#39;t know; we haven&#39;t tested. This policy has \nfallen out of favor in our own crawling because if there is junk content \nwithout a query-string, and quality content with a query-string, this \ndefers the quality query-string content behind the junk, which may be \nmassive.\n\nAntiCalendarCostAssignmentPolicy also starts like unit-cost, but adds 1 \nif the URI looks like it might be calendar URI, according to a built-in \nregex. The regex is imperfect, and there is a risk quality calendar \ncontent will be stuck behind junk non-calendar content, but the hope was \nto bias crawls against endless or negligible-value calendar pages.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
