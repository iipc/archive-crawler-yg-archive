Did you by any \nchance hit a large (many GB) document or document of infinite size? Did you change any of default \npoliteness parameters that will cause this behavior - delay-factor, max-delay-ms, min-delay-ms or \ntimeout-seconds? Also, DoD and many other US military govn&#39;t sites have automatic alerts that are \ntightly configured to complain about all kinds of things. Did you get one of these auto generated \nalerts from DoD and did you check it against crawl.log to see if the alert is legit?\n\nGenerally, when it comes to setting politeness it really depends on the nature of the crawl so it is \nhard to suggest universal settings. I usually like to increase default value of min-delay-ms to 2-3 \nseconds. On the other hand, some people will tell you that in some cases our core politenesss rule \nof only one connection per host is too strict to harvest certain sites in desirable time frame.\nGiven that, I always suggest people start with conservative politeness at first and adjust it as \nneeded as you go.\n\ni.\n\n&gt; We received complaints from the Department of Defense, because we were \n&gt; consuming 1MB/second in a sustained way over a 12 hour period.  The \n&gt; reason was that (a) they had extremely large documents, sometimes many \n&gt; hundreds of megabytes, and (b) we have a pretty good-sized pipe out of \n&gt; here.  So we had to impose a domain-based bandwidth limit, and I am also \n&gt; in the process of preparing to submit code changes to Heritrix that \n&gt; limits the burst download rate for single documents.\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems the current default setup is tuned well for situations where \n&gt; documents are small, but is in fact inadequate for domains where large \n&gt; documents reside.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Karl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Kristinn Sigurdsson wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve managed several crawls over the .is TLD.  In my experience the default \n&gt;&gt;politeness rules\n&gt;&gt;delay-factor: 5.0\n&gt;&gt;max-delay-ms: 5000\n&gt;&gt;min-delay-ms: 500\n&gt;&gt;have proved more then adequate except in one isolated case where (since we \n&gt;&gt;use host based politeness) one domain with many virtual sub-domains (blogs \n&gt;&gt;actually) got swamped. But that is really a seperate issue (and might not\n&gt;&gt;affect\n&gt;&gt;IP based politeness. The solution in that instance was to force queue \n&gt;&gt;assignments to merge all sub-domains with the politness queue of the main\n&gt;&gt;domain.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;In fact I have run more aggressive crawls without complaints. Most of the \n&gt;&gt;complaints I do get are because of Heritrix&#39;s aggressive link extractions\n&gt;&gt;that\n&gt;&gt;leads to 404 content (often soft 404) that&#39;s showing up in server logs.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve never imposed a per-server bandwidth limitation. The only reason why \n&gt;&gt;you might want to do that (that I can think off relating to crawl\n&gt;&gt;politeness) \n&gt;&gt;is if you are crawling personal domains where people have limited bandwidth \n&gt;&gt;(in that once exceeded the service provider blocks access). Otherwise, \n&gt;&gt;adjusing the politness factors seems more appropriate. (That&#39;s just my\n&gt;&gt;opinion \n&gt;&gt;of course, there may also be reasons relating to crawling strategies \n&gt;&gt;- balancing - for doing this, but that is another subject).\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I would be very interested in hearing exactly what the complaints you have \n&gt;&gt;recieved where? \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Also, I know that our activities (National Library doing legal deposit)\n&gt;&gt;have met with a lot of goodwill so I&#39;m sure that many site admins that might\n&gt;&gt;complain to some random harvester, are tolerating us.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;- Kris\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;&gt;From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;[mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Karl Wright\n&gt;&gt;Sent: 13. desember 2005 16:24\n&gt;&gt;To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [archive-crawler] Niceness numbers\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Guys,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;You do a lot of Heritrix crawls, correct?  Do the default document wait \n&gt;&gt;times and maximum per-server bandwidth accurately reflect &quot;best \n&gt;&gt;practices&quot; in this area?  If so, you should know we&#39;ve needed to reduce \n&gt;&gt;the per-server bandwidth to not annoy some sites...  If not, I&#39;d love to \n&gt;&gt;hear what successful people are using for these parameters.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Karl Wright\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;SPONSORED LINKS \n&gt;&gt;Computer\n&gt;&gt;&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+internet+security&w1=Computer+\n&gt;&gt;internet+security&w2=Computer+internet+business&w3=Computer+internet+access&\n&gt;&gt;w4=Computer+internet+help&c=4&s=122&.sig=fQlbV6UXiuarNtoxIqj5Ew&gt; internet\n&gt;&gt;security \tComputer\n&gt;&gt;&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+internet+business&w1=Computer+\n&gt;&gt;internet+security&w2=Computer+internet+business&w3=Computer+internet+access&\n&gt;&gt;w4=Computer+internet+help&c=4&s=122&.sig=TJtUvUPdqjaz8ZJRC_SQ2A&gt; internet\n&gt;&gt;business \tComputer\n&gt;&gt;&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+internet+access&w1=Computer+in\n&gt;&gt;ternet+security&w2=Computer+internet+business&w3=Computer+internet+access&w4\n&gt;&gt;=Computer+internet+help&c=4&s=122&.sig=GtMYFi2Aij3DpAAcG75g1Q&gt; internet\n&gt;&gt;access \t\n&gt;&gt;Computer\n&gt;&gt;&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+internet+help&w1=Computer+inte\n&gt;&gt;rnet+security&w2=Computer+internet+business&w3=Computer+internet+access&w4=C\n&gt;&gt;omputer+internet+help&c=4&s=122&.sig=AphsIa89Q01m6trU2VeGlA&gt; internet help\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  _____  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;YAHOO!
