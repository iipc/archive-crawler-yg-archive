It looks like we try to do the right thing and read all found on \nthe CLASSPATH and it looks like the last module read will prevail. See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/admin/CrawlJobHandler.html#1165.\n\nLet us know if it works or not.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n \n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
