As i don&#39;t need the Web-UI for this app i started\n&gt; (better said tried to start) it using the main-method of heritrix with\n&gt; two arguments: Heritrix.main(new\n&gt; String[]{&quot;--nowui&quot;,orderFile.getAbsolutePath()}); orderFile is a\n&gt; java.io.File-Object pointing to the Order-File i want to run. Well it\n&gt; starts to crawl but it finishes too early (by looking at the report\n&gt; files i could see that just 2 files were crawled...). I ran Heritrix\n&gt; from command-line with --nowui and the same Order-File and it works\n&gt; alot longer and more correct in my eyes. The lil code fragment that&#39;s\n&gt; in the FAQ doesn&#39;t work neither as launch is a protected static\n&gt; method...\n&gt;\n&gt; I would be grateful for every assistance i can get!!\n\nDo the logs tell you anything about why the crawl runs for a shorter \ntime?  Paste in the crawl.log if its only two lines  (Look in \nlocal-errors and in STDOUT/STDERR for any exceptions).  The crawler \nshould do the same thing in the two contexts.\nYours,\nSt.Ack\nP.S. #launch access is changed in Heritrix HEAD.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
