This is for information only, and if \n&gt; someone has the time to work on the one issue that I found, that would be \n&gt; great.\n&gt;   \n\nThanks for the below Dan.\n\nI wonder if upgrading our dnsjava from 1.6.2 to current release of 2.0.1 \nwould improve the story on windows (I just had a quick look.  The 2.0.1 \nversion seems to have changed its API so would take a little work \ngetting on to the new version of the library).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; I was able to finish the experimentation of Heritrix on windows and found \n&gt; out that it has to do with the DNS Java components. I tried on windows XP, \n&gt; windows 2003 server enterprise edition set up as IIS and DNS servers on the \n&gt; network. Debugging the puppy shows that the calls are not making it through \n&gt; the system to the DNS Cache on the windows boxes, while on Red Hat 9.0 which \n&gt; I happily had a copy of, the system was up and running in a couple of hours \n&gt; collecting arc files.\n&gt;\n&gt; Essentially then if I can get DNS Java working on the windows box (which has \n&gt; been the stumbling point at this time) then I should be able to do a good \n&gt; crawl using Heritrix. No worries there, it is going to be an interesting \n&gt; time if I decide to stay with Linux. Which I probably well because I am time \n&gt; constrained hugely lately.\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone is interested in taking on the DNS Java issue, this information \n&gt; should help, or you can give me a shout and we can go into a lot of \n&gt; technical information on this one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just thought I would share my findings on a non supported Operating System \n&gt; and my conclusions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Cheers/r/Dan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes MSN E-mail will indicate that the mesasge failed to be delivered. \n&gt; Please resend when you get those, it does not mean that the mail box is bad, \n&gt; merely that MSN mail is over worked at the time.\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Is your PC infected?
