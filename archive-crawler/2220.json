(Retries\nand other errors also deduct from the budget, so there&#39;s not\ncurrently an iron relationship between budget and number of\nURIs successfully retrieved.)\n\nI&#39;ve created an RFE to consider making DNS URIs costless (or\noffer a costless option), with some other discussion of possible\nchanges:\n\n   [ 1313341 ] Perhaps DNS URIs should be free?\n   http://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1313341\n\nIn the meantime, I presume you&#39;re using a UnitCostAssignmentPolicy\nto aim for a target number of retrievals; you could easily add your\nown alternate NonDnsUnitCostAssignmentPolicy option which gives\nDNS URIs a &#39;0&#39; cost and everything else &#39;1&#39;.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
