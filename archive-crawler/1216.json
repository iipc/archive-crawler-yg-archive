If the answer is YES everything is solved and I don&#39;t\n&gt; need answers on the other questions. If the answer is NO (which is\n&gt; probably the case) then...\n\nThe answer is a clear NO.  There&#39;s metadata lines that are not even\nclose to HTML.\n\n&gt; Second questions: Do you know any open source utility that can convert\n&gt; the ARC file into proper HTML? Or even many utilities that can be used\n&gt; together to achieve this? Or to I need to parse the document myself\n&gt; using regExps to discard everything ARC-specific from it and thus take\n&gt; as output an almost-proper HTML?\n\nThe ARC files will contain many HTML files together with the HTTP\nheaders.  The are open source utilities that will extract the body\n(http+html) of each entry, both Heritrix itself and\ndk.netarkivet.arcutils.  Neither of those, though, remove the HTTP\nheaders, which is most easily done by discarding up to and including a\nblank line for each entry.\n\n&gt; Third Question: Are there any open source utilities that can parse ARC\n&gt; files and extract specific stuff from them, such as links, titles of\n&gt; documents etc?\n\nHeritrix does that internally, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s easy to make it\ntake an ARC file and work on that.  I kinda doubt it.\n\n&gt; Note: I&#39;m talking about ARCs that have only text/html in them. My ARCs\n&gt; are clean of any binary stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; I apologize in advance if I am off topic. Please forgive.\n\nQuite on-topic, I&#39;d say.\n\n-Lars\n\n\n"}}
