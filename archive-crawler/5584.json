I took a look into the code.\n\nI managed to fix this issue=\r\n by adding this line at the start of the\nmain loop in AbstractFrontier#mana=\r\ngementTasks():\n\ncontroller.checkFinish();\n\nNow it will check if the Crawl i=\r\ns finished on each iteration of the\nmain loop of the manager thread and so =\r\nwill check max documents/max\nbytes/max time.\n\nIt&#39;d be great if this can be =\r\nfixed in main trunk. Or if there is a\nbetter way to fix this than my sugges=\r\ntion, please let me know.\n\nIt also explains why on pause and then resume th=\r\ne\nmax-document-download setting kicks in suddenly, because the manager\nthre=\r\nad will call CrawlController to check atFinish() only when\nnotification fro=\r\nm Frontier has reachedState of PAUSE.\n\ncheers\nAdam\n\n--- In archive-crawler@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;adam.taylor78&quot;\n&lt;adam.taylor78@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I&#39;m launching crawls with the max-document-download setting set to 50,\n&gt; b=\r\nut the crawls keep running even after 50 docs are downloaded.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am usi=\r\nng Heritrix 2.0.2 on Suse Linux 10, JDK 1.6.\n&gt; \n&gt; An interesting note, thou=\r\ngh...
