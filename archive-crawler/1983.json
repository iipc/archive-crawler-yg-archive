The current version no longer works in this \nfashion. We are using  the HostQueuesFontier.   The current version \nonly pulls the main pages from the immediate redirect.  In order for \nthe complete site identified in the immediate redirect to be pulled \nback the hostname has to be added to the seeds list.  With the current \nversion of software the method considerAsSeed in PostSelector actually \nreturns a value so the candidate url is set as a seed, however for it \nto actually be added to the seeds list the receive method of \nHostQueuesFontier  expect the method curi.getVia() to return something \nother than null.  No where is Via ever set to value so the url is not \nadded to the seed list.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
