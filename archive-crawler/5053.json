Maybe this has already been done by\n=\r\nsomeone, or this functionality can be done with Heritrix 2.0\n\nBasically I w=\r\nant to modify ExtractorHTML so that it will only extract\nURIs if the downlo=\r\naded HTML has been modified since the last time that\nURI was crawled.\n\nThis=\r\n will be done by the SmartExtractorHTML generating an MD5 of the\nHTML docum=\r\nent, and comparing this with an entry in a database for that\nURI. If the tw=\r\no MD5&#39;s don&#39;t match, then it will extract all the URIs\notherwise it will pr=\r\noduce zero URIs.\n\nTo reduce the performance hit on the database. This extra=\r\nctor will\nonly check the database for known URIs. At the start up of the cr=\r\nawl\nit will remember all the URIs defined in the database, and only update\n=\r\nthe database if the HTML has changed for that URI.\n\nTo handle the problem o=\r\nf advertisements changing HTML content. The\ncrawl operator will be able to =\r\ndefine regular expressions that will\nfirst clean the HTML document, before =\r\ngenerating the MD5. Maybe it\ncould also have regexp to define HTML blocks o=\r\nf interest.\n\nThis extractor is designed for crawl operators who want to mon=\r\nitor\nknown URIs for changes (such as news pages, message forums, document\nm=\r\nanagement sites, or wiki&#39;s).\n\nLet the discussion begin :-)\n\n\n"}}
