I can browse them  \n&gt; using a proxy. The proxy can resolve their domain names with its own  \n&gt; local dns server, but I couldn&#39;t by myself. So it&#39;s possible to  \n&gt; browse them with a proxy-configured browser, even if my host  \n&gt; couldn&#39;t resolve their domainnames.\n&gt;\n&gt; I used the http-proxy option in heritrix, but it fails. The frontier  \n&gt; logs show me that Heritrix is trying to dns-resolve the domains. I  \n&gt; tried to remove the FetchDNS fetcher, but then heritrix complains  \n&gt; about a wrong profile and I couldn&#39;t create a job.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally, I&#39;ve got this configuration :\n&gt; a fetcher.FetchDNS with a AcceptDecideRule in it,\n&gt; and I have accept-non-dns-resolves set to true\n&gt;\n&gt; Heritrix continues to hang on DNS request (requests in snooze and  \n&gt; long queues), unless I put the domainnames in /etc/hosts. Then it  \n&gt; will correctly crawl the domains in /etc/hosts, and ignore the others.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way to tell heritrix to not use the DNS/resolver at all ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sylvain\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
