So from the \nperspective of recording what servers publish under certain URIs, it is \nirrelevant.\n\nOf course, it *is* relevant to interpretation, but that means \nconsidering the full browser-like context and path by which a document \nwas reached. There&#39;s enough information to consider this in post-crawl \nanalysis -- the source document still has the URI with the &#39;#fragment&#39; \npart -- but Heritrix discards it for its harvesting-centric process.\n\nBecause some may want more analysis to occur during harvesting -- for \nexample, realistic Javascript execution which *can* consult the \n&#39;#fragment&#39;-part in the location bar -- it would make sense to add some \nsupport, and I&#39;d welcome a JIRA feature-request for the kind of support \nyou need.\n\nIt still might not go into the (W)ARC record&#39;s main URI field, since \nthat is most closely associated with preserving a transcript of the \nnetwork activity, where the &#39;#fragment&#39; does not appear. (From the \nperspective of a (W)ARC, this seems like path-dependent advisory \nmetadata to me.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nJean-Noël Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt; No replies to this, anyone can at least confirm that this is the case?\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 8, 2008 at 8:23 PM, Jean-Noël Rivasseau &lt;elvanor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; It seems to me Heritrix does not consider the hash nor save it in the\n&gt;&gt; arc files.
