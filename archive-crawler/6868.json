The goal is to mirror a few government sites (one of them is\n&gt; this one: http://www.mf.gov.pl/index.php?const=6) in order to track\n&gt; changes, aggregate and index the information there. One feature of the\n&gt; websites is that they contain a lot of interesting PDF and ZIP files.\n&gt; Unfortunately, when I&#39;ve tried to use heritrix-1.14.4 and heritrix-3.0\n&gt; to mirror the site, both versions didn&#39;t download the PDF and ZIP\n&gt; files. They are directly linked (no Javascript magic) and httrack was\n&gt; able to download them without any problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now the question is do we have to modify some of the default settings\n&gt; of heritrix to download PDFs ? I&#39;ve read through the docs and the job\n&gt; description XML files (attached) and I didn&#39;t find anything obvious\n&gt; that would prevent the PDFs to be downloaded. Can you give me some\n&gt; pointers ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Maciej Grela\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
