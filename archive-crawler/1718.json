Normally it runs about 24 hr in the couple of last crawl.  I am\n&gt; pretty sure I have all I want.  I am guessing it might hang or retring\n&gt; some url that&#39;s not much important for me.  Is there any way I cleanly\n&gt; stop the current job ??  I saw about 4 arc file with extension open\n&gt; right now.  \n\nI suggest first pausing the crawl, then using the Frontier report\nor &#39;view or edit frontier URIs&#39; option (which only appears in a\npaused crawl) to verify the few straggler URIs are of no interest.\n\nThe &#39;terminate current job&#39; link should end any paused crawl cleanly.\n(If in any case it does not, that&#39;s a bug.)\n\nIf your crawls are small and you want fewer misc-sized ARC files\nat the end, you can decrease the ARCWriter&#39;s pool size. If set to\n1, only one ARC will ever be open at a time -- but multiple\nthreads can get momentarily held up waiting for their chance\nto write to that single file.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
