Anyway, thank you\n&gt;         for the tip,\n&gt;          &gt; I found where the problem is: Basically Writer processor that\n&gt;         I wrote as\n&gt;          &gt; a test goes into an infinite loop with 0.01 probability (I\n&gt;         wrote that to\n&gt;          &gt; test the effects of a writer  that tries talking to an\n&gt;         Indexer that has\n&gt;          &gt; crashed).\n&gt; \n&gt;         Happy to hear you found the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt;          &gt; It would be nice is to be able to pause the crawl job from\n&gt;         within a\n&gt;          &gt; Writer. CrawlJobHandler has the pauseJob() method. Is there a\n&gt;         way for a\n&gt;          &gt; processor to access the CrawlJobHandler?\n&gt; \n&gt;         Take a look at the LowDiskPauseProcess or for an example -- modules\n&gt;         inside &quot;the crawl&quot; should send such requests through the\n&gt;         CrawlController. (The CrawlJobHandler is an operator-UI- related\n&gt;         class\n&gt;         that shouldn&#39;t be of interest to crawl implementation classes.)\n&gt; \n&gt;         Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt;         - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         ------------ --------- --------- ------\n&gt; \n&gt;         Yahoo!
