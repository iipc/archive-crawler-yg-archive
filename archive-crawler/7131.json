There are notes about it with the H3.0.0 Release Notes.\n\nHowever, it can&#39;t handle anything not in the default configuration, and \nit doesn&#39;t even try to handle overrides.\n\nSo a manual conversion is usually necessary – and it is also probably a \nuseful exercise, to become familiar with the new (reused from Spring) \nXML format and a few of the ways things are differently organized.\n\nMost simple field settings remain, under almost-identical names (though \nthe prior &#39;something-something&#39; dashed names are now \n&#39;somethingSomething&#39; Java-properties-style camelCased). In a few cases \nthe settings or classes have been renamed or moved to be more logical.\n\nThe following process should work well for the global settings:\n\n• do a top-to-bottom review of your H1 order.xml, compared to the \ndefault, to refresh your idea of where you&#39;ve changed the defaults, and \nfor what purposes.\n\n• work through the H3 default crawler.beans.cxml from top-to-bottom, \nchanging/uncommenting those values corresponding to your H1 changes. In \nsome cases you may notice interesting new settings or places where the \nnew defaults make your prior customizations less necessary.\n\nIf most of your overrides fit a few simple templates – toggling \nenablement, adding blocks from a small set of common patterns, etc. – \nthen you can probably reduce the many (often repetitive) override \ndirectories to a smaller number of &#39;overlay sheets&#39; for the different \ncases. The content of these Sheets will be very specific to your global \nconfiguration and overrides.\n\nThen, use one or more of the available &#39;SheetAssociations&#39; to say which \nsheet(s) should apply to which target domains. (For example, if there \nare hundreds of domains that you have to crawl extra slowly, that can \nnow be hundreds of associations to a single named &#39;crawlSlowly&#39; sheet.) \nThis step should be fairly amenable to script automation once you&#39;ve \ndetermined the Sheet-equivalents of your overrides.\n\nAs always we&#39;re happy to help work through any difficulties that come up.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
