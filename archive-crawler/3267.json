It hasn&#39;t been getting updates of \nlate because for archiveits&#39; purposes, as is, its sufficent (Launching \nand stopping of jobs, basic monitoring).  Also, the fella who was \nworking on it, Danny, is gone (is going) on sabbatical.\n\nhcc will likely get a dusting-off one of these days.  Any controller \napplication for an Heritrix cluster will likely start with this code base.\n\nI do not see any issues with using it to launch multiple Heritrix \ninstances per JVM.  As far as hcc is concerned, its all the same if its \na Heritrix per JVM or multiple Heritrice per JVM.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\nEric wrote:\n&gt; HCC would be very useful to me, but it appears it hasn&#39;t been updated\n&gt; for a while.  What&#39;s its status, is it still the preferred way of\n&gt; launching a cluster of heritrix instances?  Is anybody using it w/ the\n&gt; latest version of heritrix?  Would it work for launching a mix of\n&gt; multiple heritrix instances within single jvms on multiple machines?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; eric\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n\n\n"}}
