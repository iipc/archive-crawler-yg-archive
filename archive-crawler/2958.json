Can\nsomebody explain=\r\n it to me?\n\nMy second question is about possibility to configure rules in o=\r\nrder to\naccept all within some domains to level 1 and moreover all what is\n=\r\nlinked from this pages what is outside the domain up to level 2 (it\nmean to=\r\n extend it somehow). I know there is a &#39;also-check-via&#39; wich\nenable to make=\r\n this one hop outside the domain but i need something\nmore general for 2 or=\r\n even more steps. It&#39;s possible?\n\nThanks.\nJirka\n\n\n\n\n"}}
