Do you see URLs in the crawl.log with &#39;hops-path&#39; strings (the \n&gt;&gt; collection of uppercase letters like &#39;LL&#39; or &#39;LE&#39;) longer than two \n&gt;&gt; characters?\n\n&gt; No, all are two chars long, does that mean that no one of my crawls is\n&gt; going deeper than 2 links???\n\nYes, nothing is deeper than 2 hops, so your rule is working. (Though, as \nyour other message mentioned that a MatchesRegExpDecideRule appears \nafter it, it&#39;s possible that if that later rule is configured to ACCEPT \nsome matching URIs, it could ACCEPT things the TooManyHops rule REJECTed.)\n\n&gt; If that is the case what is the meaning of this:\n&gt; \n&gt; 425 average depth\n&gt; \n&gt; that apears on the console when the job is running.\n\nThat appears directly under a line like &quot;1199 deepest queue&quot;.\n\nThese actually refer to the length of individual queues, and should \nprobably read &#39;longest queue&#39; or &#39;average length&#39; to avoid the risk of \nconfusion with tree/graph depth.\n\n&gt; I also would like to know your opinion about something: I&#39;ve been\n&gt; working on these for three days and still didn&#39;t obtain good results\n&gt; and I&#39;m afraid that my boss (this is my first assignment) would think\n&gt; that I&#39;m not good at the job. So my question is: how much do you think\n&gt; or know that people take to learn to use Heritrix properly?\n&gt; I&#39;m I going a bit too slow.\n\nThere&#39;s really no way to say. Everyone is different in their background \nand goals. Also, Heritrix is not packaged commercial software; it takes \nsome work, especially if you want to do anything custom.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
