Many HTTP \n&gt; client utilities have a=\r\nn SSL option.\n&gt; \n&gt; We considered, but ultimately did not include in H3, a c=\r\nommand-line \n&gt; switch to listen for plain HTTP rather than HTTPS.\n&gt; \n&gt; You =\r\ncould use some combination of other netcat/openssl programs to set \n&gt; up a =\r\nproxy that accepts normal HTTP and forwards to HTTPS. For example, \n&gt; using=\r\n the &#39;ncat&#39; program that&#39;s part of &#39;nmap&#39;, this one-liner on the \n&gt; same ma=\r\nchine as the crawler sets up such a proxy on port 8008:\n&gt; \n&gt; % ncat -l 8008=\r\n -c &quot;ncat --ssl localhost 8443&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Be sure to review and understand the &#39;=\r\nSecurity Considerations&#39; of the \n&gt; Heritrix administrative interface:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Security+Considerations\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Note especially that if your crawler operator credentials are \n&gt; compro=\r\nmised by any mechanism (observed in transit over unencrypted link; \n&gt; failu=\r\nre to verify that SSL connect was with intended server-certificate; \n&gt; choi=\r\nce of weak login/password; etc.), then resulting unauthorized access \n&gt; to =\r\nthe crawler interface allows an attacker to change files, and run \n&gt; arbitr=\r\nary code, on the crawler machine with the privileges of the user \n&gt; account=\r\n used to the launch the Java VM.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s why we recommend:\n&gt; \n&gt;   - pic=\r\nk strong credentials\n&gt;   - only connect via HTTPS, and verify the expected =\r\nserver certificate\n&gt;   - use additional redundant mechanisms (listening onl=\r\ny for local \n&gt; connections; firewall policies) to prevent connections from =\r\nunexpected \n&gt; places\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
