I&#39;ve tried to encode the string = \n&gt; username:password using base 64 and put it in the &quot;Proxy-\n&gt; Authorization&quot; field in the HTTP header in the order.xml file as \n&gt; follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;http-headers&quot;&gt;\n&gt;       &lt;string name=&quot;Proxy-Authorization&quot;&gt;dGYhhtdDp0bGGGGGwM==&lt;/string&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; but it still doesn&#39;t work.\n\nI&#39;m not familiar with proxy-authorization practices, so I don&#39;t know if \nthis could be your problem or your added header could possibly help. Sorry.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
