I did not encounter this in the\n|documentation, but my understanding is that the DNS server passes a binary\n|representation of the data to the transport layer (UDP), it is received\n|and unwrapped as-is on the other side, moving back up into the application\n|layer (the crawler).\n\nTo clarify a bit, the binary and text formats prescribed by RFC 2540 are\nequivelent, though these do not represent all information contained in a\nraw DNS message as defined by 1035.  DNS message headers will additionally\ncontain:\n\n- A 16-bit identifier assigned by the program generating the query.\n- Boolean is_query (or is_response)\n- An opt code (standard query, inverse query, and server status request)\n- Boolean is_authoritative\n- Boolean was_truncated for truncated UDP messages\n- Information about the server&#39;s ability to perform recersive operations\n- A response code, as discussed earlier\n\nHope that makes things a bit more clear,\n\npt.\n--\nParker Thompson\nThe Internet Archive\n510.541.0125\n\n\n"}}
