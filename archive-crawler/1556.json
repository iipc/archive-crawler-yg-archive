We&#39;ve seen this on occasion.  Odd is how the exception message is \n&gt; &#39;null&#39; in the above.  I assume you have plenty disk and none of the \n&gt; other logs are throwing IOExceptions anywhere?\n\nYeah, that threw me for a loop as well. No IO exceptions and around\n100G available disk space.\n\n&gt; These are System.out prints from the ExtractorSWF.  Need to make a build \n&gt; that turns these emissions off.\n\nOK.\n\n&gt; On the OOMEs, I do not have ideas.  With so few seeds, you shouldn&#39;t be \n&gt; seeing OOMEs.  Whats your frontier report say about queues, etc.?  \n&gt; Anything exotic about your order file -- other than the locations you&#39;re \n&gt; visiting?\n&gt; \n&gt; Since you&#39;re running 1.5.0 JVM, you might send over the output from running\n&gt; \n&gt; % $JAVA_HOME/bin/jmap -histo PID\n&gt; \n&gt; This does a dump of heap instances and sizes.\n\nI&#39;ve already killed the heritrix instance. But the next time this\nhappens I&#39;ll run this.\n\nThe order is the one I sent a while back, which includes a mid-fetch\nfilter and various other filters limiting saved content to text/html.\n\n    -tree\n\n\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
