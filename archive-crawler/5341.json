It seems to be an issue with the static-block when registering\nthe keys. I&#39;ve placed the key registration at the end of each decide\nrule and this seems to fix the problems with the decide rules. The keys\nfor ContentTypeMatchesRegExpDecideRule are also shown in the web-ui (-&gt;\nHER-1479).\n\nI think, the Key-Registration-Code is also needed, if the keys are\ninherited from super class, so they are populated to the KeyManager for\nthe class itself and not only for the superclasses. I think this is the\nmain cause of the issue.\n\nGordon, it whould be very helpful if the described changes were made to\nthe actual stable and if a bug fix release would be made available soon\nvia svn and maven2. Additionally to HER-1479 and HER-1517 the bugs\nHER-1496, HER-1501 and some other known bugs may be fixed in this realease.\n\nHave a nice day\nChristian\n\n\nGordon Mohr schrieb:\n&gt; You&#39;ve hit a bug in Heritrix2. I&#39;ve just tried adding a \n&gt; NotMatchesFilePatternDecideRule to the global sheet of our default \n&gt; profiles; the expected additional settings do not appear. I&#39;ve created \n&gt; an issue in our tracking system:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1517\n&gt; \n&gt; As the user manual and some other material written by other users about \n&gt; doing HTML-only crawls is all focused on Heritrix 1.X versions, and as a \n&gt; newbie, you may want to use Heritrix 1.14 instead. Unless you need \n&gt; Heritrix2 features, it&#39;s a better-documented and more fully tested \n&gt; choice, for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; nickbirren wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m trying to fetch only html pages. I read in the manual&#39;s appendix\n&gt;&gt; that this can be done by using NotMatchesFilePatternDecideRule - but\n&gt;&gt; when I add it to the job&#39;s sheet I get no options to configure it\n&gt;&gt; (provide it with a .*(/|&#92;.html)$ regexp). There&#39;s nothing in the job&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; sheet that would let me provide any parameters for this decide rule.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Any help would be much appreciated\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks\n&gt;&gt; -N\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
