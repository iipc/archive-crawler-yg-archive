I&#39;m getting the feeling that this\napproach might me better/more efficient than simply writing a unique Perl\nscript for each of the 100&#39;s of universities that i&#39;m considering. That\nsaid, i still have a few questions about setting up the app, and running a\ntest. My primary issues would get into how complex the jave code/environment\nwould be.\n\nNever coded in Java. Plenty of C/C++/etc... but minimal java experience...\nBut it might be worth climbing the learning curve if this might work.\n\nIs there a phone number for you so I could have a short conversation\nregarding the Heritrix app??\n\nThanks\n\nBruce Douglas\nbedouglas@...\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kristinn Sigurdsson [mailto:kris@...]\nSent: Friday, May 28, 2004 2:04 AM\nTo: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: RE: [archive-crawler] Heritrix - use...\n\n\n&gt;-----Original Message-----\n&gt;From: bruce [mailto:bedouglas@...]\n&gt;Sent: 28. ma� 2004 01:08\n&gt;To: &#39;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&#39;\n&gt;Subject: RE: [archive-crawler] Heritrix - use...\n&gt;\n&gt;hey...\n&gt;\n&gt;thanks for the response. my questions are pretty basic, so bear with me!\n&gt;\n&gt;1) is it possible to provide a list of domains/urls that the app can crawl\n&gt;through, thus creating a basic domain/pool of content. ie, is it possible\n&gt;for us to &quot;feed&quot; the urls of the various college registrar sites to the\napp,\n&gt;and have it then return/save the information to an internal file, or series\n&gt;of files.\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;2) is it possible to configure the app to only return pages from a given\nurl\n&gt;that have certain information/tags/elements, or is that better handled by\n&gt;the parser/reader function?\n\nA custom module can be plugged into the processing chain that looks for this\ntype of information. But it would then also require a custom writer module\nto take advantage of the information.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;3) once we have the returned information, how difficult/easy is it to\n&gt;write/create a reader? if we are looking to parse multiple schools, would\nit\n&gt;make sense to write a separate reader for each school that would have been\n&gt;returned from the crawling app?\n\nIt occurs to me that you _might_ be best off not using the standard ARC\nwriter that comes with Heritrix. Rather implement your own writer that\nexamines the content and makes informed decisions about what to write to\ndisk. That writer could then write the files to disk any way you like. In\nfact you could have it simply extract what data you are interested in and\nonly write that piece of information. For information about writing custom\nmodules refer to the developers manual on our website. It and the user\nmanual are quite comprehensive and should give you a clear idea of\nHeritrix&#39;s potential.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;4) are there reasonably well documented readers for us to review? it would\n&gt;help greatly to be able to run a crawling app, and then pass the reader\nover\n&gt;the returned information... this would allow a way to see how the overall\n&gt;apps actually function..\n\nI&#39;m unsure of the status of existing readers. But if you opt for the above\nidea you wouldn&#39;t need to bother with ARC files.\n\n&gt;another question...\n&gt;\n&gt;can the heritrix app be setup/configured to access sites that require a\n&gt;user/passwd in a manner similar to what i can do with a perl (LWP) app...??\n\nYes, credentials can be supplied for certain types of logins. This is\ncovered in the user manual.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;thanks for your time/patience...\n\nNo problem.\n\nRegards,\nKristinn Sigur�sson\nSoftware Engineer\nNational and University Library of Iceland\n\n&gt;\n&gt;bruce\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\nYahoo!
