The next day I recover that job, and continue with\n&gt; the crawl. I repeat this until the job has finished. &gt;\n&gt; If I create map of data/uri from the extractor, then I assume that\n&gt; data will be lost. So I need to somehow have it saved and reloaded\n&gt; when performing a checkpoint.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a plug-in way of doing this?\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; That might be tricky. Is checkpointing something to you can use?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
