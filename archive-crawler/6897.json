Call this the target URL.\n\nThen, verify that in a regular web browser you can click from the seed, \nthrough one or more other interim hop URLs that stay on the same \nhostname, to reach the target URL.\n\nIn this way, you&#39;re following the same steps as the crawler.\n\nThen look carefully at all the interim hop URLs, and ensure each is \nindividually followable by the crawler according to its rules.\n\nFor example, if the seed is URL A, and the target is URL D, and you have \nto click to URL B then URL C to go from A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D, pay close attention \nto B and C.\n\nPerhaps B is in your Heritrix crawl, but C is not. Then focus your \nattention on what&#39;s different about C. Is C on another hostname? Was C \nblocked by a robots.txt rule? Was it only followable due to something in \npage B (like Javascript- or Flash-heavy content) that might be hard for \nthe crawler to follow?\n\nUsually this makes evident exactly how the default scope should be \nbroadened to include what you intuitively think the &#39;site&#39; should be. \n(This process also works in reverse, to deduce the first &#39;hop&#39; where the \ncrawler gets something you didn&#39;t expect.)\n\nNow, it&#39;s not necessarily the case that it&#39;s even possible to reach D \nfrom A while staying on the same site. Many well-organized sites ensure \nthis, but sometimes only external links lead to &#39;islands&#39; of deeper \npages... and Google&#39;s global view is more likely to discover those.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/11/10 8:59 AM, Ewa Bartosiewicz wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m trying to do a crawl that is using the default configuration and is using only one site as a seed. I get some results and the crawl finishes correctly. When I use the google search with the option site:my_seed_site I get much more hits then using heritrix.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a way to explain this? Should I configure something differently then just the defaults?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your help!\n&gt; Ewa\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
