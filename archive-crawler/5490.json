But you can write \nan writer plugin for Heritrix, cop=\r\ny ARCWriterProcessor, without \nchange anything but the class name and addin=\r\ng a logger info into \nthe &quot;innerProcessResult&quot; method like:\n\nlogger.info(cu=\r\nri.toString() + &quot; ## and this URL get from: &quot; + \ncuri.getVia().toString() +=\r\n &quot;## and the path depth is: &quot; +  \ncuri.getPathFromSeed());\n\nSo it means cur=\r\nrent URL is &quot;curi&quot; and this URL is get \nfrom &quot;curi.getVia()&quot;. The format of=\r\n the path from seed is &quot;RLLL&quot;\n(R is seed and L means link), which means thi=\r\ns URL&#39;s depth from seed \nis 4.\n\nSo you can parse the logger file and get th=\r\ne info you want.\n\nHope this helps\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;alihoaliho&quot; &lt;alihoaliho@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; \n&gt; does anyone know if ther=\r\ne&#39;s a way to retrieve the seed url from a\n&gt; document in the ARC file.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nin other word, how to find out which original seed is a particular\n&gt; docume=\r\nnt in an ARC file was originated of. \n&gt; \n&gt; I am writing an application in w=\r\nhich I need to associate the\n&gt; downloaded webpages back to its seed. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\ni.e.\n&gt; \n&gt; seed 1 -&gt; {doc1, doc2, doc5...}\n&gt; seed 2 -&gt; {doc6, doc7, doc3...}=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
