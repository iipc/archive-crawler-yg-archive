The raw pages are\nsaved to files known as ARC files. One file has hundreds of pages.  The\ncutoff point is hit when the file is (configurable) 100M in size.  These\nARC files would then serve as input to a parser of your writing that\nwould extract the pages/info you&#39;re trying to harvest.  To parse the ARC\nfiles, you need a reader.  There are a few options outlined here:\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual.html#arcreader.\n\nAsk more questions.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;to be frank, we&#39;re looking for a solution that would allow us to not have\nto\n&gt;write unique perl scripts/parsers for each site!\n&gt;\n&gt;if there is someone who&#39;s familiar with this app that we could talk to, we\n&gt;would greatly appreciate a short conversation to get a better understanding\n&gt;of what the app does, and how it works.\n&gt;\n&gt;regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;bruce douglas\n&gt;bedouglas@...\n&gt;(925) 866-2790\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
