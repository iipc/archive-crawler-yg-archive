Since I tried unsuccessfuly\n&gt; running a script to create this job based on a recover.gz file (see\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2764), \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2764%29,&gt; Im now\n&gt; considering the checkpoint facility. \nWhat kind of issues did you run into Sam?\n\n&gt; I read somewhere in the user\n&gt; manual something about the checkpoint operation thru JMX, but I\n&gt; couldnt do it since theres no such operation. \nThere has to be a running job for you to see the CrawlJob MBean, the \nbean with the checkpoint operation.  Even still, its hard to find.  Look \nafter the long list of Attributes and you&#39;ll see:\n\n....\n startCheckpoint: Start a checkpoint\n  Parameters 0, return type=java.lang.Void\n...\n\n\nThe operation name is &#39;startCheckpoint&#39; and takes no arguments.\n\n\n&gt; Also theres the\n&gt; automated checkpointing by setting the\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.Checkpointer.period attribute at the\n&gt; heritrix.properties file. But it doesnt allow me to execute it after\n&gt; crawling has finished (and it wouldnt make any sense, I know). \n\nYou could set the pause-at-finish flag and then checkpoint (But if the \njob is done, when you recover, there&#39;ll be nothing to crawl.  Or are you \nintroducing new seeds on recovery?).\n\n&gt; So, is\n&gt; there any way to do it?\n&gt; Would it be easier to add &#39;recovery&#39; as a parameter for the operation\n&gt; addJobBasedOn in JMX?\nJust setting the recovery-path to point at checkpoint directory in the \norder file you submit should be all thats required.  Let us know if this \ndoesn&#39;t work for you.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
