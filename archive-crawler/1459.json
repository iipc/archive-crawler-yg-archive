If you are going to put my code in I should expand it and do it right.\n\n&gt;Being able to supply the &#39;referer&#39; [sic] header makes sense to me.   A\n&gt;quick googling has it that spiders don&#39;t often supply this header -- or\n&gt;if they do, its often with malicious intent to fill logs with spammed\n&gt;links -- but a referer is also useful to remote servers/administrators\n&gt;where the crawler is tripping over bad links.\n\nmy apache logs show that most (including google) do not include it.  I \nfigure the next bunch (or maybe some current) bad php scripts will use \nreferrer to decide what content to respond with.  At least that&#39;s the way \nI&#39;d do some of the things they are attempting to do with 500 character URL&#39;s\n\n&gt;A patch that disabled this feature by default but that allowed you to\n&gt;turn it on using an expert setting would be much appreciated.\n\nI&#39;ll clean it up and send it to sourceforge\n\n&gt;   I don&#39;t think you need worry about clashing with\n&gt;ATTR_ACCEPT_HEADER content. If operator wants to add a Referer header to\n&gt;the ATTR_ACCEPT_HEADER list, they can disable the automatic adding of\n&gt;referer feature.\n\nOK, that makes it simpler\n\n&gt;(Here&#39;s an issue to cover the work:\n&gt;https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102&func=detail&aid=1114133).\n&gt;St.Ack\n\n\n\nDave Skinner   dave at solid dot net\n    High Performance Programming---assembly (lots of them), C, java, perl\n    Database and Non-trivial web site implementations\n    Real-time and embedded systems are my specialty\n\n\n\n"}}
