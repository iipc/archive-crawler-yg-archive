I only re=\r\nmember I&#39;ve replaced the jmxremote.password\nwhere need and replaced @PASSWO=\r\nRD@ with letmein in those file.\n\nWhen I try, from command line, to launch h=\r\neritrix in this way, the\noutput is like the follow lines:\n\n&gt;- Login and pas=\r\nsword have not been specified (see --admin switch)\n&gt;- another program uses =\r\nthe port for the web UI (8080 by default)\n (e.g. another Heritrix instance)=\r\n\n&gt;- JMX password file is missing or permissions not set correctly\n\n&gt;Do you =\r\nwant to try to fix the permissions (Y/N)?\n\nWhen I choose Y, it returns this=\r\n second set of output:\n\n&gt;Restart Heritrix (Y/N)?Y\n&gt;WARNING: It&#39;s currently =\r\nnot possible to run Heritrix in background  \n     &gt;on Windows. It was just =\r\nstarted minimized in a new Window and\nwill be &gt;shut down as soon as you log=\r\n off.\n\n&gt;Either fixing the permissions failed or there was another problem.\n=\r\n&gt;You may have to set the ownership of the file \n&gt;&#92;Programmi&#92;Java&#92;heritrix-1=\r\n.12.0&#92;jmxremote.password\n&gt;manually to yourself (%USERNAME%) and restrict th=\r\ne access to &gt;read-only.\n\nwhere %USERNAME% is my username in windows account=\r\n.\n\nI&#39;ve read the FAQ and all the correlated articles\n(http://www.cip.ifi.lm=\r\nu.de/~schoefma/howto/run_heritrix_on_windows/\nfor example).\n\nI also tried t=\r\no modify permission in all the way. \nWhat&#39;s wrong?
