I know that some\nprojects have (and are probably still) probing for whether a site\ngives such &#39;soft 404s&#39; by requesting a random path URL on the host,\nand seeing if a 200 comes back. Presumably they could also use the\ncontent of that page as a hint to detect other &#39;soft 404s&#39; on the\nsite. (Though, many of these situations are caused by scripts that\naffect only part of the URL space, not the whole site.)\n\nLet us know if you come up with anything good!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nAdam Fisk wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering how you guys would recommend ignoring the common case\n&gt; where a server returns a 200-level response code at the *http* level,\n&gt; but visually displays a &quot;404 File Not Found&quot; in the returned html.\n&gt; \n&gt; Should I go ahead and write a custom Filter that looks for 404s in the\n&gt; html itself?
