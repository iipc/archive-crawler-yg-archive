It\n&gt;  does not currently read CDX files because I have no way of creating\n&gt;  one that I can code against. However, once (if) I add this\n&gt;  capability then I will not have to scan the archive file to find its\n&gt;  members because the relevant information can be read from the CDX.\n&gt;\n&gt;- You can get an iterator to walk over the contents of the ARC file\n&gt;  member by member (or record by record, to use the ARCReader\n&gt;  terminology). You can specify a content type to limit the types of\n&gt;  members you see: text/*, text/html, image/jpeg, etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;- You can access the information in the URL record and the response\n&gt;  headers from the HTTP server.\n&gt;\n&gt;- You can access the member&#39;s data in a single call.\n&gt;\n&gt;- The code currently works on Mac OS X and RedHat Linux 7.3 on x86\n&gt;  systems. Before I release I am going to build at least on Fedora\n&gt;  Core 1 (I don&#39;t have FC2 installed anywhere), SuSE 64-bit on an\n&gt;  Opteron, and SPARC/Solaris using the Sun compilers, and probably\n&gt;  Windows under VC++ 7.0 and Cygwin. Suffice it to say the code is\n&gt;  portable. It relies on the Zlib library to handle the decompression.\n&gt;\n&gt;That should be a suitable feature set to get some use out of\n&gt;it. Moving forward I&#39;m planning to add the following:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Support for the generation of CDX files, using printf-style format\n&gt;  strings.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Support for generating DAT files.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Support for treating an entire directory of .ARC files as one\n&gt;  logical ARC, allowing you to transparently iterate over all\n&gt;  elements.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Support for arbitrary predicates when selecting members with the\n&gt;  iterator. For example, you could just iterate over all text/html\n&gt;  files that had an HTTP response status code of 200, thereby avoiding\n&gt;  the HTML error pages that sites fondly generate now. Or you could\n&gt;  iterate over all GIFs (image/gif) and only return those that are\n&gt;  animated or are larger or smaller than a given dimension.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Support for regular expression based filters.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Support for inserting filters between the data contained in raw\n&gt;  response and the data returned by the iterator. For example, you\n&gt;  could extract the text from a PDF file.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Python bindings.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Support for database integration --- via a class abstraction, with\n&gt;  initial support for the native MySQL C API.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Whatever else people suggest.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
