However, to efficiently update a crawl run, I&#39;d\nlike to use some of the HTTP/1.1 features \n(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).\n\nIn particular, I am interested in using the ETag\nresponse(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-\nsec14.html#sec14.19)\ntogether with If-None-Match \n(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.25)\nand If-Modified-Since (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-\nsec14.html#sec14.25).\n\nThe basic idea would be, to store the ETag and the date of a\nfetched URL. In the next crawl I would only fetch urls that\nhave changed.\n\nAm I missing something here, or are there implied\ndisadvantages to use HTTP/1.1 and to use that approach?\n\nOr is there another mechanism to efficiently update a crawl\nthat I have missed?\n\nOr does someone know another java crawler that uses HTTP/1.1?\n\nMichael\n\n\n\n"}}
