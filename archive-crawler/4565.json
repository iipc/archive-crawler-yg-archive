All out-of-scope links will be \nlogged to the org.archive.crawler.postprocessor.LinksScoper.log file \nwithin the *logs* directory.  Be sure that all other logging \ncharacteristics in the heritrix.properties are set to your needs.\n\nKeep in mind that this list will probably grow very large with a lot of \nduplicate entires. If you want to reduce the logging output see \nscope-rejected-url-rules within LinksScoper. For example, you can add \nregex decide rule like ^.*&#92;.jpg$  and only URLs that that are \nout-of-scope and end with .jpg will be logged.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\ngoblin_cz wrote:\n&gt; Hallo, I&#39;ve got a question..\n&gt; \n&gt; How to log every link that haven&#39;t been downloaded in a crawl? The\n&gt; reason why is important too.\n&gt; I&#39;m download only sites that ends with .cz, but we are developing a\n&gt; decide rule, that can make a decision whether the page is useful for\n&gt; czech archive (based on some country settings, language recognition\n&gt; and so on). So the plan is: make a crawl of whole czech domains (380k\n&gt; 2.level domains) and catch every link that is out of scope and than\n&gt; make crawl with the czech decide rule with catched links as seeds.\n&gt; Another reasons logging is useful too (deduplicator, quota enforcer,\n&gt; regexp,...)\n&gt; \n&gt; And is possible to override logger settings for LinkScoper? (count,\n&gt; file location,..)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a lot for answers,\n&gt; \n&gt; Adam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
