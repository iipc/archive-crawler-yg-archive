But I am trying to give some hints for\nyour =\r\nquestion. Hope it helps. \n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shrijee=\r\nt_paliwal&quot;\n&lt;shrijeet.paliwal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Things that I need to do,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 1. I want to use Heritrix embedded in my application.\nHeritrix is absolute=\r\nly a sophisticated crawler I have ever seen. I\nmean there are powerful filt=\r\ner rules and processors you can use to\ncustom it.\n \n&gt; 2. I just want text a=\r\nnd HTML content.\nMaybe some NLP tools are what you need. See rapidminer(for=\r\nmerly yale)\ntext plugin(http://rapid-i.com/content/view/55/85/) which can d=\r\no html\ntag stripping, stopword, and stemming and so on. You can define a\npr=\r\nocess to extract what you want. \n\n&gt; 3. I will use the crawled data for text=\r\n mining purpose and not for\n&gt; displaying results or do any search on it. \na=\r\ns i say above, rapidminer is for text mining and have a nice gui.\nmaybe u c=\r\nan check it out.\n\n&gt; 4. For #3 reason I wish to clean the content coming in =\r\npages as much\n&gt; as possible (read NO HTML/Style/Java Script tags present).\n=\r\nas i said for #2\n\n&gt; 5. Finally I wish to write files on disk in a custom fo=\r\nrmat which goes\n&gt; like this: \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;article&gt;\n&gt; &lt;url&gt;www.example.org&lt;/url&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;title&gt;example.org rocks&lt;/title&gt;\n&gt; &lt;content&gt;\n&gt; blah blah blah I removed al=\r\nl tags yay.\n&gt; &lt;/content&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/article&gt;\n&gt;\nI have no idea what the current def=\r\nault ARC file looks like. There is\na ARC file spec you can check. If that d=\r\non&#39;t meet ur needs, just write\na custom writer to do anything u want.\n \n&gt; H=\r\nere each article would be a page of the source I am crawling. So my\n&gt; quest=\r\nion is do I need my custom writer for this purpose? I read in the\n&gt; group a=\r\nnd discovered that the parsing of content can be costly affair\n&gt; if done wh=\r\nile crawling. But if I download all the content and then\n&gt; start converting=\r\n into custom format I fear I will need more work in\n&gt; reading the content i=\r\nn meaningful manner and sorting out articles.\n&gt; Also can some one comment o=\r\nn the XML write that Heritrix comes with,\n&gt; what is the purpose? Any other =\r\ninputs will be deeply appreciated. I am\n&gt; still in design stage so I can re=\r\nplan the whole thing if some one\n&gt; comes with a great idea.\n&gt;\n\nregards,\nyan=\r\nky\n\n\n"}}
