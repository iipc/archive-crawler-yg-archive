I \nunderstand =\r\nthat a process method is required that gets a passed in \nCrawl URI.  Does t=\r\nhe script require a main method or a specific class \nname?\n\nSpecifically, I=\r\n&#39;d like to place it between the Precondition enforcer \nand the fetchers so =\r\nI can allow specific folders to be ignored from \nrobots.txt.  i.e. I&#39;d like=\r\n to change the status of a CrawlURI from -\n9998 to an &quot;accept&quot; code only if=\r\n it is in a specific path to all an \nimages folder that is in robots.txt to=\r\n still be crawled.\n\nBy chance does anyone have an example beanshell script =\r\nthat would do \nthis?\n\nThanks\nAdam T.\n\n\n\n"}}
