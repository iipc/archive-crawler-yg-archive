I am calling Heritrix.main(args..) to start\ncr=\r\nawling. My application can start multiple crawling. I want to\ncontrol the c=\r\nrawling through my application. I may choose any single\ncrawling task to be=\r\n stop. I can get the all instance of Heritrix using\nits getInstance() metho=\r\nd. But how can I differentiate between heritrix\ntwo objects. I gave a diffe=\r\nrent name for Heritrix instance. But there\nis not any mehod getName() to id=\r\nentify a particular heritrix object.\n\nThanks\n\n\n"}}
