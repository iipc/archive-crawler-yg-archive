As everything seemed to start and run fine \nwithout errors, I hadn&#39;t thought it was a classpath problem.\n\nBut, having started a fresh directory, just putting in the jars I \nabsolutely needed and generally tidying up, and running directly from \na proxy-friendly-updated heritrix-1.0.4.jar, the problem seems to \nhave been resolved - at least, I now have a crawl running happily \ninto the thousands.\n\nSchoolboy error on my part, although slightly worrying at \nhow &#39;silent&#39; the problem was. Thanks again, though,\n\nJim\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Niklas Vargensten wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Hey, I had the same problem a while back. No data, except for DNS. \n&gt; &gt;In my case it seemed to depend on my putting some additional .jar \nfiles in the \n&gt; &gt;heritrix directory, and as the heritrix startup script includes \nall jars with \n&gt; &gt;($HERITRIX_HOME)/*.jar in addition to ($HERITRIX_HOME)/lib/*.jar \nwhen \n&gt; &gt;running, it got \n&gt; &gt;confused, somehow (probably because my jar files contained some \nlibs used by \n&gt; &gt;heritrix). \n&gt; &gt;It seemed really strange, but I tried everything, and \n&gt; &gt;the problem was not solved until I moved my jar files to another \ndirectory. I \n&gt; &gt;can&#39;t really tell if that was really it, but heritrix has worked \nperfect \n&gt; &gt;since then, anyway.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This was just a wildcard, but if this is the case for you too, the \nstartup \n&gt; &gt;script would really be in need of a re-write...\n&gt; &gt;/ Niklas\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Thanks Niklas for jumping in.\n&gt; \n&gt; The heritrix.jar needs to be found before any of the supporting \njars \n&gt; because it overlays classes from the httpclient jar. \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking back though the list, others have reported a problem \nsimilar to \n&gt; Jim&#39;s fixed by rejiggling the classpath:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/772\n&gt; \n&gt; We have yet to do a windows start script.  Technically its an \n&gt; unsupported platform but it seems like experience has it that it \n&gt; generally works for people.  If anyone wants to donate a windows \nstart \n&gt; script, I can add it in.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;On Wednesday 20 October 2004 16.37, jkilleen74 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;m running Heritrix 1.0.4 on a PC (Windows XP); I&#39;m having a \nproblem\n&gt; &gt;&gt;where any crawl jobs seem to start fine - retrieve the DNS and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;robots.txt as appropriate, redirect as appropriate etc. But once \nthey\n&gt; &gt;&gt;hit an actual page e.g. somewebsite/index.html, the crawl comes \nto an\n&gt; &gt;&gt;end. It&#39;s as if the page contained no data or links, yet I know \nthis\n&gt; &gt;&gt;is not the case (I can browse to it through IE perfectly \nnormally.)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;In my crawl.log, I see something like the following e.g.:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;20041020142929438     1         62 dns:www.st-andrews.ac.uk P\n&gt; &gt;&gt;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study.shtml text/dns #000 0 - -\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;20041020142930190   404          0 http://www.st-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;andrews.ac.uk/robots.txt P http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study.shtml\n&gt; &gt;&gt;text/html #000 251 - -\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;20041020142931601   200          0 http://www.st-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;andrews.ac.uk/study.shtml - - text/html #000 142 - 3t\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Note the figures in the second column, for amount of data \ndownloaded.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;For the front page (study.shtml), it seems to have downloaded zero\n&gt; &gt;&gt;data. Yet the crawl completes without any obvious errors or \nalerts -\n&gt; &gt;&gt;it seems to have found this front page, then decided that not only\n&gt; &gt;&gt;are there no links to follow, but not even any data to retrieve. \nThe\n&gt; &gt;&gt;same pattern is seen whether I respect or ignore robots.txt, for \nany\n&gt; &gt;&gt;number of sites I&#39;ve tried to examine so far. I&#39;m not applying any\n&gt; &gt;&gt;unusual filters, just a standard crawl.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;m running this behind a firewall, so am using the Proxy server\n&gt; &gt;&gt;patch proved a while back, which seems to be working (without it, \nany\n&gt; &gt;&gt;crawl job just stalled on the very first step.)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I&#39;m probably missing something obvious, but any suggestions\n&gt; &gt;&gt;appreciated!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Jim K\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Yahoo!
