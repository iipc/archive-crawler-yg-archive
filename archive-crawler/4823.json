We are  \n&gt; wor=\r\nking with an outside partner to fully document the 2.0 JMX  \n&gt; interface; t=\r\nhat documentation project should be done by the end of  \n&gt; January.\n\nCould =\r\nyou do that as well with 1.12? I thought there was a JMX Bean\ninterface for=\r\n Heritrix that would allow it to access order.xml files.\n\n&gt; But the Heritri=\r\nx 2.0 engine does not keep an internal list of  \n&gt; available crawlers, and =\r\nso cannot automatically select a non-busy  \n&gt; crawler to launch a new job i=\r\nn. I believe this is the only hcc  \n&gt; feature missing from the engine, thou=\r\ngh I haven&#39;t done a thorough  \n&gt; analysis.\n\nAre you planning on implementin=\r\ng a cluster monitor? Something that\nwill distribute jobs to all the crawler=\r\ns?\n\n&gt; We do plan to support hcc or hcc-like features in 2.0, but wanted to =\r\n \n&gt; release the crawler/webui first. We have no timeframe for hcc  \n\nCool! =\r\nCan you give an example of some of those features.\n\nI didn&#39;t know you guys =\r\nwere going in that direction, and implemented\nmy own cluster monitor.\n\nI im=\r\nplemented my own cluster setup using XML-RPC. I didn&#39;t want to use\nJMX beca=\r\nuse I wanted to keep it lightweight, and deploy the crawlers\nvia WebStart.\n=\r\n\nStill, I think you JMX implementation might be better.\n\n\n"}}
