Yes, I&#39;m s=\r\nure that I&#39;m using the same Sun Java.  However, the oddest thing happened: =\r\n I just kept on beating my head against the same old stone wall - and event=\r\nually the harder (and less brittle) object won, and I just popped through t=\r\nhe wall.  I kept trying to run a crawl, and eventually SOMEHOW some script =\r\nmust have figured out where some resources were.  It just started working, =\r\nand I cannot replicate the problem.\n\nAll the control functions started to w=\r\nork after my &quot;magic hard-head breakthrough&quot; and I don&#39;t have the faintest c=\r\nlue as to WHY.  I&#39;m guessing that some library function found where a neede=\r\nd resource was hiding under 9.04.  Either that, or it was a combination of =\r\nthe phase of the moon, my zodiac sign and my father&#39;s shoe size.\n\nAll I kno=\r\nw is it works, and now it won&#39;t fail.\n\nRich (the confused) Bowser\n\n\n\n"}}
