I had to authenticate every time I submittted a \nform and then it&#39;d NPE more often than it&#39;d work.  Whats up w/ 2.0.x?  \nIs it being used by anyone?\n\nWas also wondering about the move to Apache-licensing project that was \ntalked of a while back up on the list?\n\nThanks,\nSt.Ack\n\nJean-NoÃ«l Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using Heritrix 2.0.1. &lt;http://2.0.1.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I created a sheet that is associated to www.example.com \n&gt; &lt;http://www.example.com&gt;. This sheet has its own root, root:scope, and \n&gt; root:scope:deciderules sequence. However everytime I launch the crawl, \n&gt; it seems like only the settings from the global sheet are used... Eg, \n&gt; if I have there a single RejectRule, the crawl instantly stops.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my experience, Heritrix is awesome as a crawl engine, but \n&gt; configuration is completely buggy. Not only does the web GUI is not \n&gt; very convenient, but so far I have had troubles with it almost \n&gt; everytime I try to use a different sheet than the global one... the \n&gt; only way to achieve something is to use the global one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Am I missing something or should I report a bug? (I already reported \n&gt; several related to the configuration interface)\n&gt;\n&gt; Jean-Noel\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: and trying to mix rules from the global sheet and another sheet is \n&gt; a nightmare, moving them up and down always fail because it seems the \n&gt; indexes are not maintained correctly. This is probably actually not \n&gt; supported.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
