I am a new member in the group, and I have\nbeen using the Heritrix software for some time now. \n\nI have a question:\n\nAssuming that I have a list of seeds (eg.100 seeds), and I want to\ndownload the pages that are 1 level after these seeds, and not the\nactuals seeds. Is there any specific comination of Link hops and or\nTrans hops I need to follow?\n\nAs I am not interested in having an extra 100 pages (the seeds) that\nare  causing a problem to the quality of the actual download, I want\nto use them as a mere start point from which the Heritrix, should\ndownload the pages that come from the links within each seed.\n\nThank you in advance\n\n:) \n\n\n\n"}}
