Is this a bad time to try the codebase \n&gt;&gt;out, or, with a current example of the order.xml file, should I be able \n&gt;&gt;to run a crawl from the CVS code? \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes.  That is a fair assessment.  The code is in flux at the moment \n&gt; (We&#39;re redoing configuration and adding a UI).  Give us a week or two.  \n&gt; We&#39;re also currently working on the packaging.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to try and persevere -- and it looks like you&#39;ve gotten far \n&gt; already going by your feedback above -- the order and seed files under \n&gt; dev-crawl are pretty current.
