It\nhas also been extensively reviewed by Netarkivet.dk (my thanks) du=\r\nring the\nsame period. It is believed to be entirely stable, however support=\r\n for Etags\nis limited.\n\nThe DeDuplicator is a add-on module for Heritrix th=\r\nat allows sequential\nsnapshot crawl to leverage information about previous =\r\niterations to avoid\nstoring (or even downloading) duplicate data. You will =\r\nneed a working\nHeritrix installation to use it. It has been tested under He=\r\nritrix 1.8.0 and\n1.10.0 but is believed to also work under older versions.\n=\r\n\nThis is accomplished by building an index between snapshots. This index is=\r\n\nthen queried at crawl time to determine if crawled documents remain\nunchan=\r\nged. \n\nTesting has revealed that for moderately sized crawls (on good hardw=\r\nare) of\nroughly 1-2 million documents the performance penalty in negligible=\r\n. For\nlarger crawls it is recommended that only non-text documents be index=\r\ned (as\nthey are far more likely to not change and represent a disproportion=\r\nate\namount of the data collected).\n\nTo avoid downloading unchanged document=\r\ns a substitute FetchHTTP processor is\nincluded that used &#39;last-modified&#39; in=\r\nformation to base its decision upon.\nNote that this is not foolproof and ma=\r\ny cause you to miss valid content.\nNote also that this should never be appl=\r\nied to documents that may contain\nlinks.\n\nA guide for getting started is av=\r\nailable on the website. \n\nDeDuplicator site: http://vefsofnun.bok.hi.is/ded=\r\nuplicator/index.html\n\nWith best regards,\nKristinn Sigur=F0sson\nIT-Group Pro=\r\nject Manager\nThe National and University Library of Iceland\nArngrimsgata 3\n=\r\n107 Reykjavik\nE-mail: kristsi@...\n\n\n\n"}}
