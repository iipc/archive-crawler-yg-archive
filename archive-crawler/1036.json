Looking at the source code, I see a lot of\nstatic fields in Heretrix.java that need to be initialized in ways\nthat are only accessible from the outside from the main() method.\n\nI think Heretrix would be more flexible if these static configuration\nparameters were in a single instance, or better yet, behind an\ninterface that outsiders (like myself) could implement.\n\nJust an idea.  What do you think?\n\n\n"}}
