Each instance giving different set of urls.  But 70% of urls\n&gt; are same.  I need both crawlers need to give same set of urls.  If\n&gt; there any option in Heritrix like whenever we crawl a site it will\n&gt; always give same set of urls.  \n\nTwo crawlers, given the exact same seeds and initial configuration, \nstarted at the exact same time, should get the same material EXCEPT in \ncases where the network and sites themselves vary from moment to moment \nor client to client.\n\nFor example, sites might randomize their content on certain pages, give \ndifferent answers to different IP addresses, have intermittent errors, \nand so forth. Even the slight jitter in successful fetch delays could \nmean that on one run, a URI is discovered once via one path, and then on \nthe other crawl, via another path. (And because Heritrix sends a \n&#39;Referer&#39; value, the sites themselves may again choose to answer these \narrivals via different paths differently.)\n\nSo even though the Heritrix software itself is deterministic, the \ninternet it collects is not. You would have to analyze your logs and \ncollected material to find the initial points of divergence.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
