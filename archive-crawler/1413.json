(hopefully then the os would\n&gt; know that you are serious about wanting a file)  then try to create \n&gt; another\n&gt; file assuming that the first file is a directory....   I *think* that is\n&gt; similar to what I had done with java 1.4 and it failed reliably.  but I\n&gt; lost what I had done when I update my local copy from head and \n&gt; switched to\n&gt; java 1.5.  I created the disktest stuff in /tmp assuming it would be \n&gt; OK to\n&gt; leave any left over wreckage from the test there.  I get nervous about\n&gt; creating crud in either /proc or /dev.\n&gt;\n&gt; hmmm.  just wondered if a way to get the failure would be to create a\n&gt; directory and then treat the directory as if it were a file to get the\n&gt; error....  I guess I should go look at the code.  but this is not the \n&gt; most\n&gt; important bug on my list today.  Somehow I doubt that it is high on\n&gt; anyone&#39;s list.\n\nNice idea.
