Hardest thing would be making the UI work with other \n&gt; than one job at a time.  If UI wasn&#39;t needed, there&#39;d be some wrestling \n&gt; initially to make sure each crawl had its own config. and didn&#39;t share \n&gt; resources, but thereafter, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to get it going.\n\nNo, not a single instance.\n\nRight now I have n copies of the heritrix distribution, each one\nstarted in its own instance with its own port and authentication\ninformation.\n\nRather than do this, I&#39;d like to have a single copy of the\ndistribution, which I start in n separate JVM instances, but\nconfigured completely by the properties file. In particular the\nlocation of the jobs directory for each one needs to be set.\n\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
