So\nany &#39;broader&#39; crawls will strain resources more than\n&#39;narrower&#39; ones with a smaller or fixed number of hosts\nof interest.\n\nYour machine may be swapping heavily. Things to check:\n\n  - Does &#39;top&#39; show swap in use?\n  - How does your configured max heap and current heap size\n    compare with RAM? (Max heap should be 25% or more smaller\n  - Do the &#39;si&#39; and &#39;so&#39; columns in &#39;vmstat 2&#39;\n    (sample every 2 seconds) show activity?\n\nSeparately from OS virtual memory, the new BDB/soft-reference\nmechanism for &#39;paging&#39; per-host/per-queue data out when not in\nimmediate use could theoretically reach some excessive IO states\nin low-memory conditions. This would be more likely if you weren&#39;t\nusing the &#39;hold-queues&#39; setting and were instead round-robinning\namong all queues in a big crawl.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\njoehung302 wrote:\n&gt; I started a crawl about a week ago (using 1.4 broad scope and the \n&gt; default BdbFrontier). So far I&#39;ve collected &gt;7 million docs but IO is \n&gt; consistently at &gt;50% using top. Sometimes even higher at 90+%.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is what&#39;s interesting...even if I pause the crawl, IO is still \n&gt; busy. The number never dropped.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m running on a dual Xeon with a direct attached SCSI array, using \n&gt; Sun&#39;s JDK 1.4.2. -Xmx1200.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve done a 7 million docs crawl using 1.0.4 before on the same \n&gt; hardware (using domainscope though). From what I remember the disk IO \n&gt; was at around 5%. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is it becuase of BdbFrontier? Any hints?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; -joe\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
