Are you asking how to reuse the \nsame seeds in every job?  If so, as part of creating a job, you specify \nthe seeds to use usually by having the order.xml point to a seeds.txt \nfile, the very file that was used in all previous crawls.  With JMX you \ncan pass paths to the order and seed file to use or pass seeds as a \nstring or pass a jar file that has the order and seeds as well as any \nsettings overrides (The latter makes it easier posting jobs to a remote \nHeritrix instance).\n&gt; Should the program itself control the seeds for each &quot;reusable&quot; job?\n&gt; or there is a simpler way?\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, when you say &quot;Automated rescheduling of jobs is not part of\n&gt; the crawler.&quot;, is because it should not be part of the crawler? \nThats what I think.  Keeps things modular and our options open.  \nScheduler can then be as simple as a cron job invoking heritrix \ncommand-line arguments or as sophisticated as quartz \n(http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/) invoking Heritrix via JMX as \noriginally suggested up on this list a while back \n(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1827).\n\n&gt; or\n&gt; could it be a new functionality for future releases? It the last was\n&gt; true, maybe I could work on that, but I don&#39;t know yet, because we are\n&gt; studying the best way to implement the reusability of jobs, and one of\n&gt; the alternatives is modifying Heritrix code.\nFor sure it could be part of a future Heritrix and we&#39;d welcome any \nscheduling contribution.\n\nFor our archive-it service we have a basic scheduler that lets you start \na job at defined coarse intervals (Once a day, once a week, etc.).  This \n&#39;scheduling&#39; is built into the application that manages all of the \nHertrice instances each running distinct crawl jobs.  It does this via \nthe hcc Heritrix subproject: http://crawler.archive.org/hcc/ (hcc is \nbeginnings of a &#39;Heritrix Cluster Controller&#39;, an application that can \ngive a view onto a cluster of Heritrix crawlers).  If hcc had a built-in \nscheduler, our archive-it would likely use it. If it was part of hcc, so \ncould others.\n\nMyself, I don&#39;t see much value in adding a scheduler to Heritrix itself: \nAnother heavy jar, multiple specification screens if the scheduler is of \nany sophistication at all, and a new place on disk to worry about  for \npersisted schedules.  I&#39;d be more interested in an external scheduler \nthat is able to schedule multiple instances being part of a separate \ncluster-management application but perhaps others see value in building \nscheduling into Heritrix itself?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks very much,\n&gt;\n&gt; tizo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; tizo_trico wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi there,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any way to reuse a job after it has finished?
