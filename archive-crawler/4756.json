If there are answers posted somewhere (i.e. a Wiki) please\ndirect =\r\nme there, but the Wiki on the Heritrix website didn&#39;t seem to\nprovide the a=\r\nnswers I&#39;m looking for.\n\n1) How can you control the page request speed of H=\r\neritrix. I performed\none crawl that was requesting HTML pages from a server=\r\n at 1.1 page per\nsecond. Which I think is to heavy a load on a web server.\n=\r\n\n2) I see in the finished crawler report stats on images (JPG, GIF,\netc. et=\r\nc). Is Heritrix downloading images while it&#39;s crawling, and if\nso how do I =\r\ndisable that.\n\n3) I&#39;m interested in archiving HTML that links to text files=\r\n of the\nextension &quot;.ms&quot;. How can I generate a report of HTML pages that\ncon=\r\ntain those links? I also want to archive those .MS files.\n\n4) Does anyone h=\r\nave Heritrix running on a network with multiple\nmachines working on the sam=\r\ne crawl job. Is this even possible?\n\n\n"}}
