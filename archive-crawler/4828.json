Further thought leads me to think that this is\nprobably not a real problem, but it will delay our upgrade to Heritrix\n2.\n\nThis may sound strange, but it also might be useful to define an\nalternative XML syntax for sheets. The translation would be very\nsimple, and would not need to happen in Heritrix itself. For instance:\n\n&lt;sheet&gt;\n  &lt;entry key=&quot;root&quot; type=&quot;map&quot; value=&quot;java.lang.Object&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;entry key=&quot;root:metadata&quot; type=&quot;primary&quot; value=&quot;org.archive.modules.writer.DefaultMetadataProvider&quot;/&gt;\n  […]\n&lt;/sheet&gt;\n\nThis is not a better syntax, but it could fit in with XML workflows.\n\n&gt; Nirvana for us would be an HTTPOpenMbeanJMXConnector -- you&#39;d\n&gt; specify operation parameters/attribute names in a POST-like payload,\n&gt; and you&#39;d get back XML or YAML or JSON with the results of the\n&gt; operation/ attribute value.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are projects out there that do this for &quot;standard&quot; MBeans, but\n&gt; not for OpenMBeans -- anything more complicated than a primitive\n&gt; value or String gets serialized and Base64 encoded, which is only\n&gt; useful if you have Java code as the client.\n&gt;\n&gt; But if an OpenMBeans-aware HTTP connector existed, we would gladly\n&gt; integrate it into the engine. Then people could more easily control\n&gt; Heritrix using widely available scripting languages like perl.\n&gt;\n&gt; I should mention that, unlike in 1.x, in 2.x anything that can\n&gt; happen in the Web UI can also happen over JMX. The Web UI now uses\n&gt; JMX exclusively to communicate with Heritrix.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a good thing. Initial impetus for development of\nan HTTP interface was to allow full control of Heritrix across the\nnetwork.\n\nPersonally, I still feel that JMX in general is a bit clunky, and that\nan HTTP interface which mimicked the JMX interface would be less than\nideal. For instance, I am note sure that a readFile (job, filename,\nsettingsPath, startPos, length) invocation, piped through a POST, is\nthe best way to get a crawl.log. I would much prefer a GET on\n&lt;http://example.org/jobs/20071211233637/crawl.log&gt;. Additionally, it\ndoesn’t appear to be possible to fetch the ARC files generated by a\ncrawl; indeed, JMX seems poorly disposed to handle the retrieval of\nlarge files in general.\n\n&gt; I really like this idea; would you mind filing a Feature Enhancement\n&gt; in JIRA?\n\nOk, done. &lt;http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1378&gt; I attached\na first approximation of a patch as well.\n\n&gt; The new method is good and bad. It doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to\n&gt; have to manually specify &quot;primary&quot; for a thing like CrawlController\n&gt; -- it&#39;s difficult to imagine needing more than one of those.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other hand, it&#39;s easy to imagine needing more than BDB\n&gt; environment. Assuming you had three separate disk drives, then you\n&gt; could specify one BDB environment for the settings system, one for\n&gt; the Frontier and one for the crawl history database. I think it made\n&gt; more sense to make all the modules behave the same (if you really\n&gt; want a second CrawlController -- perhaps some strange, customized\n&gt; subclass? -- the settings system won&#39;t stop you).\n\nThanks for your detailed explanation of this.\n\nbest,\nErik Hetzner\n;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Thu_Dec_13_11:34:24_2007-1\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Thu_Dec_13_11:34:24_2007-1--\r\n\n"}}
