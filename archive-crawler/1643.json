The time to delay is set\nby the Frontier &quot;retry-delay-seconds&quot; setting, and the maximum\nnumber of times an URL will be retriedis set by the &quot;max-retries&quot;\nsetting.\n\nThe delay is currently just a constant interval, though it has\noften been suggested to implement an exponentially-increasing delay\nin such a situation.\n\nSometimes these errors don&#39;t really have any chance to clear up,\nin which case you&#39;re just going to fail all &quot;max-retries&quot; times\nbefore moving to the next item in the queue. And, if the next\nitem in the queue involves a connection against the same host,\nwhich will simply fail again, you&#39;re just going to be in a loop\nof failures until the queue is exhausted or the operator loses\npatience.\n\nSo, setting this interval to be smaller could burden target hosts\nunfairly. Be careful.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nKristinn Sigurdsson wrote:\n&gt; Queues can be snoozed to enforce politeness (usually just a few \n&gt; seconds), this is controlled by the delay-factor, max-delay-ms \n&gt; and min-delay-ms settings on the Frontier.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Queues can also be snoozed if a _retryable error_ occurs (i.e. errors \n&gt; that may be caused by transient network issues, such as a server going \n&gt; down etc.) This usually results in snoozing a queue for several minutes \n&gt; 900 seconds (15 min) by default and is controlled by the \n&gt; retry-delay-seconds setting on the Frontier. The number of retries \n&gt; before it gives up is controlled by the max-retries setting.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt;  \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt; \n&gt;     -----Original Message-----\n&gt;     *From:* Christoph Spielmann [mailto:spielc@...]\n&gt;     *Sent:* 2. mars 2005 12:12\n&gt;     *To:* archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     *Subject:* Re: [archive-crawler] Snoozed Queue+wakeup time (continued)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     --- Christoph Spielmann &lt;spielc@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;      &gt; Hi everybody!\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I&#39;ve got another question (i know... again ;)):\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; If i understood it correctly everytime a exception\n&gt;      &gt; during the crawl is thrown, the crawler waits for a\n&gt;      &gt; given time before he continues the crawl. The\n&gt;      &gt; problem\n&gt;      &gt; is that it waits for about 15 minutes or something\n&gt;      &gt; like it, that&#39;s ways to long in my eyes... Now my\n&gt;      &gt; question is, where the setting for the duration of\n&gt;      &gt; the\n&gt;      &gt; timeout can be found and (hopefully) changed (if\n&gt;      &gt; there\n&gt;      &gt; is a setting for it at all...)\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;     Hmm i just remarked that i was wrong because i had a\n&gt;     queue snoozing but it still continued to crawl (i\n&gt;     guess it just stopped crawling last time cuz there was\n&gt;     nothing else to do...) but there&#39;s still a question\n&gt;     open: How is the &quot;sleep time&quot; calculated for a\n&gt;     snoozing queue cuz this time it snoozed for a few\n&gt;     seconds?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;          \n&gt;                \n&gt;     __________________________________\n&gt;     Celebrate Yahoo!&#39;s 10th Birthday!\n&gt;     Yahoo!
