And the various &quot;services&quot; like thumbshots  \nall feel kinda &quot;seedy&quot;,  I am always expecting to see advertisements  \nfor viagra stamped on top of the screenshots and other questionable  \nbusiness practices.\n\nIt seems like you should be able to have the pages be render inside of  \na library such as WebKit, but I guess rendering is very intertwined  \nwith monitor displays and resolutions etc.\n\nI have a research projects that aggregates info about people, events,  \nand organizations and I&#39;d love a better solution for linking in  \nscreenshots of the organizations and individuals site.  Here is an  \nexample using the thumbshot service for now..: http://www.hightechcville.com/organizations/318-worrell-water-technologies\n\nEric\n\n\n\nOn May 2, 2009, at 9:39 PM, Erik Hetzner wrote:\n\n&gt; At Thu, 30 Apr 2009 12:32:37 -0400,\n&gt; Eric Pugh wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Erik,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know this is off topic, but capturing an image of a website, I&#39;ve\n&gt;&gt; sued various tools like thumbshots.org etc, but never found a really\n&gt;&gt; good solution that wasn&#39;t cobbled through &quot;use x windows and special\n&gt;&gt; libraries and headless browser and X & W & Z tech&quot;...
