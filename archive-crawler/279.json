The reported bugs (I belive) have been\naddressed, but a few questions he posed have answers that may be useful to\neveryone.\n\nUpdated code is running on my site:\n\n http://parkert.com/crawlertest/\n\nOn Wed, 28 Jan 2004, stackarchiveorg wrote:\n\n|+ I added a crawler.  Its named heritrix too but had a different \n|version.  In drop down it only shows the crawler name, not version, so \n|its hard for me to distingush between the two.\n\nThis may be the first usability problem.  The app has a notion of a\ncrawler, which then has versions, i.e. a crawler Heritrix has versions 1\nand 2.  You were trying to treat a crawler as an entity with a version,\ni.e. there is a crawler Heritrix version 1.  Crawls are then started using\na specific version, or the latest if no version is specified.\n\nSorry, this is just slightly confusing, but makes data processing easier\n(like comparing versions of a crawler).\n\nIf you want to add a version of an existing crawler, like Heritrix 5.0,\nedit the crawler and add the version there.  You could get around this\nfunctionality by just creating a new crawler &quot;Heritrix v 5.0&quot; and most\neverything would work just fine, you just would not be able to use the\n&quot;view crawler results&quot; page to compare versions.\n\n|+ I see on disk and in your commit of last night that tests on the \n|filesystem are named &#39;test1&#39;, &#39;test3&#39; etc.  Do they have to be named \n|so?  Could they have more meaningful names so the &#39;background image \n|extraction&#39; test (test1) was  contained in a directory named \n|&#39;bkgrd_image_extraction&#39; or some such.\n\nNo, you can call them anything you like.  In the old version we used this \nnaming convention to make parsing apache logs easier and I just didn&#39;t \nbother to give them new names here.  But as we add new tests they can have \nany directory names you like.\n\n|+ Whats &#39;webroot&#39; in the &#39;Add Test&#39; page?\n\nwebroot is the name of the test&#39;s root directory, e.g. &#39;test1&#39;.  To add a\ntest you first dump a directory (e.g. newtest/) into\n&lt;crawlertesthome&gt;/tests/, then use the web form and specify a &#39;webroot&#39;\n(e.g. &#39;newtest&#39;).  \n\nRules are then defined relative to this root, so you might have a rule\n&quot;FIND hidden.html&quot; which would require that the crawler find\n&lt;crawlertesthome&gt;/tests/newtest/hidden.html.  Make sense?\n\nAlso, there is no requirement that all tests be directly under the test\nroot (&lt;crawlertesthome&gt;/tests/), so you can nest directories if it makes\nsense to organize tests hierarchically on the filesystem.\n\nOh, and I belive someone ask recently about instructions.  What exists can \nbe found here:\n\n  http://parkert.com/crawlertest/usageinstructions.txt\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or bug reports,\n\npt.\n--\nParker Thompson\nThe Internet Archive\n510.541.0125\n\n\n"}}
