Especially for host-based queuing, this could significantly\n&gt; improve performance. \n\nUsing HTTP/1.0 makes our life easier (smile).  The client doesn&#39;t need \nto worry about reconstituting the chunked responses. \n\nBut this feature has been asked for in the past -- recently even -- and \nthere&#39;s an issue to cover investigation of whats involved: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102&func=detail&aid=896805.  \nIt just hasn&#39;t been considered a priority.\n\n&gt; I also think that the current\n&gt; MultiThreadedConnectionManager does not make much sense if connections \n&gt; will\n&gt; not be reused anyway.\n\nYes. \n\nWe used to have a single-connection manager before the update to \nhttpclient 3.0.  I was under the impression that the MTCM did socket \nrecycling. This &#39;fact&#39; and issues I was having around delays on socket \nclose made me move to MTCM.  But then Gordon recently pointed out there \nseems to be no socket recycling going on.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Christian\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Christian Kohlschï¿½tter\n&gt; mailto: ck -at- NewsClub.de\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
