(From \nthe httpclient auth page &quot;... or can NTLM be used with HTTP 1.0 \nconnections or servers that do not support HTTP keep-alives.&quot;  See \nhttp://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/authentication.html#Proxy_Authentication).  \nCan you get access to the server logs?

However,\n&gt; my company uses proxy authentication (NTLM scheme) so I got connection\n&gt; refused problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve attempted to add the following: Put the proxy IP address, port,\n&gt; network user name and password in the order.xml file. These are then\n&gt; read by the FetchHTTP processor. In the innerProcess() method of this\n&gt; processor, I do the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; NTCredentials ntCredentials = new NTCredentials(login, pwd,\n&gt; myComputerName, domain);\n&gt; //where login and pwd are my network login and pwd taken from order.xml\n&gt; //myComputerName and domain are obtained from My Computer&#39;s\n&gt; Properties. I&#39;ve tried both short name for the computername and\n&gt; fullname (including the domain)\n&gt;\n&gt; AuthScope authscope = new AuthScope( host, Integer.parseInt(port),\n&gt; null, &quot;ntlm&quot;);\n&gt; //is null correct for realm here? I also tried to use domain instead\n&gt; of null but no luck\n&gt; //where host and port are taken from order.xml\n&gt; //then set proxy credentials\n&gt; this.http.getState().setProxyCredentials( authscope, ntCredentials);\n&gt;\n&gt; I then setDoAuthentication() to true.\n&gt;\n&gt; When running the application, I receive the following error:\n&gt; Failure authenticating with NTLM &lt;any realm&gt;@....x.x:xxxx\n&gt; Nov 23, 2006 5:37:30 PM org.archive.crawler.fetcher.FetchHTTP\n&gt; innerProcess\n&gt; INFO: GET http://www.abc.edu/ &lt;http://www.abc.edu/&gt; 407 4515 text/html\n&gt;\n&gt; --------\n&gt; The &quot;407&quot; status code means proxy authentication required. And the\n&gt; HTML page I received contains:\n&gt; The ISA Server requires authorization to fulfill the request. Access\n&gt; to the Web Proxy filter is denied. )Via: 1.1 PROXY1Proxy-\n&gt; Authenticate: NegotiateProxy-Authenticate: KerberosProxy-Authenticate:\n&gt; NTLM\n&gt; ---------\n&gt; Pls give me your suggestions on what I may have done wrong here?\n&gt; Any idea is highly appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
