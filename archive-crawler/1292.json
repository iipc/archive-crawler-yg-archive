So if all worker threads are busy with other\nURIs, no queues will be woken until a worker thread actually asks for a new\nURI to process. Also, while a job is paused, no wakes will occur. So the\nfrontier report of a pause HostQueuesFrontier crawl will often show negative\nwake times; those are queues that will wake as soon as the crawl is unpaused.\n\n(In the BdbFrontier, a background thread wakes queues, so even a paused\ncrawl will show queues moving from snoozed to ready in successive frontier\nreports. Only if that waking process has broken would you see more than\ntransitory/momentary negative wake times.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nTom Emerson wrote:\n&gt; Looking at the frontier report for a long running crawl, I see wake\n&gt; times on two of the queues of -3692ms and -3243ms.
