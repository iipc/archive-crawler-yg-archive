However, this new design does not bring real new fe=\r\natures. So I don&#39;t think that it would be wise to use it even though the ch=\r\nanges should be fully backward compatible. I am open for discussion on that=\r\n subject.\n\nAnyway, during this work, I noticed the HER-1787 issue on your J=\r\nira ( https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1787 ). Creating a git reposit=\r\nory for Heritrix should not be that hard and would really be helpful for fo=\r\ncusing the external community (ie outside &#39;Internet Archive&#39;). I clearly vo=\r\nte for it but don&#39;t want to create an account on your Jira just for that.\n\n=\r\nRegards\n\nBertrand Dechoux\n\n\n"}}
