Makes logs ~30% bigger than \nthen need to be.|\n|\n\n&gt;(2) Add a &quot;deferred.log&quot; which would capture problems that have\n&gt;     not yet resulted in success or failure -- for example,\n&gt;     a failure-to-connect that still has several retries left.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Currently, we don&#39;t necessarily see these until the CrawlURI\n&gt;     eventually succeeds or fails.\n&gt;\n&gt;     This log could be turned off. URIs could appear in this log\n&gt;     multiple times, and would also eventually appear in the\n&gt;     &#39;crawled&#39; or &#39;uncrawled&#39; logs as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSounds good.\n\n&gt;(3) Change not-fetched statuses from cryptic negative numbers to\n&gt;     text abbrieviations. Here are the proposed new abbrieviations.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Current New       Explanation\n&gt;      0      -         Unattempted\n&gt;     -1      E_NoDns   Domain Unresolvable\n&gt;     -2      E_NoConn  Connection Failed\n&gt;     -3      E_LostCo  Lost Connection\n&gt;     -4      E_SoTime  Socket Timeout\n&gt;     -5      E_JRtExc  Java RuntimeException\n&gt;     -6      E_Prereq  Prerequisite Unavailable\n&gt;     -7      E_BadUri  Unfetchable URI\n&gt;     -8      E_Retrys  Too Many Retries\n&gt;     -3000   E_JError  Java &#39;Error&#39;: Out of Memory or Stack Overflow\n&gt;     -50     D_Defer   Deferred (for now)\n&gt;     -9998   D_Robots  Disregarded due to Robots Directives\n&gt;     -4000   D_Chaff   Disregarded; considered chaff (infinite junk)\n&gt;     -4001   D_Links   Disregarded: Too Many Link Hops\n&gt;     -4002   D_Embed   Disregarded: Too Many Embed Hops\n&gt;     -5000   D_Scope   Disregarded: Out of Scope\n&gt;\n&gt;(Some of these statuses may no longer be used, or may only appear\n&gt;whn something has gone seriously wrong with normal URI processing.)\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\nYou make the result codes negative to distingush from the HTTP status \ncode returned?  Otherwise I&#39;d suggest reusing them (E.g: 408 Request \nTimeout  instead of  &quot;-4 E_SoTime Socket Timeout&quot;).  Otherwise,  +1.\n\n\n&gt;(4) Add a flexible &#39;annotation&#39; field way off to the right, so that\n&gt;     other notable conditions can be tagged on.\n&gt;\n&gt;     For example, when we give up because a document takes too long\n&gt;     or is too long, it&#39;s still a &quot;200 OK&quot; and a successful fetch,\n&gt;     but we must mark that it&#39;s truncated somewhere.\n&gt;\n&gt;     This will be the last field of the crawled/uncrawled/deferred\n&gt;     log, and consiste of a comma-separated list of tokens accumulated\n&gt;     from multiple previous Processor instances.\n&gt;\n&gt;     For example,\n&gt;\n&gt;       2t,sizeTrunc,noarchive\n&gt;\n&gt;     ...might indicate that 2 tries were necessary before success, the\n&gt;     resource was truncated as exceeding size limits, and a &#39;noarchive&#39;\n&gt;     directive was discovered by the HTML extractor.\n&gt;\n&gt;(5) Reordering & reformatting of line contents. The &quot;second line&quot; of\n&gt;     hops-to and &#39;via URI&#39; information will be folded into a single line.\n&gt;     Fields will be reordered to place the most important info to the left\n&gt;     and adjacent. Field order will be:\n&gt;\n&gt;[timestamp] [len] [status] [URI] [mime] [thread-no] [fetch-time] [path-to] [via-URI] [annotations]\n&gt;\n&gt;Any suggestions before this is enacted?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nAll sounds good.\n\nDo we have any reporting tools to go against our logs?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;- Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
