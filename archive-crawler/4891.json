If you want to use \n1.12.1 out-of-box then you can do this with a beanshell processor which \nwill limit your solutions.\n\n\nIf you decide to use beanshell processor, add it after the link scoper.\nThis processor can check all outlinks and if they are slash pages (e.g \nhttp://example.pt/ or http://example.pt:8080/), replaced them with new \ncandidate URIs created as seeds with empty hop path and no via.\nIf they don&#39;t match a slash page pattern, then create slash pages as \nseeds (same as above) and add them to the outlinks ((e.g \nhttp://example.pt/dir/ yields http://example.pt/)).\n\nIt is not pretty but it should work.\n\nSome methods and constructors that might help:\n\n- CrawlURI getOutCandidates()\n- CrawlURI replaceOutlinks()\n- CandidateURI(UURI u, String pathFromSeed, UURI via, CharSequence \nviaContext)\n- CandidateURI setIsSeed\n- Simple beanshell script that would print all processed uris may look like:\n----------------\nimport org.archive.crawler.datamodel.CrawlURI\n\nprocess(CrawlURI curi) {\n\tSystem.out.println(curi.getCrawlURIString());\n}\n-----------\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nTake care\ni.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Hi everyone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Portugal is now beginning its national web archiving initiative with \n&gt; project Tomba at FCCN (National\n&gt; Foundation for Scientific Computing).\n&gt; \n&gt; We are now beggining to use Heritirx 1.12.1 and we would appreciate some \n&gt; hints on how to configure Heritrix for our purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; We would like to crawl:\n&gt; \n&gt; - All the sites referenced by the seeds until a maximum number of 3 hops \n&gt; in a breadth first fashion, including seeds from several domains plus,\n&gt; - All the sites hosted on the .PT domain newly found during the crawl, \n&gt; (not part of the seeds), until a maximum number of 3 hops in a breadth \n&gt; first fashion counting from the home page of the site. If the hops \n&gt; counting would begin on a landing page different from the home page of \n&gt; the new site it is also ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; We tried to configure max-hops, max-trans-hops and max-speculative-hops \n&gt; but this are all counted from the seeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Basically, we would like that the counting of hops would be reset \n&gt; everytime we visit a new site, independently from it is a seed or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you please help us?\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
