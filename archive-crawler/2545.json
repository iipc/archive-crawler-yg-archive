If not, you might want to\n&gt; consider\n&gt;  &gt; it particularly since you&#39;re crawling big.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would regular checkpointing help the crawl in addition to be able to\n&gt; recovery? If that&#39;s the case I would consider doing fast checkpoint\n&gt; more often.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there a document where I can read on how to recover from fast\n&gt; checkpoint?\n&gt; \n\nSee http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#checkpoint.\n\n\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Are you saying that under the checkpoint directory, there was no\n&gt;  &gt; directory named bdbje-logs that we were filling with the *.jdb\n&gt; bdbje log\n&gt;  &gt; content from the job state directory?  In future you might take a\n&gt;  &gt; threaddump or two to get a clue as to where the crawler is stuck.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll send you the kill -3 thread dump offline. From the thread\n&gt; reports nothing got stuck.\n&gt; \n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n&gt;  &gt; So the &#39;Cursor has been closed&#39; and the OOMEs (assuming the top\n&gt; listed\n&gt;  &gt; SEVEREs are OOMEs) look to be fairly concurrent.  The &#39;Cursor&#39;\n&gt; SEVERE\n&gt;  &gt; happens 8 seconds or so before the first OOME (The bulk of the 8\n&gt; seconds\n&gt; \n&gt; possible. I&#39;m now using a machine that would give me -Xmx2000m with\n&gt; bloom. I am waiting to see if that would get me less bdbje errors.\n&gt;\n\n\nWhat were you running w/ previous?\nThanks Joe,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
