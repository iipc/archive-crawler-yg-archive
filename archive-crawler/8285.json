Could =\r\nyou please tell how can I add a QuotaEnforcer?\nHere&#39;s another question: how=\r\n can I exclude pictures and videos from crawl results? (I apologize if I sh=\r\nould&#39;ve started another thread to ask that.)\nIs there a place I can learn m=\r\nore about Heritrix? Like what I just asked, there&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t know abou=\r\nt setting a crawl up and running the way I want, and I couldn&#39;t get much ou=\r\nt of the wiki.\n\nThank You\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon M=\r\nohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 8/3/13 11:02 PM, Arian wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi Everyon=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m using Heritrix 3.1.1 to crawl the contents of a number of si=\r\ntes.\n&gt; &gt; I want it to get 10 pages from each seed, not including pages from=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; outlinks of the seed. I set the number of documents limit in the\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nonfiguration file to 10, and it passed that. Set it to 20, passed it\n&gt; &gt; ag=\r\nain. If that&#39;s not the right tweak, where should I set the limit\n&gt; &gt; for it=\r\n to work? About leaving out external pages, I have 100+ sites\n&gt; &gt; to crawl,=\r\n so I can&#39;t set regexes matching every single URL (and don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; know if th=\r\nere&#39;s a better way rather than that.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d appreciate any help.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n It&#39;s unclear what you&#39;ve tried. There&#39;s no setting in the standard \n&gt; conf=\r\niguration which would exactly limit the crawl to 10 &quot;pages&quot; &quot;from \n&gt; each s=\r\need&quot; and &quot;not including outlinks of the seed&quot;. (Those descriptions \n&gt; could=\r\n mean a variety of things.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (If the crawl seems to be getting URIs fro=\r\nm more sites than you \n&gt; expected, you should check out the FAQ entry at:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/unexpected+offsite+co=\r\nntent \n&gt; )\n&gt; \n&gt; The &#39;CrawlLimitEnforcer&#39; which you may have seen sets count=\r\n/size/time \n&gt; limits for the entire crawl, not individual sites.\n&gt; \n&gt; The o=\r\nptional QuotaEnforcer processor can be added to the &#39;prefetch&#39; \n&gt; chain, an=\r\nd then can reject URIs after certain configured counts of URIs \n&gt; per hostn=\r\name/server/&#39;group&#39; are reached. (Server =3D hostname+port; \n&gt; &#39;group&#39; is us=\r\nually the same as server unless using some advanced \n&gt; frontier configurati=\r\non.)\n&gt; \n&gt; QuotaEnforcer is probably what you want... is this what you tried=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; (An alternate way to get a similar effect is by adjusting the \n&gt; &#39;qu=\r\neueTotalBudget&#39; frontier setting, which stops crawling URIs from a \n&gt; queue=\r\n -- same as &#39;group&#39; above -- after a certain amount of effort is \n&gt; expende=\r\nd, with the usual policy being roughly one URI equals one unit of \n&gt; effort=\r\n. But, QuotaEnforcer is likely the better approach unless you need \n&gt; to un=\r\nderstand the frontier internals.)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
