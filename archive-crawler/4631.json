Where =\r\nwould be the best\nplace to either extend a current processor/writer or what=\r\never to be\nable to inject my code?  Basically, I am going to be sending a m=\r\nessage\nto another part of my system that will collect the data that was\ncra=\r\nwled and add it to an index.  This process will move the collected\noutput t=\r\no somewhere else for the indexing.  So, I have to know that\nthe job is no l=\r\nonger being run so I won&#39;t leave heritrix in an\ninconsistent state by remov=\r\ning it&#39;s output while it might want to keep\na handle on it.\n\nSo, again, I n=\r\need to know when the job is complete.  Any ideas?  I\nnoticed that the crawl=\r\ner has a callback interface but it&#39;s not that\nconvenient since it just pass=\r\ned strings around.  I suppose I could\nparse these output, but just want to =\r\nknow if there is a better way.\n\nI haven&#39;t looked at the &#39;event model&#39; in 2.=\r\n0 yet. So, I am hoping\nthere is a new CrawlEvent type, or something of the =\r\nsort, that would\nbe passed to any listeners of the crawler.  This type coul=\r\nd then be\nmore easily inspected by either it&#39;s subclasses or perhaps an\nenu=\r\nmeration of event descriptions to find the specific event that\noccurred alo=\r\nng with the job it pertained to.\n\nBut, I digresss...\n\nThanks!\n\nBriggs.\n\n\n\n"}}
