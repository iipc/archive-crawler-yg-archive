However im not sure if it is the right product that im\n&gt;&gt; looking for. I don&#39;t have any experience with web crawlers at all,\n&gt;&gt; and im fairly non-technical. Therefore hoping any of you could help\n&gt;&gt; me. I am wondering if Heritrix supports following features.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Manage user rights and security levels\n&gt;\n&gt; Heritrix supports password authentication for the administrative\n&gt; interface, this is the extent of authorization and authentication\n&gt; support.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Schedule auto-crawl for jobs - for example, crawl a group of\n&gt;&gt; websites at regular intervals in a given day\n&gt;\n&gt; No, but this is fairly trivial to do. You might also look at the Web\n&gt; Curator Tool [1], which does handle crawl scheduling (along with much\n&gt; more).\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Crawl password protected sites\n&gt;\n&gt; The FAQ [2] includes a response to this question. Unfortunately a more\n&gt; detailed response depends on the type of authentication that the site\n&gt; uses.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Indexing and keyword search on crawl results\n&gt;\n&gt; No; see Nutchwax [3] for full-text search of crawls.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is there any possibility that a web crawler could capture the image\n&gt;&gt; of web pages or am I desiring too excessively.\n&gt;\n&gt; Heritrix does capture images, i.e. &lt;img&gt; embeds in web sites. If you\n&gt; are looking for something to generate a raster image from a website\n&gt; there are tools out there to do this.\n&gt;\n&gt; best,\n&gt; Erik Hetzner\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. &lt;http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/&gt;\n&gt; 2. &lt;http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/FAQ&gt;\n&gt; 3. &lt;http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/nutch/&gt;\n&gt; ;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n&gt; ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nEric Pugh | Principal | OpenSource Connections, LLC | 434.466.1467 | http://www.opensourceconnections.com\nFree/Busy: http://tinyurl.com/eric-cal\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
