I let it run for a few mins and then paused it.  Went to\nthe View/Edit Frontier page and added a URI from a file, and was\ninformed 1 URI was added from it.  Then I resumed the crawl.  Couldn&#39;t\nsee anywhere that the new URI was getting crawled, queued, or anything.  \n\nAm I doing this incorrectly, or is the functionality not there yet?\n\nThanks,\nRob Eger\nAptas, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
