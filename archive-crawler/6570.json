When I start Heritrix for the first time a pid file is created. So when I need to restart Heritrix I kill the process with the pid from the heritrix.pid file.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now next time onwards the pid file is not updated. So I just issue a killall -9 java command to stop Heritrix.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I do this and restart Heritrix I have observed that the numbe of pages fetched by Heritrix goes down sometimes.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example: I have a website which has around 270 pages. But on restarting Hertirix by killing it sometimes gives me just 36 pages.\n&gt; The count remains low until I restart Heritrix by killing it a couple of times.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any reason for this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Prashant Katare.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
