In particular, are you dealing with the \nCDX and DAT formats, or just providing an access interface comparable to \nthe ARCReader classes in Heritrix (about my recent troubles with which, \nmore  anon)?\n\nYou mentioned earlier you were looking to integrate MySQL with your \nARC-reader library.  Are you still doing that (and, relatedly, are you \nby any chance using any kind of database abstraction layer (e.g. ODBC) \nin the code)?\n\nRegards,\nAndy Boyko   aboy@...
