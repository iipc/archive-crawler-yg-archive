It&#39;s that if you just get the file,\n&gt;it&#39;s binary junk, not the immediately comprehensible ASCII-based ARC\n&gt;format that had me convinced would be readable 100 years from now\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;One could argue that the same holds for hardware or file system\n&gt;compression, but I would say that in those cases, if you can read the\n&gt;files, you get it out of compressed mode.  Only if a tape/disk was found\n&gt;so long from now that none of the original hardware is available and\n&gt;some kind of other scan is set up would the compression be a problem.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nZlib&#39;s comprehensibility is not an attribute of interest.  Its that zlib \nis an open and pervasive software technique.  If anything is going to be \naround in 100 years, its likely to be.  In other words, I&#39;d argue, \ngzipped ARC files won&#39;t be &#39;binary junk&#39; in 100 years.  If ARCs are to \nbe compressed in a manner thats shareable across repositories, the \ncompression should be based a technique that has the open and pervasive \nattributes of zlib.\n\nShould the way the Archive compresses ARCs be added to the ARC \ndefinition as an addendum (&quot;If file ends in &#39;.gz&#39; or begins with \nGZIP_MAGIC...&quot;) as a description of the common, agreed technique for \nsharing compressed ARCs across repositories?\n\nI see the decision as to whether or not to compress in hardware as a \nlocal policy decision made by a particular archiving institution though \nit&#39;d probably be wise to try and do it with a hardware that had the same \nopen and pervasive attributes as zlib has.\n\n&gt;One way to make compression a little more workable would be to not\n&gt;compress the meatdata lines.  That way, there wouldn&#39;t be any confusion\n&gt;about the length of the block, and it would be possible to understand\n&gt;the structure of the file without using zlib.  It could (and should) be\n&gt;indicated in the header what compression style is used.  \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIts an appealing notion but a radical departure; at least for us at the \nArchive.  It&#39;d break all of our repository accessing tools.  If we went \nthis path, we should go the whole hog and adopt a permutation on the \nswedish archiving format where they use MIME as technology for \ndescribing the record that follows.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;-Lars\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
