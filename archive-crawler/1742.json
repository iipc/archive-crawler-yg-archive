I notice \nthis usually always works correctly.  It seems as though sometimes a \ncrawl will last over the timelimit by an large amount, up to hours.  I \nwas wondering does setting the timelimit cause an abrupt stop or does \nit wait until things that it may be currently downloading to finish.  \nFor example if it hit the timeout but was downloading a large ISO \nwould it try to finish it before ending?
