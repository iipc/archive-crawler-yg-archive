As far as I can tell, it&#39;s caused by continous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; page-seen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lookups, which is log(n), but I might be wrong. Any ideas?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Check out the frontier/thread reports for what it says its doing when\n&gt; &gt; crawl is running slow.  Are all threads occupied?  Are they all stuck\n&gt; &gt; waiting at a particular step processing?  Perhaps you need to up your #\n&gt; &gt; of queues?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The already-seen lookup shouldn&#39;t be noticeable for numbers as small as\n&gt; &gt; 500k: ~3ms an insert when the db is that small (See the bdb section on\n&gt; &gt; this page -- \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?AlreadySeen). \n&gt; &lt;http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?AlreadySeen%29.&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It uses bdb -- a b-tree -- so, yeah, log n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt; I managed to solve the speed decrease, but I am not sure if it&#39;s much \n&gt; slower\n&gt; than you would expect. What would be the expected processing speed of \n&gt; a broad\n&gt; crawl on a decent machine? Do you have benchmarks?\n\nWhat did you change Christian?\n\nWe don&#39;t have any broad crawl benchmarks.  Benchmarking is a little \nawkward considering numbers can vary wildly if any one of myriad factors \ndiffers between crawls (Would probably pay us to set up crawling in a \ncontrolled environment to contrast crawl performance between versions or \nacross major feature additions/changes).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Christian\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Christian Kohlschï¿½tter\n&gt; mailto: ck -at- NewsClub.de\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
