As we plan to crawl several thousands of seeds we =\r\ncannot afford to configure heritrix that it is avoiding traps of special ho=\r\nsts.\n\nWhat could help and would be quite simple is a limit per host, as the=\r\n org.archive.crawler.framework.CrawlLimitEnforcer. I was wondering if it is=\r\n possible to configure heritrix so that the CrawlLimitEnforcer is not appli=\r\ned on the crawl-level but instead on a host/seed level. \n\nAny suggestions?\n=\r\n\nCheers,\nTino\n\n\n"}}
