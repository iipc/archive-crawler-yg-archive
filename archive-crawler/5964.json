What particular problem are you encountering?\n\nNoah\n\n\nG Raul wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I need to gather all the users from different groups on youtube. I don&#39;t \n&gt; need to download anything, i just need a statistic, so i need the urls.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to use heritrix for this. The problem is that i don&#39;t seem \n&gt; to manage to get the settings right because i&#39;m not getting what i want. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; For example:\n&gt; \n&gt;  From this link: http://www.youtube.com/groups_layout?name=emeryscreams \n&gt; i am trying to get all the members that appear on this group.\n&gt; \n&gt; The  users are displayed as a list on pages with this format: \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/groups_members?name=emeryscreams&page=2 and the \n&gt; links that i want to harvest are of this type:  \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/user/xxxxx\n&gt; \n&gt; I need to go over all the pages that contain the users of this group.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been playing with the settings of heritrix for several days but i \n&gt; can&#39;t get them right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you please help me out a little or could you point me in the right \n&gt; direction please?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; Raul\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
