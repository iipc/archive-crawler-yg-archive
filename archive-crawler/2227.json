It took me about 8 hours to cr=\r\nawl\nmy site, which is a small site. Is this normal or have i configured\nthe=\r\n crawler wrongly?\n\nWhat i am confused is that the crawler just seems to cra=\r\nwl on and on,\nas if it were crawling the site again or going out of the sco=\r\npe. Or\nperhaps the crawler was waiting for some downloads or processes.\n\nTh=\r\ne configuration i used were pretty much the default settings, which\nmeans i=\r\n just entered the project site and the email requirements.\nOther than those=\r\n, i left the settings unchanged.\n\nBy the way, i am currently using Heritrix=\r\n 1.2.0.\n\nCan someone please enlighten me? Your attention is kindly apprecia=\r\nted.\nThanks\n\nAdrian\n\n\n\n\n"}}
