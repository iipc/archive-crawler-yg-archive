URIs could appear in this log\n     multiple times, and would also eventually appear in the\n     &#39;crawled&#39; or &#39;uncrawled&#39; logs as well.\n\n(3) Change not-fetched statuses from cryptic negative numbers to\n     text abbrieviations. Here are the proposed new abbrieviations.\n\n     Current New       Explanation\n      0      -         Unattempted\n     -1      E_NoDns   Domain Unresolvable\n     -2      E_NoConn  Connection Failed\n     -3      E_LostCo  Lost Connection\n     -4      E_SoTime  Socket Timeout\n     -5      E_JRtExc  Java RuntimeException\n     -6      E_Prereq  Prerequisite Unavailable\n     -7      E_BadUri  Unfetchable URI\n     -8      E_Retrys  Too Many Retries\n     -3000   E_JError  Java &#39;Error&#39;: Out of Memory or Stack Overflow\n     -50     D_Defer   Deferred (for now)\n     -9998   D_Robots  Disregarded due to Robots Directives\n     -4000   D_Chaff   Disregarded; considered chaff (infinite junk)\n     -4001   D_Links   Disregarded: Too Many Link Hops\n     -4002   D_Embed   Disregarded: Too Many Embed Hops\n     -5000   D_Scope   Disregarded: Out of Scope\n\n(Some of these statuses may no longer be used, or may only appear\nwhn something has gone seriously wrong with normal URI processing.)\n\n(4) Add a flexible &#39;annotation&#39; field way off to the right, so that\n     other notable conditions can be tagged on.\n\n     For example, when we give up because a document takes too long\n     or is too long, it&#39;s still a &quot;200 OK&quot; and a successful fetch,\n     but we must mark that it&#39;s truncated somewhere.\n\n     This will be the last field of the crawled/uncrawled/deferred\n     log, and consiste of a comma-separated list of tokens accumulated\n     from multiple previous Processor instances.\n\n     For example,\n\n       2t,sizeTrunc,noarchive\n\n     ...might indicate that 2 tries were necessary before success, the\n     resource was truncated as exceeding size limits, and a &#39;noarchive&#39;\n     directive was discovered by the HTML extractor.\n\n(5) Reordering & reformatting of line contents. The &quot;second line&quot; of\n     hops-to and &#39;via URI&#39; information will be folded into a single line.\n     Fields will be reordered to place the most important info to the left\n     and adjacent. Field order will be:\n\n[timestamp] [len] [status] [URI] [mime] [thread-no] [fetch-time] [path-to] [via-URI] [annotations]\n\nAny suggestions before this is enacted?\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
