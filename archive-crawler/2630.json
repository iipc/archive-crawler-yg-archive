For example, if I\n&gt; have a separate directory for my state or arc files (say on a\n&gt; different disk) they all get written at the top level of that directory.\n&gt; \n&gt; What if i could specify a path like:\n&gt; \n&gt; /Volumes/Brahman/Crawler/{$JOBNAME}\n&gt; \n&gt; That would allow heritrix to construct job-unique file names from a\n&gt; common profile.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t mind adding support for this, if others think it may be\n&gt; useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this make any sense? I&#39;m fighting the flu so it may not... I&#39;m\n&gt; not exactly coherent right now.\n\nMakes sense Tom.  If you want to send over a patch, that&#39;d be \nappreciated though I&#39;d say doing it right might be a bit of work.  As it \nis currently, the HOSTNAME substitution is done off in \nARCWriterProcessor only \n(http://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/writer/ARCWriterProcessor.html#613). \nIf you put ${HOSTNAME} elsewhere in an order file, its not interpolated.\n\nWould be better if there was a generalized variable substitution for \norder files that lived back in the settings system.  Can you think of \nother variables you&#39;d like to see available as options when filling out \nan order file? JOBNAME, HOSTNAME, and possibly PORT seem most obvious, \nwith perhaps even name used to register heritrix over in JNDI -- a name \nthat will uniquely identify instances -- also?  Would making it so you \ncould do &quot;${order-xml-element-attribute-name}&quot; -- e.g. ${disk-path} -- \nanywhere in an order file element value and have it replaced with that \nelements value be overkill?  Probably.  How about ${KEY} where KEY is a \nsystem property read off the command-line?\n\nMeantime I&#39;ve made an RFE: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1429393&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I looked for a discussion in the User&#39;s Manual for the various\n&gt; *-path settings, but didn&#39;t find them. Surely I&#39;m missing them?\n&gt; \nNo. There doesn&#39;t seem to be discussion of these fields in the user \nmanual.  The user manual avoids this level of detail.  I suppose thought \nis if you need specifics for a particular setting, you can read the \ndescription in the WUI. Should we add description of a base set of order \nfields?  If only the descriptions from the order file?\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;     -tree\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Tom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\n&gt; Software Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n&gt; &quot;You can&#39;t fake quality any more than you can fake a good meal.&quot; (W.S.B.)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; SPONSORED LINKS\n&gt; Computer security \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+security&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=BHmcxBg5sKfN9-gcWnJWDg&gt; \n&gt; \tComputer training \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Computer+training&w1=Computer+security&w2=Computer+training&c=2&s=46&.sig=v0JjJWA4s7mLnWQWdFxuTQ&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
