It works reasonably well except for one major problem - \nwhich is that it runs out of memory eventually (as the number of urls in \nthe queue grows to about 3,000,000, and the number of processed url&#39;s \ngrows to about 500,000).  This is with java getting 1.8GB of memory.\n\nJohn Frank, who originally determined we should use Heritrix, says that \nthis is because there is an in-memory structure of some kind which grows \nas the size of the queue.  He also indicated that this problem had been \nrelayed to the archive-crawler team, for possible resolution, but he \ndidn&#39;t know what the status was.\n\nFurthermore, we really are looking for a solution to this problem, and \nas few other changes as possible.\n\nMy questions:\n0) Was I told the correct story by Mr. Frank?\n1) Was this fixed, and if so, when?\n2) What structures were changed/will be changed to fix the issue?\n3) If the issue has been fixed, what would you recommend doing?  (I.e. \nshould we hold off until a new release is made available)?\n4) In the interim - what strategy did/do people using this version of \nHeritrix use to crawl very large parts of the web, so as to avoid the \nproblem?\n\nThanks,\nKarl Wright\n\n"}}
