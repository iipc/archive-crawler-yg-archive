I have try with\nc=\r\nreate and only the class name, create and the class name and the\ninstance n=\r\name, create with all the string, etc. How is the syntax to\ncreate one?\n\nTal=\r\nking about HCC, I think that I have not been clear in my last\nquestion (I r=\r\nead it again, and it gave rise to a misunderstanding).\nWhat I want to know =\r\nis, if that HCC could be used to control, create\nand destroy instances of H=\r\neritrix that resides in the same JVM, but\nnot in the same JVM as HCC. As an=\r\n example, if I have HCC installed on\nhost A, controlling a default Heritrix=\r\n instance in host B, can HCC be\nused to create another Heritrix instance in=\r\n the host B, but in the\nsame JVM as the default instance?\n\nIf that is true,=\r\n I will give HCC a try, as it could be very useful to\nus, and highly scalab=\r\nle.\n\nThanks very much,\n\ntizo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
