I&#39;m looking \nfor a challenging topic for my diploma thesis. As I&#39;ve been working on \ncrawling/searching in the past (FTP and SMB) I would like to put my \nknowledge in this area to use.\n\nSo I&#39;ve taken a look at the Heritrix crawler and would like to get \ninvolved in this project. Perhaps it&#39;s possible to work on an relatively \nisolated sub-project? The wiki has some TODOs/future directions. I think \nI could be of help in areas where some research and testing is required \n(which approach to choose, etc.). The time frame for my thesis is six \nmonths.\n\nAny suggestions on how I could help?\n\n\nMartin\n-- \nhttp://www.martinien.de/\nICQ: 124394797\n\n"}}
