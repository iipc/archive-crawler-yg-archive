Heritrix satisfies most of the requirements which i need to do. \n&gt; \n&gt; One such requirement would be to validate content which is present on the HTML pages. \n&gt; \n&gt; Can we do that in Heritrix or do we have to write our own processors for it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please let me know. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Rajkumar\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
