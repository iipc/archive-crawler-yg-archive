You can just add your own instances \nof the right types to the configuration (crawler-beans.cxml), and during \nthe &#39;build&#39; stage they will be &#39;auto-wired&#39; into the proper sets of \nevent-listeners.\n\nAnyone extending H3 code and adding their own classes to crawl \nconfigurations should become very familiar with this portion of the \nSpring documentation:\n\nhttp://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/beans.html\n\nFor an existing H3 class that receives notification of each URI&#39;s \ncompletion for its own recordkeeping purposes, see \n&#39;org.archive.crawler.framework.CrawlLimitEnforcer&#39;.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\nOn 10/27/10 8:19 AM, bsdang_2004 wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; We want to capture the events CrawlStateEvent and CrawlURIDispositionEvent and then log the crawledURI info in a database.
