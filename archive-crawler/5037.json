If \nno hit is\nfound the index can be optionally searched again, but this time for an \nequivalent URL\nusing the normalized URL field. If no match is found there either then \nthe URL is\nconsidered to be new. If a hit is found the content digests are \ncompared. If identical,\nfurther processing of the URL is skipped.\n...\nMatching by content digest works in a similar fashion. If there is no \nmatch then the\ndocument is new. If there is a match then the URLs are compared and then the\nnormalized URLs. If a match is found then further processing may be \nskipped.&quot;\n\nThe results I obtained from previous experiments (Fig. 15 and 16 of \nhttp://xldb.fc.ul.pt/daniel/docs/papers/gomes06urlPersistence.pdf) \nsuggest that using &quot;content digest match&quot; is more efficient, because the \nprobability of having an URL match after having a content digest match \nis higher than the opposite (~90% against ~50% for less than 100 days \nbetween sequential crawls). I think this might an useful information for \ntunning the deduplicator and Heritrix.\n\n&quot;It is however interesting to note that any match by content digest \nmeans that the\ndocument has been stored before. While we, currently, insist on an URL \nmatch as\nwell, that is simply because the ARC files do not offer the ability to \nwrite a\n�reference� link stating that a document identical to this other \ndocument at a different\nURL was found when this URL was visited. This facility is planned in the \nrevised\nARC format WARC.&quot;\n\n From this text I concluded that the deduplicator cannot eliminate \nduplicates served by different URLs. For instance, it does not eliminate \nduplicates in mirror sites.\n\nIt looks that this behavior is due to the limitations of the ARC format.\n\nHowever, if we are using the wARC format would there be any problem in \nnot performing the URL match after the content digest match? Can we \ndisable this URL match in the latest version of the deduplicator?\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nBest regards,\n\n-- \n/Daniel Gomes\nFCCN\nAv. do Brasil, n.� 101\n1700-066 Lisboa \nTel.: +351 21 8440190 \nFax: +351 218472167 \nwww.fccn.pt\n \nAviso de Confidencialidade\n \nEsta mensagem � exclusivamente destinada ao seu destinat�rio, podendo conter informa��o CONFIDENCIAL, cuja divulga��o est� expressamente vedada nos termos da lei.
