Does Heritrix produce a DAT file aside fr=\r\nom the ARC file? Is \nthere \n&gt; &gt; an open source tool that can extract the da=\r\nt file from the arc \nfile? We \n&gt; &gt; need the meta data like-contents of the =\r\nDAT file.\n&gt; \n&gt; We don&#39;t have DAT-writing capabilities as part of the Heritr=\r\nix \npackage.\n&gt; There&#39;s a &#39;--store&#39; option mentioned in the Bnf ARC Tools\n&gt; =\r\n(http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?BnfArcTools) that I \nbelieve\n&gt; =\r\ncan create DATs; I&#39;ve inquired with the author for more details.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. =\r\nHow does Heritrix verify that the files that it downloaded are \nnot \n&gt; &gt; co=\r\nrrupted? Does it use md5 checksum?\n&gt; \n&gt; The only guard against corruption d=\r\nuring HTTP download is that \nprovided\n&gt; by the protocols: TCP/IP checksums =\r\n(and, when using HTTPS, its \nintegrity\n&gt; checks).\n&gt; \n&gt; A SHA1 checksum of t=\r\nhe HTTP response originally received is taken \non the\n&gt; fly and stored in t=\r\nhe crawl.log for later reference.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other collection-management systems =\r\n(completely separate from the \ncrawler)\n&gt; monitor the archived disk files (=\r\nmainly ARCs) for decay or other \ncorruption.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
