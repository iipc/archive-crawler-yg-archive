In those\n=\r\nprocessors, and depending of internal states, I would like to have the\nposs=\r\nibility to abort a job in methods such as initialTask and\ninnerProcess. \n\nA=\r\nt this moment, the only way that I could do that, is calling\nrequestCrawlSt=\r\nop from the controller. It worked considerably fine when\nI was testing with=\r\n one processor: the web interface only says\n&quot;Abnormal program termination&quot; =\r\nor something like that, and I could see\nthe errors on an external log, and =\r\nthat was fine for me.\n\nWhen I started to try with two processors, I realize=\r\nd that if I call\nrequestCrawlStop in the initialTasks of one processor, the=\r\n\ninitialTasks of the other is excecuted anyway, and also the two\nfinalTasks=\r\n (I don&#39;t know why, but when I called requestCrawlStop using\nonly one of my=\r\n processors, its finalTasks seemed like it was not\nexcecuted).\n\nAnyway, I r=\r\nead some code of the controller, and obviously the method\nrequestCrawlStop =\r\nis not the ideal to use in initialTasks for this\nporpouse. \n\nSo I have the =\r\nfollowing questions:\n\n- What would the best way to stop a job in the method=\r\n initialTask of a\nprocessor? \n\n- And in the method innerProcess?\n\n- If requ=\r\nestCrawlStop was used, should CrawlController and any other\nclass be change=\r\nd to handle it in a proper manner?\n\nThanks very much,\n\ntizo\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
