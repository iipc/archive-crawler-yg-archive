See:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-935\n\nIf/when that feature arrives, monitoring that log might provide what you \nneed, given that usually there is one queue per host.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/13/10 6:16 AM, progre55 wrote:\n&gt; Hi people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Using H3.\n&gt; How is it possible to find out if a seed I&#39;ve added has been completely crawled?\n&gt; I&#39;m using a single domain crawl, and have seeds as surts.
