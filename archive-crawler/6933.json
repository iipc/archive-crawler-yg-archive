Once the crawl finishes, they can be discarded if you won&#39;t \nbe resuming any checkpoints from the crawl (or, in rare cases, doing \nother deep inspection of the ending crawl state).\n\nThe BDB environment holds all queued-for-collection URIs, persistent \nstate for known Hosts/Servers/Queues, and (unless the BloomUriUniqFilter \nis in use) the record of already-seen URIs. It could only be slimmed \ndown by shrinking one of those structures.\n\nIf there are a number of gigantic queues with unwanted URIs and still \ngrowing -- essentially, crawler traps -- then adding mid-crawl settings \nchanges to stop adding new URIs to those queues, and reject without \ncollection those already scheduled, might offer some reduction in \non-disk size.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/20/10 11:50 PM, Mahmoud Mubarak wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; What about .JDB files?
