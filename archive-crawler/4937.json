This\nwill a=\r\npply to the entire list of seeds.\n\nWhen Heritrix makes requests from server=\r\ns it times how long it takes\nto receive a response, and then waits for that=\r\n period times by a\nmultiplier before requesting from the server again. If t=\r\nhis value is\nbelow the min value, then it will wait the min value.\n\nUnder 1=\r\n.12 you can change this multiplier (default I think was 4), and\nchange the =\r\nmin wait period. I&#39;m sure these properties exist in sheets\nfor 2.0\n\nWhile t=\r\nhis will allow you to speed up how fast Heritrix is crawling\nwebsites. It w=\r\nill change the speed on all domains crawled listed in\nyour seeds. Servers p=\r\nerforming deep database operations, and tasks\nwill take longer to respond. =\r\nA robot that crawls a server quickly is\nthought to be an &quot;unfriendly&quot; robot=\r\n. Administrators tent to be pissed\nat people to hit their servers to hard.\n=\r\n\nServers most often feed pages to visitors who read the content,\nrequest a =\r\nfew more pages, and then leave. Robots tent to perform deep\noperating reque=\r\nsts across the entire domain. Forcing database servers\nto constantly update=\r\n their caches, and perform high order of queries.\n\nSo, while it might take =\r\nyour crawl job hours to complete. Go slowly,\ntake your time, and don&#39;t brak=\r\ne your crawls down into small pieces. \n\nPractice friendly crawling.\n\nP.S. S=\r\norry for the long post. :)\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel=\r\n Clark&quot;\n&lt;daniel.a.clark@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, that does apply in my case.=\r\n  Is there any way to increase\nthe ratio\n&gt; via sheets?
