Hi Gordon, I do agree that it would be usefull to make such an AssignementPolicy configurable - but it seems to me like this isn t an available option.

Of course, for \n&gt; different top-level-d=\r\nomains the number of domain-segments that reflect \n&gt; &quot;same domain&quot; (in a me=\r\naningful shared-ownership sense) varies.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\nHi Gordon,\n\nI=\r\n do agree that it would be usefull to make such an AssignementPolicy\nconfig=\r\nurable - but it seems to me like this isn&#39;t an available option.\nTo offer s=\r\nomething like addElementToDefinition the class would need to\nextend Complex=\r\nType - but currently those AssignementPolicies are based\nupon the abstract =\r\nclass QueueAssignementPolicy.\nAdditionally to this shortcoming I don&#39;t know=\r\n how the webUI\nwould/should handle this case.
