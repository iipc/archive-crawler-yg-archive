(Even people who \nvisit search engines via a regular browser at a high rate of requests \nhave been locked out.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 4/21/11 9:21 PM, wavehorizon wrote:\n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;\n&gt; What are the essential settings in order to crawl/archive the\n&gt; = search result page of yahoo / google\n&gt; = the landing/first page returned by the search results\n&gt;\n&gt; I have tried few settings but doesn&#39;t work at all.
