What fields are you attempting to change to what values, \nvia what URL in the control interface?\n\nIn general there are ways to change configuration settings, either \nbefore a job is launched (or in some cases in the middle of a running job).\n\nBut it would be possible to write a custom component that was hardcoded \nvia its source code. Since you mention MySQL DB credentials, and no \ncomponent using such credentials is part of standard Heritrix, it&#39;s \npossible your custom component has this limitation.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 8/3/12 8:10 AM, dpg.hfwv wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have an extractor that when I open the profile and attempt to edit\n&gt; the the fields inside the console, such as keyword or even mysql db\n&gt; credentials, it doesn&#39;t update anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; I always have to edit the .java directly and recompile and start\n&gt; Heritrix in order for the changes to have any effect.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I use the console to make the changes on the fly?  Is there a\n&gt; file or code missing in my installation?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a programmer that will fix it for me, but before I spend the\n&gt; money, I&#39;d like to know what I am getting into as far as complexity\n&gt; and cash.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
