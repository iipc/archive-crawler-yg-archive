However I&#39;m not seeing any directory been created \nunder the =\r\njobs/ directory. \n\nNormally when I run a recover from web console I was abl=\r\ne to see the \njob directory immediately after I create the job.\n\nIt would b=\r\ne a great feature (at least for me) to add a recovery-job \nbased on a check=\r\npoint directory.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re doing &#39;fast checkpointing&#39; (See section 9.=\r\n4.1 under here \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#chec=\r\nkpoint), \nyou&#39;ll \n&gt; have to do some scripting to assemble the bdbje log fil=\r\nes before \nthe job \n&gt; starts up.  See the manual for whats involved.\n&gt; \n\nNo=\r\n I&#39;m not doing fast checkpointing right now. I can start to see \nthe recove=\r\nr from checkpointing takes some time with 13M+ links. \nWould it make big di=\r\nfferent if I use fast checkpointing?\n\nCheers,\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
