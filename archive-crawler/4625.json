(Alternatively, you could set the mximumum number of threads \nto 1.)\n\n(We&#39;re unsure if the writing of multiple ARC files in parallel on a \nsingle disk, where they still have to contend for the disk head, offers \na real performance benefit; work to profile this question and/or \nsimplify the pool mechanism to minimize the creation of &lt;100MB ARCs \nwould be a welcome contribution.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\njoeyfreund wrote:\n&gt; Hi there\n&gt; \n&gt; I am running a few small crawls -\n&gt; * Each crawl has about 100 seeds from the same host\n&gt; * I am using a crawl-depth limit of 0 (crawl the page and its \n&gt; dependencies, but don&#39;t go any deeper)\n&gt; * I am using a time limit of 1 hour\n&gt; * The size limit of an ARC file is set to be 100MB\n&gt; \n&gt; For some reason each crawl ends up creating about 5 ARC files (about \n&gt; 1MB each) instead of a single ARC file (as I expected, since the crawls \n&gt; are fairly small).\n&gt; \n&gt; Any insights as to why that is happening?\n&gt; Can I force Heritrix to use a single file for each crawl?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Joey\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
