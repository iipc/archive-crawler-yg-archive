Anyone got a hint on the following problem!\n&gt; \n&gt; I was using the the seed http://www.jku.at (domain of my university) to develop and test my focused crawler based on heritrix 2. With this seed crawling worked fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I tried to use other random seed domains (e.g. http://www.archive.org) and suddenly my crawl stalls right at the start?!?\n&gt; \n&gt; If I use the IP adresses instead of the domain names as seeds the crawl stops and does not stall!?\n\nWhat is the difference between &quot;stalls&quot; and &quot;stops&quot; in the preceding two \nsentences?\n\n&gt; I get &quot;Failed to crawl seed, will retry&quot; in the seed report.\n\nIs there any other number in this report?\n\nIs there anything in the &#39;crawl.log&#39;, &#39;heritrix_out.log&#39;, or other logs \n(runtime-errors, local/nonfatal-errors) referring to the seeds which are \nnot crawled, or indicating other errors?\n\nDoes the crawl.log show success for the automatic prerequisites of the \nseed URI (eg: dns:www.archive.org and http://www.archive.org/robots.txt)?\n\n&gt; I tried it with the standard unchanged 2.0.2 distribution and the standard profiles and got the same result?!?\n\nStarting from a standard profile, and simply making the minimal changes \nnecessary to enable a crawl (adding seeds and a custom user-agent), \nshould have no problem at least attempting the seeds.\n\n&gt; Anyone got an explanation for this strange behavior?\n&gt; \n&gt; Im running on windows and from localhost:8080 from my home (which is not part of the jku.at domain)\n\nWhich Windows?\n\nWhile Heritrix works on Windows -- indeed my primary development machine \nis WindowsXP -- our primary target platform is Linux. So it&#39;s possible \nsome things will be flaky in a Windows environment, especially if using \nsomething we haven&#39;t ever tested (like Vista/Win7, running the crawl \nfrom/to Windows network volumes, running at odd installation paths, etc.).\n\nI would expect any such problems to generate noticeable errors in the \nUI, heritrix_out.log, or elsewhere, though.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n&gt; Thanks for any help\n&gt; \n&gt; Georgie\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
