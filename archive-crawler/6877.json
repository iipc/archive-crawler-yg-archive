I ha=\r\nve been attempting to crawl auto forums and gather all posts in the forum. =\r\nFor example I want to capture all posts in all the forums at http://sportsc=\r\narforums.com. I don&#39;t want my crawl to branch out to other URIs but I do wa=\r\nnt it to dive down into the forum itself.\n\nMy problem is that when I try to=\r\n limit the crawl from wandering to other sites I seem to limit the dive dow=\r\nn into the forum itself.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestion on how to configu=\r\nre a crawl so that it will focus on the seed (http://sportscarforums.com) a=\r\nnd all the pages below the seed? So far I have played with the max-hops set=\r\ntings without much luck.\n\nThanks for your patience.  I have been studying t=\r\nhe user manual and reading the posts in this group but still find the confi=\r\nguration settings somewhat confusing. \n\n\n"}}
