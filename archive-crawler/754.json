Even though you&#39;ve started with 20-something sites, if\nmany of them are small, they&#39;ll finish early and then you&#39;ll only\nbe left with a handful of sites with pending resources. If the sites\nare then slow, or you are being very polite, you might only be visiting\na site (or less) per second.\n\nWhen the crawler seems slow, use Reports-&gt;Frontier Report to see how\nmany per-host work queues are active. I would never expect the progress\nto be more than (# active queues)/(minimum delay seconds).\n\n&gt; Maybe I have my politeness settings too polite and it&#39;s slowing me\n&gt; down too much.  What are your recommended settings?\n\nThe defaults are a good start. We go even more polite if we can.\nIf you&#39;re confident the sites are able to handle the traffic you can\nedge down the retry-delay multiple,min-delay and max-delay settings...\nbut patience is a virtue if you don&#39;t want to anger (and sometimes\nget IP-blocked by) crawled sites.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rob.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Because of the crawler&#39;s adjustable politeness settings, with\n&gt; \n&gt; respect to any\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;one given remote server, it will typically spend more time waiting\n&gt; \n&gt; between\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;fetches than it does in fetches/processing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thus even if there are 50 target sites, no more than a few threads\n&gt; \n&gt; may ever\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;be necessary at once, because 90%+ of the target sites are in\n&gt; \n&gt; politeness-\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;waiting at all times.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;- Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;robeger wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got a crawl running with 21 seed URIs, and the max toe threads is\n&gt;&gt;&gt;set to 50.
