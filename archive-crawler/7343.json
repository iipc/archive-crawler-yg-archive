As such I&#39;m wonde=\r\nring if it&#39;s possible (and anyone actually has experience with that) to cra=\r\nwl the pages with javascript enabled?\n\nBy Javascript support I mean : behav=\r\ning like a browser with decent/standard javascript capabilities. As such al=\r\nl the pages that are crawled would be first (before the HTML link extractio=\r\nn) loaded in a Webkit like environment and then once the javascript code is=\r\n loaded and finished running =3D&gt; the DOM is builded. Once this is done the=\r\n HTML extractor kicks in and continues the crawl.\n\nI know that Heritrix 3 h=\r\nas support for extracting URL&#39;s from JS code and I understood how that work=\r\ns. But that doesn&#39;t help to much if an AJAX request has to be done/finished=\r\n for the DOM to be complete. \n\nThanks,\nPaul.\n \n\n\n"}}
