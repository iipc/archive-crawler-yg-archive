One CrawlHost instance may be shared among many CrawlServers,\nso that a single DNS lookup populates them all with IP address info.\n\nServerCache (the renamed HostCache) maintains both caches which\nensure that within one crawler, only one CrawlServer exists for\nany &quot;hostname:port&quot; and only one CrawlHost exists for any &quot;hostname&quot;.\n\nKeep an eye out for any bugs that may have been triggered for\nthis refactoring. \n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
