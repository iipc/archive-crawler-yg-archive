However I have noticed the default DecidingScope behaves \n&gt; differently than DomainScope (which is what I used to use before).  \n&gt; It must be related to how it is converting the seeds to SURT form. \n&gt; \n&gt; For example, say I have this seed list:\n&gt; ---\n&gt; http://www.example.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; If I then submit this with a DecidingScope profile, the subdomains \n&gt; (e.g. subdomain.example.com) are not crawled as well as things such \n&gt; as www2.example.com...\n&gt; \n&gt; But I have noticed if I change the seedlist to this:\n&gt; ---\n&gt; http://example.com\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Then it works and subdomains as well wwwN.example.com get crawled.  \n&gt; However, some sites I am crawling will not be found unless the seed \n&gt; includes the &quot;www&quot; at the start so this is not an ideal solution for \n&gt; me.\n&gt; \n&gt; How can I achieve DomainScope with DecidingScope without having to \n&gt; remove the www in the seeds?\n\nThe DecidingScope with its default set of rules actually behaves most \nlike the SurtPrefixScope of the old scopes.\n\nIf you replaced the SurtPrefixedDecideRule with OnDomainsDecideRule (in \nthe same ordered position), you would have a DecidingScope very similar \nto the old DomainScope.\n\nAlternatively, you could leave the SurtPrefixedDecideRule in place, and \nadd a &#39;+&#39; directive to your seeds list which adds additional acceptable \nSURT prefixes without also adding new seeds. For example, your seed file \ncould read:\n\n############################\n# seed\nhttp://www.example.com\n# directive to accept other SURT prefixes as well\n+example.com\n############################\n\nIt is allowable to use any of these in a &#39;+&#39; directive:\n\n(1) An exact SURT prefix, for example &quot;http://(org,example,&quot;.\n\n(2) A regular URI, which is converted into its &#39;implied SURT prefix&#39;. \nFor example, &quot;http://example.com&quot; implies the same prefix above.\n\n(3) A naked hostname, which is taken to imply an HTTP URL which then \nimplies a SURT prefix. For example, &quot;example.com&quot; above implies the URL \n&quot;http://example.com&quot; which implies the SURT prefix &quot;http://(org,example&quot;.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
