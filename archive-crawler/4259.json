We only require specifyi=\r\nng the user agent & email address in order.xml and specifying the web site =\r\nto crawl in seeds.txt.\r\n\r\nMinalyzer Lite ships with an indexing executable, which can index data fro=\r\nm file system, databases, by crawling web sites or an ARC file (output of H=\r\neritrix Crawler).\r\n\r\nThe search executable takes the keywords and index collection name as inpu=\r\nts and returns the resultset as an XML which can be parsed and displyed by =\r\ncalling programs.\r\n\r\nOur target is primarily to provide &quot;Site Search&quot; for those web sites, whic=\r\nh are hosted on low cost shared servers and do not have JAVA installed (as =\r\nwe are shipping an embedded version of Java and the calling program calls t=\r\nhe search using exec / backtick / system commands).\r\n\r\nThis page explains how site search works - http://www.minalyzer.com/docume=\r\nntation/minalyzerlite--how-site-search-works\r\nThis page explains how the crawler works - http://www.minalyzer.com/docume=\r\nntation/83\r\n\r\nWe have created some live examples to demonstrate the search features.
