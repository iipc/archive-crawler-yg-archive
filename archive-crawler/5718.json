It is almost certain to be a wild\nunderestimate, because as noted, the end of a crawl is dominated by a\nfew large/slow/unresponsive hosts (so previous rates aren&#39;t\nrepresentative), and crawls typically discover yet more URIs than are\ncurrently known.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nTony Wang wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m testing Heritrix 1.4 on my dedicated box and I have set up a job \n&gt; that crawls the following websites:\n&gt; http://www.eBiomethods.com\n&gt; http://www.molecularstation.com\n&gt; \n&gt; On the console panel, the progress bar shows:\n&gt; \n&gt; *Rates*\n&gt; 0 URIs/sec (0.33 avg)\n&gt; 0 KB/sec (10 avg)\n&gt; *Time*\n&gt; 1d9h17s elapsed\n&gt; 13d20h5m27s remaining (estimated)\n&gt; \n&gt; See that I still have almost 14 days remaining to complete the crawl. I \n&gt; wonder if I misconfigured something in the job or it&#39;s normal?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; \n&gt; Tony\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Are you RCholic? www.RCholic.com &lt;http://www.RCholic.com&gt;\n&gt; �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� ��\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
