A total of 21 bugs have \nbeen addressed, including an object-retention issue when running \nmultiple jobs in sequence, a failure to enforce fetch timeouts on \ncertain malformed server responses, and decide-rule overrides \ndisappearing when basing jobs on earlier jobs/profiles. There are also \nseveral enhancements, such as reporting the volume of data evaluated but \nnot transferred/stored when using duplicate-reduction features.\n\nSee the Release Notes for more details:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/releasenotes/1_12_1.html\n\nAnd a list of all tracked changes is available at:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Issues+with+%27Fix+Version%27+1.12.1\n\nYours,\n\nThe Internet Archive Web Team\n\n\n"}}
