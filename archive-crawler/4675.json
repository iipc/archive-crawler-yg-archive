Can the success/failure \nmachines &#39;ping&#39;, &#39;nslookup&#39;, or &#39;dig&#39; (at *nix shell) the seeds&#39; hostnames?\n\nAre there any other errors related to those URIs in the heritrix_out.log \nor local-errors.log?\n\n&gt; My question is everything going OK with the first crawl where I added\n&gt; new seeds to the seed list. Is is supposed to display\n&gt; &#39;Heritrix(-1)-Domain unresolvable&#39; if the &#39;Seed has not been processed\n&gt; yet&#39;.\n\nUnless this is happening repeatedly, it could just be a transient or \nlocal DNS problem at the time of the initial try.\n\n&gt; If this is so is the reason that it still states the above due to the\n&gt; large queue (1106246 queued) that needs to be processed first before\n&gt; addressing the new seed items?\n\nUnlikely. Each host gets its own queue, and DNS entries are placed in \nfront of everything else on that queue. If many other hosts are in \nprogress (monopolizing all the worker threads), the new seeds might not \nbe tried at all for a while -- but also would not show as any error.\n\nLooking at the code, I can&#39;t see a path that could result in both \n&#39;Heritrix(-1)-Domain unresolvable&#39; and &#39;Seed has not been processed yet&#39; \ndisplaying for the same seed, nor can I reproduce by trying to crawl a \nmade-up unregistered domain.\n\nAre both these messages appearing for the same seed? Have you changed \nanything in your crawler, especially with regard to the \nPreconditionEnforcer or FetchDNS processor modules?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
