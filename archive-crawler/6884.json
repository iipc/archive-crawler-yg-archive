I use\n&gt; Heritrix-3.1.1-20100928-SNAPSHOT. I tried to do it manually by logrotate\n&gt; with /etc/logrotate.d/heritrix_crawl:\n&gt;\n&gt; /usr/local/heritrix/jobs/my-job/logs/*.log {\n&gt; rotate 100\n&gt; size=1000M\n&gt; compress\n&gt; create 644 webcrawl webcrawl\n&gt; }\n&gt;\n&gt; but it didn&#39;t work well. Heritrix didn&#39;t write in the new crawl.log file\n&gt; after compressing the first 1G. I didn&#39;t know why, did you?\n&gt;\n&gt; Anyway, I want to rotate the logs from heritrix not by logrotate as it\n&gt; will be very compatible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
