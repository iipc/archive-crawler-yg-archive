It tries different UR=\r\nIs every 5 minutes (exactly 5 minutes, because that&#39;s the interval for fail=\r\n-retry).\n\n - yes, as the error starts, there is no single successful crawl,=\r\n every 5 mins there is this error, and I waited for about 5 hours, and got =\r\nabout 60 errors. But the thread numbers and URI&#39;s are different every time.=\r\n \n\n - yes, there were a couple of more errors in heritrix_out.log after I t=\r\nried to open the UI and see what went wrong. The web-interface would give m=\r\ne errors and after a second or third try open the page I requested. Below a=\r\nre the errors taken from heritrix_out.log, that happened during the &quot;ROS al=\r\nready open&quot; error, while trying to interact with the web interface:\nhttp://=\r\npastebin.com/m28cc94a\n\n - yes, the URLs are fetchable, and I dont think it =\r\nwas a problem with the host. right after I stopped the crawl, I tried to re=\r\n-run it on the same URLs that were not fetched, and they worked fine. Moreo=\r\nver, I have been able to fetch all using H3 yesterday.\n\n - the error occurr=\r\ned twice. Well, not sure about the time interval, but it occurred after fet=\r\nching around 1500 URIs.\n\n - the progress-statistics.log shows zeros only, a=\r\nnd the averages decrease every time:\n\n2009-06-14T04:21:29Z        3115     =\r\n     14         3101          0(0.99)      0(73)             0             =\r\n0        51801         84652            1    \n      10           7\n.\n.\n.\n20=\r\n09-06-14T09:11:09Z        3115          11         3101          0(0.15)   =\r\n   0(11)             3             0        50893         84652            =\r\n1           8           5\n\n - by the way, I havent tried 1.14.3, but I trie=\r\nd to set up 1.15.4, however it wouldn&#39;t run even with the default profile. =\r\nI mean, I have entered the minimal info like operator-url and email, etc. b=\r\nut while crawling a seed, it doesnt even start progressing.

I&#39;m not using any of the link-extractors, as I have =\r\na database of ready-to-fetch rss links. So I have a custom scheduler that r=\r\neads those links from the database (MySQL) and schedules them with the fron=\r\ntier. It is basically a replacement for FrontierScheduler, that does exactl=\r\ny the same job, but also based on the amount of scheduled CrawlURI&#39;s adds m=\r\nore URI&#39;s.\nMoreover, I dont use the ARCWriter, but instead I have a custom =\r\nprocessor called MySQLWriter, which processes the fetched content and write=\r\ns it into a MySQL database.\n\nSo the processor list looks as follows:\nDNS   =\r\n           org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchDNS\nHTTP             org.archiv=\r\ne.modules.fetcher.FetchHTTP\nMySQLWriter      org.progre55.heritrixprocessor=\r\n.MySQLWriter\nUpdater          org.archive.crawler.postprocessor.CrawlStateU=\r\npdater\nMySQLScheduler   org.progre55.heritrixprocessor.MySQLScheduler \n\nHop=\r\ne to hear from you soon.\n\nKing regards,\nIkrom\n\n\n"}}
