A description of how \n&gt; it currently works?\n\nHeritrix currently has no checkpointing facility. However, our conception\nof what we need is heavily influenced by what Mercator provided. In one\nof the papers on Mercator, it is described this way:\n\n# Checkpointing is an important part of any long-running process\n# such as a web crawl. By checkpointing we mean writing a\n# representation of the crawlerï¿½s state to stable storage that, in\n# the event of a failure, is sufficient to allow the crawler to\n# recover its state by reading the checkpoint and to resume crawling\n# from the exact state it was in at the time of the checkpoint. By\n# this definition, in the event of a failure, any work performed\n# after the most recent checkpoint is lost, but none of the work up\n# to the most recent checkpoint. In Mercator, the frequency with\n# which the background thread performs a checkpoint is\n# user-configurable; we typically checkpoint anywhere from 1 to 4\n# times per day.\n\n(http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/najork01highperformance.html)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - Should it be possible to change implementation of modules between\n&gt;&gt;&gt;suspend and resume? For example fixing bugs.  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Definitely.\n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;d need to play w/ class-loaders to implement such a &quot;hot-deploy&quot; \n&gt; feature so they&#39;d check disk on a period or when kicked for new class \n&gt; instances. \n\nNot with resume-from-checkpoint: we can quit the VM, relaunch it\nwith new classes, and then load the checkpoint, avoiding the need\nfor any class-loading trickiness.\n\nTo the extent we use Java serialization to capture the state, we\nwill need to be careful about serialVersionUIDs and class\nevolution.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n"}}
