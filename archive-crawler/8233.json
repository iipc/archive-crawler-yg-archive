The\nsystem runs successfully from Eclipse (in Linux RedHat environ=\r\nment).\n\nWhere would be the best place to integrate a classifier that analyz=\r\nes a webpage&#39;s content (using structural features, etc.)?\nI have written a =\r\nDecideRule class to deal with filtering at the point of examining a URI, bu=\r\nt at some point I would like to\nlook at a page&#39;s content and analyze it bef=\r\nore letting the crawler extract further links to crawl in the future.  Wher=\r\ne would\nbe the best place to modify or rewrite?  Do I need to write a whole=\r\n new Processor?\n\nAlternatively, where is the point that webpage content is =\r\nfetched? For example, is it in the ContentFetcher (and\nits various subclass=\r\nes such as ExtracterHTML, etc.) Where in the\nsystem is the entirety of the =\r\ncontent of the webpage available?\n(to clarify the last question, I&#39;m talkin=\r\ng about the point where the HTML/page\ndata is available for the extractors =\r\nto match the content against regular\nexpressions to find things like PDF&#39;s,=\r\n further URI&#39;s, etc.?)\n\nIs there developer documentation for Heritrix 3.1.x=\r\n? (the doc on the Confluence page deals only with classes relevant to Herit=\r\nrix 1.x, describing old classes like Scope and Filter).\n\nThanks, any help i=\r\ns most greatly appreciated.\n[Note:  I deleted an older version of this post=\r\n, as I have now clarified my question]\n\n\n"}}
