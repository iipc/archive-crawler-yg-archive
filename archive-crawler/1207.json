In some places they are &#39;filter \nout&#39;.  In other places they are &#39;filter in&#39;.  Sometimes their \ninterpretation can be flipped, etc.   This needs to be addressed (A \nwhile back we sent a note to the list on a way to address filters inside \nscope: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/337).\n\nWhat you&#39;re asking to do in the below should be straight-forward and \nobvious, but its not.  It took a few of us a while sitting together \naround a screen to figure how to do what you want. \n\nYou need to use the FilterScope (You choose scopes in the &#39;Module&#39; \npage).  After selecting this scope, add to it a regex filter by browsing \nto the Filter tab.  Once added, return to the settings screen. The \nFilterScope regex shows in a non-obvious position below the &#39;excluding&#39; \npathdepth and pathological filters.  Into the regex, fill a regex \npattern that will allow the desired URLs AND robots and dns.  Using your \nexample below where you want all URLs with a &#39;reg1&#39; substring, you&#39;d \nuse: &quot;^(dns:.*|.*reg1.*|.*robots.txt)$&quot;.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\nozimmels wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; so - heritrix filters are &quot;filter out&quot; filters.\n&gt;\n&gt; what would be the best way to only get links of a certain type.\n&gt;\n&gt; given a site :\n&gt; http://some.domain.com/ as the seed\n&gt;\n&gt; i want to crawl only links that match .*reg1.* and .*reg2.* etc ..\n&gt; what would be the best way to do that ?\n&gt;\n&gt; ( i&#39;ve seen suggestions such as .*(^(reg1)).*\n&gt; is there a better way.\n&gt;\n&gt; AND MOST IMPORTANT :\n&gt; where would be the best place to put this filter and why ?\n&gt;\n&gt; what are the other options:\n&gt; additionalScopeFocus ?\n&gt; Preselector ?\n&gt; Preprocessor ?\n&gt; fetch-processors ?\n&gt; extract-processors ?\n&gt; write-processors ?\n&gt;\n&gt; and why ?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; where is the best way to place this filter.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
