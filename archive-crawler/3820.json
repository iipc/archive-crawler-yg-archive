It handles\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n long URIs, characters that aren&#39;t allowed in file names, and\n&gt; &gt; both case=\r\n-sensitive and case-insensitive file systems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s had limited tes=\r\nting with Heritrix 1.0.4 on a Mac OS X 10.2.8\n&gt; &gt; system running java 1.4.1=\r\n_01.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It does not rewrite HTML, unlike, for example, wget.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Let me know it you&#39;d like it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, sounds very interesting. Igor has =\r\nbuilt a similar tool internally\n&gt; for &quot;unrolling&quot; ARC files to disk.\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nan you explain the rules you use to coerce URIs into\n&gt; acceptable filenames=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is the process completely deterministic -- without consulting\n&gt; what=\r\n&#39;s already in the target directory?\n&gt; \n&gt; The drawback of not patching the H=\r\nTML is that browsing from\n&gt; the local files is unlikely to give satisfactor=\r\ny results --\n&gt; an absolute and many relative URIs will not resolve to captu=\r\nred\n&gt; versions properly.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think it might be possible to make a Javasc=\r\nript-based local-files\n&gt; Wayback Machine -- that loads the local file into =\r\na frame (or IFRAME),\n&gt; patches the inline resource URIs dynamically (like t=\r\nhe public Wayback\n&gt; Machine), and captures any attempts to browse outside t=\r\nhe frame,\n&gt; redirecting it back to the captured local files. If the\n&gt; Javas=\r\ncript and the captured files are both coming from the same local\n&gt; disks, i=\r\nt should be able to do all the necessary steps, without\n&gt; ever changing the=\r\n files themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
