But if we \nwant to have all classes tested, we =\r\nshould provide the necessary \ninfrastructure as soon as possible, in order =\r\nto boost test case creation.\n\nAlso, remember, test cases currently show up =\r\nin the API javadocs, where they \nshouldn&#39;t be. For a novice, this makes get=\r\nting an overview unnecessarily \ncomplicated.\n\nIn my projects, I create diff=\r\nerent source trees from the beginning, even if \nnot every class is tested b=\r\neforehands. For me, having them separated is a \nnecessity. It makes things =\r\nmuch easier, *especially*  reminding me that unit \ntests must be written.\n\n=\r\nSo, from my point of view, a strong +1.\n-- \nChristian Kohlsch=FCtter\nmailto=\r\n: ck -at- NewsClub.de\n\n"}}
