Not as such, although there was an issue with Her=\r\nitrix builds \n&gt; failing on\n&gt; &gt; 2.6 kernels at some point. Myself, I&#39;m runni=\r\nng on Red Hat, but \n&gt; that is\n&gt; &gt; simply because thats what we use here, no=\r\nt because Heritrix runs \n&gt; better on\n&gt; &gt; it. (Michael, I think there should=\r\n be a FAQ entry for this \n&gt; question). Just\n&gt; &gt; make sure you&#39;ve got Java 1=\r\n.4.2 or better installed and you \nshould \n&gt; be fine. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2. Depends =\r\non the hardware. Assuming that there are enough \nactive \n&gt; queues\n&gt; &gt; (mean=\r\ning the KB/sec is not limited by politness rules) the \ncrawler \n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; ca=\r\npable of (in my experiance) going as high 21.1 Mbits/sec (over \na \n&gt; period=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; 24 hours). Peak loads can be higher, especially if you are \n&gt; downl=\r\noading a lot\n&gt; &gt; of larger files. If many crawling text documents, bandwidt=\r\nh \nusage \n&gt; drops,\n&gt; &gt; since each text document is subjected to link extrac=\r\ntion that \n&gt; takes time.\n&gt; &gt; The throughput in terms of documents per secon=\r\nd for the 24 hour \n&gt; period cited\n&gt; &gt; above was approx. 57 docs/sec. (about=\r\n 5 million docs and 214GB of\n&gt; &gt; uncompressed data in 24 hours).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe hardware in question includes dual Xeon processors and 2 \ngigs \n&gt; worth=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; memory (+ abundant disk storage). Heritrix likes processor power \n&gt;=\r\n in my\n&gt; &gt; experience, its performance is usually limited by this factor \n&gt;=\r\n although\n&gt; &gt; additional memory can somewhat improve throughput for high en=\r\nd \n&gt; machines.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3. Yep, read the User Manual. It has a section on =\r\ninstallation \n&gt; and &quot;A quick\n&gt; &gt; guide to running your first crawl job&quot; whi=\r\nch should get you up \nand \n&gt; running\n&gt; &gt; in no time. \n&gt; http://crawler.arch=\r\nive.org/articles/user_manual.html#tutorial\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; - Kris\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----O=\r\nriginal Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; [mailto:=\r\narchive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of \ncallforshadab\n&gt; &gt; Sent: 21. =\r\nokt=F3ber 2005 11:02\n&gt; &gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [=\r\narchive-crawler] can Anybody tell me, Why should i Use\n&gt; &gt; HERITRIX....... =\r\n???\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hi, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am planning to work with Heritrix.
