Now that we need to run multiple instances I need to get JMX working. If you look at the screenshot you will see jmxremote.password has the correct security settings but it still complains about having incorrect security.\n&gt;\n&gt; Screenshot: http://webarchive.linc.tas.gov.au/jmx.png\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
