I think there might be such a =\r\nthing since spiders must use them in order to somehow organize and referenc=\r\ne downloaded data, including data contained by other data such as README te=\r\nxt files and images in tar balls.\n~\n In order to make local mappings more i=\r\n18n-friendly and since FAT32/vfat is used in many mobile devices and pen dr=\r\nives, based on RFC 3629; I would use UTF-8 character encoding tables for al=\r\nl non-ASCII and ASCII characters which aren&#39;t in the 41 char sequence: &quot;abc=\r\ndefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_.~&quot;\n~ \n Say you want to rewrite:\n~\n http=\r\n://www.ted.com/talks/julian_assange_why_the_world_needs_wikileaks.html\n htt=\r\np://download.ted.com/talks/JulianAssange_2010G-480p.mp4?apikey=3DTEDDOWNLOA=\r\nD\n~\n as:\n~\n &lt;local_dir&gt;/com/ted/www/talks/julian_assange_why_the_world_need=\r\ns_wikileaks.html\n &lt;local_dir&gt;/com/ted/download/talks/2010G/JulianAssange-48=\r\n0p.mp4\n~\n and, of course, all URLs in the page must be translated to their =\r\nlocal paths.\n~\n There must be some sort of in page xpath-like addressing, s=\r\npidering/navigation and page scraping as well; say, you only need the Frenc=\r\nh and Arabic translations of that talk. Also, you may need to selectively f=\r\nilter and/or consolidate the content in pages as well, since there are many=\r\n pages that present the same URL with relative &quot;previous&quot;, &quot;next&quot; links\n~\n =\r\nThe in-page, xpath-like content addressing can even be used for an implemen=\r\ntation of a deltas strategy at archive.org \n~\n Say you want to rewrite (jav=\r\na jar/zip files use &quot;!&quot; for addressing compressed/contained resources):\n~\n =\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/files/24053/24053-h.zip/!/24053-h/images/illus-020=\r\nl.jpg\n~\n as:\n~\n &lt;local_dir&gt;/org/gutenberg/www/files/24053/24053-h.zip/%21/2=\r\n4053-h/images/illus-020l.jpg\n~\n~~ \n Say you want to download the main video=\r\n data feed from a youtube page such as:\n~\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\r\n=3Dn5pkDB7zEeo\n~\n as:\n~\n &lt;local_dir&gt;/com/youtube/www/TheOnion/n5pkDB7zEeo.m=\r\np4\n~\n including the youtube user, TheOnion, and the n5pkDB7zEeo part encode=\r\nd\n~\n Say you want to download: \n~\n http://f1.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/OPsgUZByWMC=\r\nDcqm6frjxW1ovKFsKIPhRQGjzpqK16ZETBxWjP4gsRMF68Za5izYlJGnNgDRNOiSBkgcukXfrXa=\r\njN5LKArQr1zA/An%20Anti-Humean%20Principle%20for%20the%20Categories.pdf\n~\n a=\r\ns:\n~\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hegel/files/An%20Anti-Humean%20Principl=\r\ne%20for%20the%20Categories.pdf\n~\n To read an english version of Cervantes&#39; =\r\nDon Quixote:\n~\n http://cervantes.thefreelibrary.com/Don-Quixote/6-1\n~\n they=\r\n want for you to click, click, ... and click &quot;next&quot; (not even &quot;previous&quot;)\n~=\r\n\n ... and many other cases which I am sure escape my mind\n~\n Any ideas/sugg=\r\nestions you would share?\n~\n thanks\n lbrtchx\n\n\n\n"}}
