One gets much bett=\r\ner disk I/O\nhandling when you do it this way.  (Read: it all finishes much =\r\nfaster)\n\n- Be careful with the log files.  They are live and open, and if y=\r\nou\ndo something that looks innocuous, e.g. copy/truncate, the application\nw=\r\nill still be confused by it, since it will have an open file handle\nagainst=\r\n it.  If you are moving things via the web UI, it may take care\nof some of =\r\nthis cleanly for you.  (which the cron work may not do right.)\n\nYou general=\r\nly can&#39;t move a file out that a program isn&#39;t done\nwith.  What will happen =\r\nis:\n\n1. The file name will disappear from the directory structure.\n2. The s=\r\npace will not be reclaimed on the disk.\n3. When it does finally exit, the f=\r\nile name and data content\nof said file will be problematic.  It may re-appe=\r\nar.\nReally depends on what program did what, when, but you could have a \nsp=\r\narse data\nfile, a complete data file from when you first moved it,\n\nSo, loo=\r\nk at why you are moving log files.  If you need to do some sort\nof post pro=\r\ncessing associated with the archive data files you moved,\ntry a copy, with =\r\nmaintaining a pointer in the copy as to what is going\non, rather than actua=\r\nlly moving logs, until the crawl exits.\nThen do a final cleanup.\n\nJohn\n\nGin=\r\na Jones wrote:\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt; Just curious if anyone else has a set up for crawli=\r\nng similar to ours \n&gt; to see if we can get any lessons learned.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have=\r\n heritrix 2.0.2 set up and firewalled on a server that we only \n&gt; use for c=\r\nrawling. We have 3 separate instances of the crawler running \n&gt; and about 2=\r\n TB space available on the server.\n&gt;\n&gt; We have the webui running one instan=\r\nce and we have been running chron \n&gt; jobs on the other two instances.\n&gt;\n&gt; W=\r\ne have to keep moving content from our crawling server to our \n&gt; qr/access =\r\nservers. We don&#39;t have any other options.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem that we have had =\r\nrecently has to do with the chron jobs, \n&gt; more specifically with the alert=\r\ns and crawl log.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there anything that we should be aware of when we a=\r\nre running \n&gt; heritrix and trying to move files out, from the logs dir or t=\r\nhe jobs dir?\n&gt;\n&gt; thanks, Gina\n&gt;\n&gt; Gina Jones, gjon@... &lt;mailto:gjon%40l=\r\noc.gov&gt;\n&gt; Digital Media Project Coordinator\n&gt; Office of Strategic Initiativ=\r\nes\n&gt; Library of Congress\n&gt; http://www.loc.gov/webcapture &lt;http://www.loc.go=\r\nv/webcapture&gt;\n&gt; 1-202-707-6604\n&gt; gjon@... &lt;mailto:gjon%40loc.gov&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
