Admittedly\nmy initial efforts at leaving out images, audio, etc. this way haven&#39;t\nworked, but I hadn&#39;t gotten around to asking about it here.  So, now\nI&#39;m asking.  \n\nThanks,\nRob Eger\nAptas, Inc.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Ahnu Nahki wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Is there a way to only have heritrix downloaded all text/html markup\n&gt; &gt;and disregard altogether images and other binaries.

You might \n&gt; check the archive.\n&gt; \n&gt; In short, not without doing some work.  Lesser work would be a filter \n&gt; that skipped non-text/html content after download.  More work would\nbe a \n&gt; check that interrupted crawls mid-download if the type was other than \n&gt; what you wanted. \n&gt; \n&gt; Though sub-optimal, you could try and write a regex that only excludes \n&gt; resources with URIs that match a particular pattern.\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Yahoo!
