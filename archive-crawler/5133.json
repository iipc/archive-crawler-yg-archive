I have\n&gt; successfully installed and started the server, but I don&#39;t understand\n&gt; where to go from here.\n&gt; \n&gt; You will find my instance of an heritrix server at:\n&gt; http://67.207.136.21:8080/ (password: admin)\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t find any documentation on this (seems like the documentation I\n&gt; have is about something totally different). \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;d like very much to give a try at launching a crawl job and\n&gt; I&#39;d be very grateful for any help you could provide me about this.\n\nYou&#39;re using Heritrix 2.0; the best guide to getting started with it is \nin the wiki here:\n\n  http://webteam.archive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/2.0+Tutorial\n\nThere is more information about Heritrix 1.X in the form of the user \nmanaul; while the launching and UI have changed, most of the information \nis still useful:\n\n  http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/index.html\n\nI would advise against giving out your admin UI password in public, or \neven opening your admin port to all incoming traffic, if you can help \nit. A discussion of the security issues involved is here:\n\n  http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/install.html#security\n\nEssentially, you&#39;ve given everyone on the list the power to change or \nexecute anything on your crawler machine that the account running the \ncrawler java process could do. I think we&#39;re all nice people, but \nwouldn&#39;t take that risk myself.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
