E.g. if we=\r\n crawl an RSS page, we pass some meta-information from the RSS-feed to the =\r\nprocessors for the linked articles.\n\nI am trying to do this with the getDat=\r\na/setData methods on CrawlURI. This is the workflow I am using:\n\nIn the Dis=\r\npositionChain for the originating link I have a processor that adds meta-da=\r\nta to the CrawlURI for all getOutCandidates(). (Just after CandidatesProces=\r\nsor and before DispositionProcessor). I have used addDataPersistentMember t=\r\no make that data persistent.\n\nHowever I see that when the CrawlURI is picke=\r\nd up in the FetchChain, it is actually a new instance of the CrawlURI, and =\r\nthe data is not available anymore. That new CrawlURI instance is than passe=\r\nd to the DispositionChain, but the data I put on it while it was an out-can=\r\ndadate is lost.\n\nIs there some other way I can make this work, or am I miss=\r\ning something?\n\n\n"}}
