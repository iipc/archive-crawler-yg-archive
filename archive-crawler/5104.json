I&#39;ve had a look at it, but must\n&gt; adm=\r\nit I didn&#39;t understand how it works from the documentation. Does it\n&gt; allow=\r\n controlling a cluster of Heritrix instances in such as way that\n&gt; an URL i=\r\ns fetched only once by one computer in the cluster? That seems\n&gt; to be the =\r\nmost important property of clustered crawling. Perhaps you\n&gt; or someone els=\r\ne can fill me in here.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Which crawler is/will be under most activ=\r\ne development?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is the Heritrix mailing list, and so therefore.=\r\n...\n\nNo, I don&#39;t think it was hcc.\n\nI don&#39;t think hcc is under development =\r\nanymore, and I never really\nunderstood what problem hcc was suppose to solv=\r\ne. Arg.. I&#39;m just a\nlittle clueless about all the Heritrix third-party comp=\r\nonents.\n\nI was talking about http://netarchive.dk/suite\n\n&quot;The primary funct=\r\nion of the NetarchiveSuite is to plan, schedule and\nrun web harvests of par=\r\nts of the Internet.&quot;\n\nYou have to understand. Clustering is different from =\r\njob management.\nYou can have a 100 Heritrix running in a cluster, but it&#39;s =\r\npointless\nif you can&#39;t schedule or manage your crawl jobs.\n\nI think the Net=\r\narchiveSuite is amazing work, but I just don&#39;t have the\ntime to look into i=\r\nt further.\n\nI don&#39;t think your find anything like that for that &quot;other&quot; cra=\r\nwler\nyou were talking about. *cough* on this mailing list.\n\n\n"}}
