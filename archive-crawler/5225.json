Previously, you should configure a \ncrawl j=\r\nob to use your standalone application because a crawl job has \nmany paramet=\r\ners and with the parameters you comment is not possible \n(you could to crea=\r\nte a template for all job=B4s). Anyway, you should to \ncheckout, save and c=\r\nommit the sheets before invoke launchJob.\n\nSecond question: the webui herit=\r\nrix interface is generic. If you want \nto see only that parameters you have=\r\n to harcode that page.\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sajib Das=\r\ngupta&quot; \n&lt;sajib44new@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; I was just wondering whether I co=\r\nuld run a simple crawling job (using \n&gt; Heritrix API) from a stand alone so=\r\nftware.
