The Crawl Scope is\n&gt; &gt; DomainScope, but the crawl is not limited to the domain defined \nby\n&gt; &gt; the seed.\n&gt; \n&gt; In default configuration, the crawler will leave the scope to \nfollow \n&gt; redirects or to get embedded items up to a maximum of  \n&gt; &#39;max-trans-hops&#39;.  Change this setting to stop this happening.  \n&gt; Currently, if you set this value to zero, the crawler won&#39;t crawl; \nit \n&gt; stops with a -63 on first fetch.  This is a bug (&#39;[ 1090564 ] \n&gt; max-trans-hops=0 generates -63 in crawl.log&#39;).  Try with a setting \nof &#39;1&#39;.\n\n\nis that to say, embeds and redirects are not limited by the \nrestrictions of DomainScope, HostScope and PathScope, and can only \nbe limited by setting max-trans-hops.\n\nMerry Xmas and Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n"}}
