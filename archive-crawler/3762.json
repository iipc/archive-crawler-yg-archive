A usuful start to such an index is the \n&#39;CDX&#39; output format of the ARCReader; see the ARCReader source and \ncommand-line options for details.\n\nAlls URLs that link to another URL are not retained by the crawler. The \nimmediate predecessor URL by which an URL was discovered -- the &#39;via&#39; -- \nis saved in the crawl.log, but subsequent in-links are simply discarded \nas repeats. Applications that need to rebuild the link graph (like \nlink-sensitive indexing/ranking) typically reparse the content.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
