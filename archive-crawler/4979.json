I downloaded the deduplicator version 0.3.\n\nAccording to the inst=\r\nruction, I should create a Lucene index from my \ncrawl.log file, which I di=\r\nd. However, I only see 3 documents \nindexed. The indexed files are .js file=\r\n and .pdf file. I did not set \nany filter for indexing. I expect to see qui=\r\nte a few html files \nindexed. The step to index is:\n\njava -classpath &quot;f:&#92;he=\r\nritrix-1.12.1&#92;lib&#92;lucene-core-\n2.0.0.jar;f:&#92;heritrix-1.12.1&#92;lib&#92;deduplicato=\r\nr-0.3.0-\n20080129.jar;f:&#92;heritrix-1.12.1&#92;lib&#92;bsh-2.0b4.jar;f:&#92;heritrix-1.12=\r\n.1\n&#92;lib&#92;commons-c\nli-1.0.jar&quot; is.hi.bok.deduplicator.DigestIndexer -o BOTH =\r\n\n&#92;temp&#92;crawl.log  &#92;temp&#92;index1\n\nAre html filtered out from being indexed ?\n=\r\n\nI did recrawl the site again. The 3 files that are indexed are \nmarked dup=\r\nlicated in the crawl.log of the new crawl. And indeed, it \ndid not not get =\r\nwritten to the output.\n\nI looked up the instruction from:\nhttp://webteam.ar=\r\nchive.org/confluence/display/Heritrix/Feature+Notes+\n-+1.12.0\n\nFollowing th=\r\nis instruction did not work.  Perhaps this note is \noutdated. Are the Persi=\r\nstProcessor, PrefetchHistory, \nPersistLoadProcessor still used in conjuncti=\r\non with the code in \ndeduplicator version 0.3 ?\n\nCould someone give me a hi=\r\nnt on how to make deduplication work ? \n\nThank you very much in advance.\n\n\n"}}
