All these sites have a similarity: they contain javascrip=\r\nt code that contains strings looking as fragments of URLs. \n\nSo I suspect t=\r\nhat all these requests are generated because of speculative links.\n\nIs ther=\r\ne a way to tweak how &quot;aggressive&quot; they are? I mean, is there a way to tell =\r\nheritrix: &quot;perform only the speculative hops you are reasonably sure about&quot;=\r\n?\n\nOr, in alternative, is there a way to completely disable speculative hop=\r\ns?\n\nThank you very much\nMatteo\n\n\n"}}
