I am looking for a web crawler which ca=\r\nn get list of links of a webpage and convert a website downloaded in mht fi=\r\nle. It should also embed pdf,word,etc in one mht file.\n\nI am currently usin=\r\ng httrack in order to download a website and convert it into one single mht=\r\n file. It is a good tool but with some limitations :\n\n_I want to get the li=\r\nst of all links of a web page with an API.\n\n_I want to embed pdf,word,etc .=\r\n.. documents into the MHt file. Its not the case with httrack at the moment=\r\n.\n\n_I want to be able to download more websites without restrictions. For e=\r\nxample httrack can&#39;t downloaded form based website such as www.lloyds.com.\n=\r\n\nThanks,\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
