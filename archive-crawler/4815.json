I know that we have some investment in the format, and though\n&gt; we can=\r\n of course move forward it is not clear to me from looking at\n&gt; the sheets.=\r\n\n\nThere were a number of reasons:\n\n1. The XML wasn&#39;t well-defined for most =\r\nmodules, so the benefits of  \nXML were mostly lost. Eg, it would be nice to=\r\n have\n\n&lt;FetchDNS&gt;\n&lt;accept-non-dns-resolves&gt;false&lt;/accept-non-dns-resolves&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;deciderules/&gt;\n&lt;digest-algorithm&gt;SHA1&lt;/digest-algorithm&gt;\n&lt;digest-content&gt;tr=\r\nue&lt;/digest-content&gt;\n&lt;enabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;\n&lt;/FetchDNS&gt;\n\n...so that configu=\r\nration sheets could be validated using standard XML  \ntools. But that would=\r\n also be a huge departure from the existing  \norder.xml, would require more=\r\n infrastructure, and would make it more  \ndifficult to support third-party =\r\nmodules.\n\n2. XML&#39;s nesting provides a good visual sense of structure for th=\r\ne  \nold order.xml and for the new global sheet, but didn&#39;t work so well  \nf=\r\nor override sheets, which typically contain only a few settings.  \nWe&#39;d eit=\r\nher have to nest many levels of empty tags to get to the  \nactual overrides=\r\n, or have two different XML formats for the global  \nsheet and override she=\r\nets.\n\n3. The one-setting-per-line format plays well with command-line tools=\r\n  \nsuch as diff.\n\n4. The one-setting-per-line format closely resembles the =\r\nnew JMX API  \nfor modifying sheets. In particular, code used for JMX transp=\r\nort of  \nsettings is re-used to read/write the sheet files.\n\n\n&gt;&gt; In most ca=\r\nses the values for these new module settings are deduced\n&gt;&gt; automatically b=\r\ny the settings framework, so hopefully you won&#39;t have\n&gt;&gt; to worry about the=\r\nm. They are all listed in the Web UI and module\n&gt;&gt; documentation though.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Does this mean that there are sensible default values?\n\nYes; they default=\r\n to use the primary. See below.\n\n&gt; I=92m a little bit confused, still. I=92=\r\nm looking at the global.sheet for\n&gt; profile-broad_but_shallow. Some of the =\r\nitems hold values:\n&gt; =91root:scope:rules:1:max-hops=3Dint, 2=92, and some d=\r\non=92t:\n&gt; =91root:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers=3Dlist,\n&gt; java.=\r\nlang.String=92. Is this second one an empty string? If so, how are\n&gt; lists =\r\ndefined?\n\nThe second one is not an empty string; it&#39;s saying &quot;Create a new =\r\nlist  \nthat will only contain String values.&quot; To add an elements to the lis=\r\nt  \nyou&#39;d use:\n\nroot:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers:0=3Dstring, =\r\naudio/*;  \nq=3D0.2, audio/basic\nroot:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-head=\r\ners:1=3Dstring, text/*, text/ \nhtml, text/html;level=3D1\n\n\n&gt; Why is the con=\r\nfig.txt file necessary?\n\nIt bootstraps the settings system. Since the setti=\r\nngs system itself  \nuses a BDB, we needed a place to put the configuration =\r\nfor BDB.\n\n&gt; Can one define any settings in it?\n\nNo; the contents of config.=\r\ntxt are predefined. The valid properties  \nare all listed in the file; anyt=\r\nhing not listed is simply ignored.\n\n&gt; What is the difference between =91pri=\r\nmary, org.archive[...]=92 and\n&gt; =91object, org.archive[...]=92?\n\nEach class=\r\n of object can have one &quot;primary&quot; object nominated in the  \nglobal sheet. I=\r\nf  a setting uses the &quot;primary&quot; tag then the object  \ncreated is registered=\r\n as the primary.\n\nPrimary objects are automatically selected as the default=\r\n value for  \nmost module settings. For instance, FetchHTTP has a server-cac=\r\nhe  \nsetting for specifying the ServerCache to use with FetchHTTP. The  \nde=\r\nfault value for that setting is to use the &quot;primary&quot; ServerCache.  \nIn this=\r\n way only one ServerCache instance needs to be specified in  \nthe sheet, an=\r\nd all the modules that need it just find it.\n\n-Paul\n\n\n"}}
