Its as though your runtime is using an old jar.  Try \njavap&#39;ing the runtime jar to see what the CandidateURI looks like (Do \nsomething like: % /usr/local/jdk1.5.0/bin/javap -classpath \n./heritrix-1.3.0.jar org.archive.crawler.datamodel.CandidateURI).  You \nshould see a listing of methods that includes containsKey, etc.\n\nI just tried making a new Postselector stuffing items into the \nCandidateURI#alist.  Basic types (putString, putLong, etc.) work fine -- \nI didn&#39;t have the issues you described above in your email -- but if I \ntry and shove the parent CrawlURI into the CandidateURI#alist using \nputObject, I get serialization exceptions out of BdbFrontier when it \nschedules/queues the resulting CrawlURI.  Being able to add any old \n&#39;Object&#39; to a CandidateURI/CrawlURI is just asking for trouble. \n\nIs this going to be a problem for you?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
