It&#39;s not complete for the \nmodule, but should give you an idea of the style of tests I&#39;m writing. \nAlso I&#39;m adding/updating javadoc as I go.\n\nApply it with\n\t\n\tpatch -p0 &lt; p0.patch\n\nin the ArchiveOpenCrawler directory.\n\nOther changes:\n\n* Some changes in methods to handle null better (trying not to throw an \nNPE if possible)\n\n* Made DiskBasedQueue create the DiskBackedByteQueue in the ctor, so \nthat the FileNotFound is thrown there, instead of on the enqueue() \nmethod (which seemed a bit messy).\n\n* Added default ctor for MemQueue\n\nThere is more work I want to do on the queue classes, and then I&#39;ll look \nat the Fingerprint set classes.\n\nA few comments, basically things I didn&#39;t change, but thought were a bit \nodd.\n\n* JavaLiterals isn&#39;t used anywhere, so I didn&#39;t test it, but I think \nthere is a bug in unescape in the handling of &quot;&#92;&#92;&#92;r&quot; (it gets put into \nthe string as &#39;r&#39;, not &#39;&#92;r&#39;.  Is it live code, and should I write tests \nfor it ?\n\n\n* MemQueue exposes all the methods from LinkedList, since it implements \nit.  Maybe encapsulating an instance would be better, so odd behaviour \ncan&#39;t happen if other code goes behind your back and casts it to a \nLinkedList (I can do these changes if you like).\n\ncheers,\n\njames.\n\r\n--------------040907090003080308070702\r\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n name=&quot;p0.patch&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;p0.patch&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------040907090003080308070702--\r\n\n"}}
