Arguably one does\nnot really need map/reduce for this and could go more with the approach of\nthe hcc project but honestly I am still going through heritrix code so, l\nwould love the input from people on this.\n\nThanks and best regards\n\nMackram Raydan\n\r\n--90e6ba615066b27967049026a0e1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have recently been looking into whether or not we=\r\n can have heritrix run in a distributed manner and had opened a minor issue=\r\n for it.
