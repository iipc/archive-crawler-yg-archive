That is, one or more trans-hops which\nlead *off* the site of main interest may still be retrieved -- in order to\nbe able to render the source page.\n\nBut no matter how many trans-hops, an URL which would have been included\nanyway (ignoring the trans-hops dimension) won&#39;t be excluded. (In Heritrix\n1.4 and prior, too many trans-hops *could* exclude an URL and wanted\non-domain material was occasionally being missed, so the behavior was\nchanged.)\n\nIf you wanted to have very fine-grained control over what hops-paths\nare acceptable, and can use DecidingScope, there&#39;s a DecideRule called\nHopsPathMatchesRegExpDecideRule which can ACCEPT or REJECT URLs based\non whether their hops-path matches a given regex. So for example, if\nyou wanted to REJECT all URLs that have more than 3 X&#39;s at the end of\nthe hops-path, you could configure this rule with a &quot;.*X{3,}$&quot; expression.\n\nMore generally, we most often prune calendar paths by watching crawls\nand adding filters when they are noticed, but would love to assemble a\nstandard set of tunable heuristics into a code module for inclusion in the\ncrawler.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
