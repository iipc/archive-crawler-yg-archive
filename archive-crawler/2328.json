I have\n&gt; &gt; yet to succeed in doing anything beyond shutting it down. I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; re-running a crawl that ran out of memory spectacularly in 1.4 (this\n&gt; &gt; with a 1G Java heap, SURT prefix scope) on a 1.5 snapshot and it has\n&gt; &gt; been able to get a bit further.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks. Perhaps it&#39;s time for us to upgrade to 1.5.\n\nIf you can wait a couple of weeks, 1.6 will be out.  Otherwise, HEAD \n(1.5) is stablilizing (Code freeze in next day or so -- thereafter only \nbug fixes turned up by testing).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; In the meantime, I am trying to do a &quot;recovery&quot; crawl. Last time I tried,\n&gt; the WUI did not give signs of live for a few days, at which point I \n&gt; decided\n&gt; to give up. Does anybody have experiences recovering very large \n&gt; crawls? The\n&gt; user manual states that recovery can take hours, but is it normal to have\n&gt; to wait for days?\n\nYes, its our experience that crawl recover can take days -- especially \nfor big crawls, on slower machines. Yours seems to be a fairly big \ncrawl.  What hardware are you runing the crawl on, and regards your \nOOME, what are your OS and JVM details?\n\nAn addition made post 1.4 release allows you watch the recovery process; \nevery 1million URLs recovered, a message is written to heritrix_out.log.\n\nHeritrix 1.6 will have (experiemental) checkpointing; checkpoints, \ndependent on config., will take minutes.  Recovery, again dependent on \nconfig. can take minutes, but should always faster (and more \ncomprehensive) than recover.log recoveries (For more on new \ncheckpointing feature, see \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#checkpoint).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Marco\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
