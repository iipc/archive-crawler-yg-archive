You could see if running maven from\nthe command-line helps (if you weren&#39;t already doing it). Change to the\nHeritrix main directory and type &quot;mvn install&quot;. Yes, you can also try\nmanually downloading the jars. Say if &quot;log4j 1.2.14&quot; fails to download\nthen you should be able to just download log4j-1.2.14.jar and put it in\n~/.m2/repository/log4j/log4j/1.2.14/.\n\nCheers,\n\nAlex\n\n���� wrote:\n&gt; I download Hritrix-2.0 source code , and imported to Eclipse(installed\n&gt; maven2eclipse plugin).\n&gt; Then building the projects, and downloading the librarys to maven\n&gt; repository.\n&gt; But the library so huge that took much time.\n&gt; Unfortunately��it failed finally in finding some libs.\n&gt; Could I directly download the libs. should I modify the files of\n&gt; pom.xml ?\n&gt; I don&#39;t kown maven. Could you have some suggestion for me?\n&gt; thanks very much!\n\n\n"}}
