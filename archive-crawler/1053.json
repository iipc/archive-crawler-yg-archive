The log \n&gt;files where full of too many files open errors. I had \n&gt;hit about 12000 unique domains ( I was gathering URLS to\n&gt;test a consistent hash algorithm). \n&gt;\n&gt;I seem to be able to reproduce this consistently - is this \n&gt;a know bug or is there a setting I can change to help it?\n&gt;\n&gt;cheers \n&gt;  \n&gt;\nHeyup Mark.\n\nOn the too many open files, checkout the FAQ.
