The log shows first that the DNS\nlookup (dns:kitarapaja.com) fail with a -1 (DNS lookup failed) error after\n30 tries. This would have taken quite some time to happen as there are\nextensive waits between retries. Once the retries had been exhausted then\nthe seed URL itself failed with a -6 (domain prerequisite missing).\n\nHowever, www.kitarapaja.com is found via\nhttp://musalaite.net/liikkeet.lasso?-Token.gr=1 and apperantly the DNS\nlookup for www.kitarapaja.com was successful on the first try. The\nharvesting of www.kitarapaja.com then proceeded from that URL.\n\nIn this case the seed report is accurate. The seed itself was never\ncrawled as the DNS information could not be accessed. However you managed\nto get most of the content because of the cross link from musalaite.net.\n\nNow the question is why do DNS lookups for www.kitarapaja.com work but not\nthose for kitarapaja.com? However that does not appear to be a crawler\nissue.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nKris\n\n\n\n&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n[mailto:archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of Kaisa Kaunonen\n&gt;Sent: 13. j�n� 2006 09:29\n&gt;To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: [archive-crawler] Re: Reports for redirected URLs?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hi again Igor,\n&gt;update since last 24 hours:\n&gt;\n&gt;There is nothing about &#39;kitarapaja.com&#39; in the local errors.\n&gt;\n&gt;The seeds report now says\n&gt;Heritrix(-6)-Domain prerequisite failure\n&gt;Failed to crawl seed http://kitarapaja.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;crawl.log has for http://kitarapaja.com/\n&gt;2006-06-12T16:14:15.203Z -1 - dns:kitarapaja.com P\n&gt;http://kitarapaja.com/ no-type #008 20060612161415201+1 - - 30t\n&gt;2006-06-12T16:14:17.218Z -6 - http://kitarapaja.com/ - -\n&gt;no-type #034 - - - 2t\n&gt;\n&gt;The same crawl.log has for http://www.kitarapaja.com/\n&gt;2006-06-12T09:04:18.305Z 1 58 dns:www.kitarapaja.com LLP\n&gt;http://www.kitarapaja.com/ text/dns #026 20060612090418299+4 - - -\n&gt;2006-06-12T09:04:24.057Z 404 1177\n&gt;http://www.kitarapaja.com/robots.txt LLP http://www.kitarapaja.com/\n&gt;text/html #021 20060612090424030+24 32C3E5QK57XMWJ7LQRGT52JPT7OWUKV4 - -\n&gt;2006-06-12T09:04:36.863Z 200 10184 http://www.kitarapaja.com/\n&gt;LL http://musalaite.net/liikkeet.lasso?-Token.gr=1 text/html #028\n&gt;20060612090431961+639 B2G3XSWJZLDHSNNTPMNVU3PQIEKT3TN7 - 3t\n&gt;2006-06-12T09:04:44.109Z 200 10282\n&gt;http://www.kitarapaja.com/pictures/Gray_Textured51F5.gif LLE\n&gt;http://www.kitarapaja.com/ image/gif #038 20060612090442417+37\n&gt;VM4EHZQIIPEGRR4IJ5INWV4BNSEIA5SH - -\n&gt;\n&gt;etc ... total 931 documents from www.kitarapaja.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Maybe the the &#39;seeds report&#39; could be a little more specific? Saying\n&gt;that a seed was not crawled and no redirect was found, gives the\n&gt;impression that nothing from the site was archived although the right\n&gt;info is in the crawl report.\n&gt;\n&gt;I don&#39;t know how Heritrix found address www.kitarapaja.com\n&gt;because the seeds file has only the version kitarapaja.com\n&gt;\n&gt;I have loads of URLs that were given to me and behave the same way\n&gt;like this example.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best,\n&gt;Kaisa\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Igor Ranitovic &lt;igor@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi Kaisa,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have problems resolving kitarapaja.com address. Do you see\n&gt;evidence of\n&gt;&gt; this in the crawl log or local errors? If this is the case, then\n&gt;&gt; probably www.kitarapaja.com has been discovered via some other path.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you are using Firfox then this is probably not obvious since\n&gt;&gt; browser.fixup.alternate.prefix feature is probably setup to &#39;www.&#39;.\n&gt;This\n&gt;&gt; feature automatically tries alternative host by adding &#39;www.&#39; to the\n&gt;&gt; unresolvable host of the original request.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt;&gt; i.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi there,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have a list of seed URLs which get redirected. I&#39;m not sure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; how I should understand the seeds report which Heritrix (1.8.0)\n&gt;writes.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The report says, for example, that Heritrix failed to crawl seed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://kitarapaja.com/ and it will keep on trying.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But searching log shows that Heritrix has taken plenty of files from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the address http://www.kitarapaja.com/ including the site&#39;s main page.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand there are many redirected seeds which are reported\n&gt;&gt; &gt; correctly like HTTP-302-Redirect-Found http://kihaus.fi/ -&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.kihaus.fi/etusivu2006\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
