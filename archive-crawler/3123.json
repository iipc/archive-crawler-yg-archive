I need a little clarification.\n&gt; The filters I can add to an extract-processor - are those applied\n&gt; _before_ applying the extractors (so i can say to what URIs I want the\n&gt; extractor to apply) or are those applied _after_ extraction (so I can\n&gt; define what I want to have extracted).\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Extractors, added filters are run first to determine whether the \nExtractor should be called.  See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/framework/Processor.html#89.   \nSee how at line #102, filters are run before we call &#39;innerProcess&#39; \n(which in turn calls Extractor#extract).\n\nIf you want to filter URIs extracted, make amendment to your Scope so \nthat only the wanted URIs pass all rules.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
