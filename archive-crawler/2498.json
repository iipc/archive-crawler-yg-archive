However I&#39;m not seeing any directory been created\n&gt; under the jobs/ directory.\nThe recovered job resumes the crawl?\n\nDid you pass order file to JMX addJob or a jar of order + seeds + \noverrides, etc?  If the latter, it will make a new job *based* on the \ncontent of the jar. Then you should see new directory under job dir).  \nIf former, then I believe, it will just use order values as are on \nresumption (Is the resumed crawl running out of the checkpoint directory \nor out of the original job directory?).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Normally when I run a recover from web console I was able to see the\n&gt; job directory immediately after I create the job.\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be a great feature (at least for me) to add a recovery-job\n&gt; based on a checkpoint directory.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re doing &#39;fast checkpointing&#39; (See section 9.4.1 under here\n&gt; &gt; http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#checkpoint), \n&gt; &lt;http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#checkpoint%29,&gt;\n&gt; you&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; have to do some scripting to assemble the bdbje log files before\n&gt; the job\n&gt; &gt; starts up.  See the manual for whats involved.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No I&#39;m not doing fast checkpointing right now. I can start to see\n&gt; the recover from checkpointing takes some time with 13M+ links.\n&gt; Would it make big different if I use fast checkpointing?\n&#39;fast checkpoint&#39; makes the checkpoints -- as opposed to recoveries -- \ncomplete faster, often, orders-of-magnitude times faster.  If &#39;fast \ncheckpointing&#39;, we don&#39;t copy the bdbje logs from state directory to the \ncheckpoint directory during the checkpoint (There can be thousands of \nthe bdbje 10meg files in any sizeable crawl).\n\nBut &#39;fast checkpointing&#39; requires manual or scripting intervention \nrecovering assembling the recovered &#39;state&#39; directory. See 9.4.1 in the \nuser manual: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual.html#checkpoint.\n\nSt.Ack\n&gt;  \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; -joe\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
