Heretrix is often running into an Out of Memory\n&gt;&gt;&gt; error. I dont recall seeing this error with an older version of\n&gt;&gt;&gt; heretrix v1.8 that I had running for quite sometime.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am running it on a 64 bit machine. And the version of java I am\n&gt;&gt;&gt; using is j2se_jdk_sun-1.5.0.07. I have the heap size set to 3Gigs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (-Xmx option.). Does anyone have any ideas on how to resolve this?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Should I try running it with a 64 bit JVM, so I can specify a larger\n&gt;&gt;&gt; heap? \n&gt;&gt; Were you using the exact same JVM (esp. heap) and Heritrix (esp. \n&gt;&gt; Processors and UriUniqFilter) options in 1.8? How long does it take to \n&gt;&gt; OOME?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A problematic issue with our DNS library using an ever-growing\n&gt; amount of \n&gt;&gt; cache memory was resolved between 1.8 and 1.10.2, so I would have \n&gt;&gt; expected fewer OOMEs in long-running crawls, rather than more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some thoughts:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (1) Since you have 8GB, a 64bit JVM and larger heap could help --\n&gt; but it \n&gt;&gt; tends not help as much as you think, because 64bit object pointers mean \n&gt;&gt; it takes a large heap to hold the same number of objects. (One estimate \n&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve seen not specific to Heritrix&#39;s heap: 40% larger heap needed for \n&gt;&gt; same number of 64bit JVM objects.)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (2) Not all OOMEs are really caused by main heap depletion -- some\n&gt; other \n&gt;&gt; resource/memory-space depletions also cause OOMEs. Some of these other \n&gt;&gt; depletions can be *worsened* by growing a heap closer to an addressing \n&gt;&gt; ceiling. If you have a OOME that&#39;s easy to reproduce quickly, you may \n&gt;&gt; want to try running under a 1.6 JVM -- its OOME errors are more \n&gt;&gt; descriptive, and there are other options for examining the heap (see \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/trouble/TSG-VM/html/memleaks.html#gbywi)\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; after the OOME.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Gordon\n&gt; Per your recommendation I have downloaded 1.6 JVM and am running the\n&gt; crawl. 3G is a lot of memory. What could be causing Heretrix to take\n&gt; up more than 3G?\n\nI don&#39;t know; the last OOME problem we had was related to the DNS issue \nfixed before 1.10.2.\n\nWhat is your crawl like -- number of seeds, breadth/scoping, etc. -- and \nhow soon does it OOME (in time and number of URIs visited and scheduled)?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
