First construct the Link object, then use the \nCrawlURI.addOutLink method to add the link.\n\n\n&gt; - What are context and hopType for?\n\nReporting, I believe.  The context should be the URI where the new link \nwas discovered.  The hopType just tells what kind of link it was. \nDuring long crawls, an operator can use this information to trace \ndifficult URIs to their source, for instance.\n\n\n&gt; - Is it correct to add a CandidateURI instead a Link in an extractor\n&gt; (with replaceOutLinks)? If not, why? If yes, should them be created\n&gt; with createCandidateURI, or with its constructors (creating an UURI\n&gt; first)?\n\nHere I&#39;m not sure; perhaps someone else on the list can answer this?\n\n\n&gt; Where can I find such information? Is there a document where is\n&gt; explained how links are added, when are transformed, what is context\n&gt; and hopType, etc?\n\nI&#39;m afraid not.  This list is probably your best bet for now.\n\n\n&gt; I need that information, because I have to write a customized\n&gt; extractor, that will extract POST links from forms, and those\n&gt; generally are to be downloaded with differents parameters. I think\n&gt; that code won&#39;t be of interest to Heritrix, because is not so generic\n&gt; (lot of input data, specific to particulars sites, are needed to\n&gt; perform this tasks), but if you think it could be used, just tell me.\n\nAt any rate, let us know what else you run into during your \nimplementation.  We appreciate any all contributions.\n\nLet us know what else you need,\n\n-Paul\n\n"}}
