I have my startup script written as recommended \nwith the proper classpath in the proper order. Everything seems to be \nin order except I always get the ServerCache error for any domain or \nip address I try to crawl. The box is not running anything else and \nis not firewalled. (I thought for a moment that my firewall was \ngiving Heritrix a hard time but that seems unlikely, I just wanted to \nget that out of the way before asking for help.)\n\nI am counting on Heritrix to feed a knowledge refinery before the \nweekend. Perhaps there is an issue with my crawl order? Could someone \npost or send me a domain scope crawl order that is known to be \nworking? I can fill in the seeds. The order I have uses no pre-fetch-\nprocessors, another post suggested eliminating this part of the chain.\n\nI would like to lend a hand developing, I like the architecture and \nplan to be using it for a few projects but I have to get some crawls \nrunning first.\n\nThank you in advance any help will be greatly appreciated,\n\nBrian M.
