Adding a new \nseed via the Bean Browser only affects the data for a single &#39;built&#39; \njob, and even then, by the time you can change it in the Bean Browser \nthat data has already been consulted.\n\nWhen added to a referenced .seeds file (or inline list in the CXML), the \nnext launch will see it. In a mid-crawl dropped &#39;action&#39; file, it&#39;ll be \nswept into the crawl by the action-process.\n\nYou could mimic the code-path that&#39;s use by the ActionDirectory inside \nthe Scripting Console... but no state-edits in the Bean Browser will add \na seed.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
