And in order.xml i will reference a &quot;seeds id&quot; instead of seeds.txt&#39;s path on seedsfile attribute. So, after a bit researching i decided to change CrawlScope class :\n&gt;\n&gt; Normally CrawlScope class has :\n&gt;\n&gt; ...\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt;      public Iterator&lt;UURI&gt;  seedsIterator(Writer ignoredItemWriter) {\n&gt;          BufferedReader br;\n&gt;          try {\n&gt;              br = new BufferedReader(\n&gt;                  new InputStreamReader(\n&gt;                      new FileInputStream(getSeedfile()),\n&gt;                      &quot;UTF-8&quot;));\n&gt;          } catch (IOException e) {\n&gt;              throw new RuntimeException(e);\n&gt;          }\n&gt;          return new SeedFileIterator(br,ignoredItemWriter);\n&gt;      }\n&gt; ...\n&gt; ...\n&gt;\n&gt; I changed this part of code as reading from database.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that true, how do you think about this solution?\n\nIf it works for you, I see no problems with it.\n\nAgain, though, you might find H3 a better base to work on once you&#39;re \ndoing significant customization. With regard to seeds, H3 more clearly \nisolates seed management in a &#39;SeedModule&#39;, which announces seeds to the \nrest of the crawler via an event mechanism.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
