At this point we can provide these tools to other nonprofit\n&gt; or library like organizations.  We are working on getting these\n&gt; tools publicly available. If that does not work out we are planning\n&gt; on providing open source alternatives.\n\nI have been hit by this lack of tools for maintaining and working with\nARC files, and to that end I have been developing a library in C++\n(which I am more comfortable with than Java) to provide access to the\nelements of a (set of) ARC file(s) so you can extract, index, iterate,\nor whatever.\n\nIndications are that my company will allow me to open source this\nlibrary and associated tools. One of the modules will be an interface\nto MySQL so I can use it for the index.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
