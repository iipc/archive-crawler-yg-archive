Were \nyou doing &#39;fast&#39; checkpointing or letting the crawler manage the bdbje \nlog files for you?  You should verify that when the crawler starts \nrunning, all the bdbje logs are for sure in place (no more, and no \nless).  See the manifest of log files thats kept over in the checkpoint \ndirectory (Did the checkpoint succeed?  Is there a checkpoint valid file \nin the checkpoint directory?).\nSt.Ack\n\ngoblin_cz wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; i have run broad crawl (with deciding scope) and everything was ok.\n&gt; But today we have got problem with electricity and we have to reboot\n&gt; the server. I made checkpoint and after reboot i ran the job based on\n&gt; recovery. It looked ok, showing preparing stage, but after 40 minutes\n&gt; job crashed and poped up this alert:\n&gt;\n&gt; On crawl: CZ2006-decide Unable to setup bdb environment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Exception:\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.exceptions.FatalConfigurationException:\n&gt; last LSN=0xc25/0x2d843c\n&gt; Stacktrace:\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.exceptions.FatalConfigurationException:\n&gt; last LSN=0xc25/0x2d843c\n&gt; at\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.CrawlController.setupBdb(CrawlController.java:498)\n&gt; at\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.CrawlController.initialize(CrawlController.java:385)\n&gt; at\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJob.setupForCrawlStart(CrawlJob.java:828)\n&gt; at\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJobHandler.startNextJobInternal(CrawlJobHandler.java:1135)\n&gt; at\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJobHandler$3.run(CrawlJobHandler.java:1118)\n&gt; at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:595)\n&gt;\n&gt; What this exception means?\n&gt; Is it possible to start this recovery?
