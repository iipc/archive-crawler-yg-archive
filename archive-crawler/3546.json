I was able to try a few smaller crawls and learned \n&gt; how to use the regexp features to crawl what I want.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I wanted to try something with allmusic.com, and nothing happens. The seed report \n&gt; reads &quot;Not Crawled&quot; for all the seed, with either 0 or -1 leading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any insight?\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking at their robots.txt I don&#39;t see anything that would kill it immediately. And I tried \n&gt; setting it to ignore robots.txt anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any response...\n\nWhen I last looked closely at AllMusic.com several years ago, it \nappeared they had a deliberately obfuscated Javascript-based system of \npage-to-page navigation designed to thwart scrapers and crawlers and \nprevent any &#39;deep-linking&#39; to specific pages at stable URLs. I suspect \nthat remains the problem today.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n"}}
