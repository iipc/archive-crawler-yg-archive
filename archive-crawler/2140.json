My experience of RMI under load is that it&#39;s a bit \n&gt; flaky and what&#39;s worse is that its &#39;flaky&#39; as opposed to right out \n&gt; breaking so you find the odd call not happening properly. I did a \n&gt; fair amount of load testing on it and decided that it was \n&gt; rubbish :-). I also load tested RMI over IIOP and couldn&#39;t manage to \n&gt; load it enough to break it at all.\n&gt;\nOk.  Thanks.  I&#39;ve heard this from others also.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve used JMS in JBoss quite a lot too and you might find that it \n&gt; provides a good way of providing resilience as machines come and go. \n&gt; I can&#39;t remember the ins and outs but from what I remember one of the \n&gt; configurations don&#39;t cope well with lots of small messages though.\n&gt;\nOk. Its something to look at for sure.  As long as we implement against \nJMS interfaces, we can also try other providers (I&#39;ve worked with Spread \nin the past).\n\n&gt; For dynamic configuration of the server farm have you considered \n&gt; JINI. \n\nNot seriously.  I&#39;ve followed it over time.  I have a bias that jini \nstill needs work and would be more apt if we were coordinating 100s of \ncrawlers rather the 3-10 we&#39;re currently trying to get going (3-10 will \nbe more than a handful).  But I&#39;ll go look again.  Thanks for the reminder.\n\n(Regards dynamic configuration, we&#39;re hoping that more work in JMX will \nget us this. TBD.)\n\n&gt; Its a really nice technology for this kind of thing - you can \n&gt; add and remove components from a large system in a true &#39;plug and \n&gt; play&#39; fashion. Its a little bit fiddley to get working with &#39;pure&#39; \n&gt; J2EE but you can make it work in JBoss.\n\n\nThanks alot for the feedback Mark.\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; cheers\n&gt;\n&gt; mark\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 17 Aug 2005, at 20:26, stack wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve added some notes on multimachine crawling to the wiki, here:\n&gt; &gt; http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?\n&gt; &gt; MultimachineCrawl#practical.\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;d be great to hear people&#39;s feedback on how they think a &#39;hive of\n&gt; &gt; heritrices&#39; might coordinate to achieve a large-scale crawl.\n&gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
