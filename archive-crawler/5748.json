I can browse =\r\nthem using a proxy. The proxy can resolve their domain names with its own l=\r\nocal dns server, but I couldn&#39;t by myself. So it&#39;s possible to browse them =\r\nwith a proxy-configured browser, even if my host couldn&#39;t resolve their dom=\r\nainnames.\n\nI used the http-proxy option in heritrix, but it fails. The fron=\r\ntier logs show me that Heritrix is trying to dns-resolve the domains. I tri=\r\ned to remove the FetchDNS fetcher, but then heritrix complains about a wron=\r\ng profile and I couldn&#39;t create a job.\n\nFinally, I&#39;ve got this configuratio=\r\nn :\na fetcher.FetchDNS with a AcceptDecideRule in it,\nand I have accept-non=\r\n-dns-resolves set to true\n\nHeritrix continues to hang on DNS request (reque=\r\nsts in snooze and long queues), unless I put the domainnames in /etc/hosts.=\r\n Then it will correctly crawl the domains in /etc/hosts, and ignore the oth=\r\ners.\n\nIs there a way to tell heritrix to not use the DNS/resolver at all ?\n=\r\n\nRegards,\nSylvain\n\n\n"}}
