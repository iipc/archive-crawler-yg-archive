I have found that when I create a new profile through the web UI, the order.xml file created is empty.  This carries over to jobs created using that profile: they have an empty order.xml file too. Obviously, these jobs don&#39;t work. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have also tried Heritrix 1.12.1 and I see the same behaviour, so presumably the problem is at my end. I have listed the Alerts I get below. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Here are a few more details:\n&gt; \n&gt; When I create the profile in the web UI, I edit it and change the User-Agent and From header fields.  If I go back and edit it again in the web UI, my changes are still there, even though the order.xml file in the profile directory is zero bytes. If I stop Heritrix and restart, my changes are gone in the web UI too (suggests these values are cached?). \n&gt; \n&gt; If I add seeds to the profile, the seeds.xml file is saved correctly in the profile directory (and used in any job) alongside the empty order.xml file.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Looking back in the mailing list, I see Sonja Schaule reported the same problem on 12/12/07 but got no response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also looking back on the mailing list I think someone else (Eric Hetzner?) stating that the Java packaged with Ubuntu/Debian was &quot;not worth bothering with&quot;. Could this be the problem?  And why--a crazy Debian security measure?\n&gt; \n&gt; TIA.\n&gt; Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When creating the profile I get alerts like this:\n&gt; \n&gt; Time:   \t Mar. 28, 2008 02:20:04 GMT\n&gt; Level:  \tWARNING\n&gt; Message:  \t\n&gt; no root element: U+ffffffff in &#39;file:///home/paynter/Heritrix/heritrix-1.12.1/conf/profiles/single-site/order.xml&#39;, line: 1, column: 1\n&gt; Exception:  \t\n&gt; No associated exception.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I create a job based on the profile it also has an empty order.xml file, so I get alerts like these:\n&gt; \n&gt; Time:   \t Mar. 28, 2008 02:34:29 GMT\n&gt; Level:  \tWARNING\n&gt; Message:  \t\n&gt; no root element: U+ffffffff in &#39;file:///home/paynter/Heritrix/heritrix-1.12.1/jobs/doomed-to-failure-20080328023407300/order.xml&#39;, line: 1, column: 1\n&gt; Exception:  \t\n&gt; No associated exception.\n&gt; \n&gt; Time:   \t Mar. 28, 2008 02:34:29 GMT\n&gt; Level:  \tSEVERE\n&gt; Message:  \t\n&gt; On crawl: doomed-to-failure You must set the User-Agent and From HTTP header values to acceptable strings. \n&gt;  User-Agent: [software-name](+[info-url])[misc]\n&gt;  From: [email-address]\n&gt; Exception:  \t\n&gt; org.archive.crawler.framework.exceptions.FatalConfigurationException: unacceptable user-agent  or from (Reedit your order file).\n&gt; Stacktrace: org.archive.crawler.framework.exceptions.FatalConfigurationException: unacceptable user-agent  or from (Reedit your order file).\n&gt;    at org.archive.crawler.datamodel.CrawlOrder.checkUserAgentAndFrom(CrawlOrder.java:436)\n&gt;    at org.archive.crawler.framework.CrawlController.initialize(CrawlController.java:335)\n&gt;    at org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJob.setupForCrawlStart(CrawlJob.java:846)\n&gt;    at org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJobHandler.startNextJobInternal(CrawlJobHandler.java:1142)\n&gt;    at org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJobHandler.startNextJobInternal(CrawlJobHandler.java:1152)\n&gt;    at org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJobHandler$3.run(CrawlJobHandler.java:1125)\n&gt;    at java.lang.Thread.run(libgcj.so.81)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please consider our environment...  do you really need to print this email?\n&gt; \n&gt; This communication, including any attachments, is confidential.
