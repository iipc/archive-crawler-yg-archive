I&#39;m still working with heritrix-1.14.1.  I&#39;m already ALMOST up to =\r\nbeginner status!  At this time, I&#39;m having problems when a crawl job hits i=\r\nts max-document-download limit.  Given a reasonably hefty download limit, h=\r\neritrix generates several arc.gz files - but the process usually leaves one=\r\n final arc.gz.open file.  For me, this has prevented recovery of the last .=\r\narc file for processing by bin/arcreader, which demands its input in a .arc=\r\n file.  Does anybody know if its possible to persuade heritrix to close a s=\r\ntill-open archive file on exit?  Does anybody know how?\n\nAny suggestions wo=\r\nuld be welcome.\n\n-Rich B.\n\n\n"}}
