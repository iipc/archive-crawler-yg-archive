(GCJ, in particular, seems to work just enough for \nheritrix to make you think it&#39;s OK, before failing in important ways.)\n\nIf basic operations are failing but no errors are evident in the web UI, \nthere should be clues appearing in the heritrix_out.log -- either at \nstartup or when operations fail.\n\n(That Ubuntu has for recent releases defaulted to the the lightweight \n&#39;dash&#39; shell over &#39;bash&#39; can cause problems for shell scripts, but I \ndon&#39;t think that&#39;s the case here -- we only use a shell script to \ninitiall launch, which is working for you.)\n\n- Gordon@ IA\n\nbowser.richard wrote:\n&gt; I have been runing the 1.14.3 web crawler under Ubuntu 8.10 for several months.  I just moved on to Ubuntu 9.04, only to find Heritrix&#39;s control interface broken here.  The first thing I noticed was that while I can still start Heritrix and get into the WUI console to create jobs, major parts of console functionality are lost. For example, if I try to Shut down Heritrix software I get as far as the &quot;Are you sure?&quot; screen, I can go no further. Whenever I click on &quot;I&#39;m sure, shut it down&quot; - nothing happens.  However, clicking on &quot;Cancel&quot; does cause the request to vanish.  Yet the only way I can shut down Heritrix is by rebooting my system (I haven&#39;t tried killing the process. The shutdown script is DOA.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Trying to start a job also fails.  I can create a job.  The modules button should take me to the configuration page.  But no, it just returns me to the Jobs page which shows the pending job I&#39;m trying to create.  However, I can click on the &quot;Edit configuration&quot; option, which gets me to the configuration page.  Only problem is then there&#39;s no way to get to the &quot;Submit job&quot; button.  I have to use my browser&#39;s back button to get to the console window with that tab.  But if I click it Heritrix looses all my configuration options.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s obvious that something is upsetting normal script functionality here.  Can somebody help me idenitfy this problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; Rich B.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
