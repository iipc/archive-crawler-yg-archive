We&#39;d \nlike to make our tools more robust; can you say anything more about the \ndamage, and what versions of the indexing tools you&#39;re using, and how \nexactly they fail? (Is the entire ARC left out, or just the portion \nafter the corruption?)\n\nThat said, holding tools constant, the most straightforward strategy if \nyou believe the corruption to be of a limited range of the file is \nprobably to:\n\n(1) Identify the last uncorrupted record. Create one new ARC that is \nonly through that record.\n\n(2) From the end of the last good record, search through the file for \nthe distinctive byte pattern that accompanies the beginning of a GZIP \nmember -- hex 0x1F8B -- and each place it appears, try treating the \nremainder of the file for successful indexing with your tools. (Each \nARC/WARC record begins a new independent GZIP member.)\n\n(3) For the first such point that succeeds, create a second new ARC that \nis the original ARC from that point forward.\n\nIt&#39;s not a guarantee that all 0x1F8B occurences start GZIP ranges, but \nthat pattern gives a limited number of candidate points to try for \ninterpreting the tail of the file.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\neleonora_nicchiarelli wrote:\n&gt; Dear all, \n&gt; \n&gt; We are archiving arc.gz files created by Heritrix through the Netarchive Suite. We have strong reasons to believe that one of our files has been corrupted on the disk (its size is only ~19 MB, and it is not possible to unzip it conventionally). \n&gt; \n&gt; Now we would like to &quot;extend&quot; the file to a valid arc.gz file so that it is possible to view its contents through e.g. wayback all the same (which is not possible at the moment). Is there a standard way to do this? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks in advance, \n&gt; \n&gt; Eleonora\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
