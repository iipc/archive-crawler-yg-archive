(Sorry I have an interest \n&gt;in\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this, and do not want to cause issues with the Heritrix group).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt;It would be great if Heritrix ran on Windows.� We just don&#39;t have the\n&gt;\n&gt;resources nor motivation ourselves to make it happen.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am more than willing to sustain, support, and otherwise care and feed \n&gt;as a\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; CVS for a windows version if I could get people to help out in the \n&gt;coding\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; process.(I have bandwidth, IP addresses, and can host if needed/wanted, \n&gt;and\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the interest to do so).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I know this is out of scope for the normal Heritrix group, but would \n&gt;the\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; group be interested in a windows off shoot?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt;Do you think that the changes needed to make Heritrix run on windows are\n&gt;\n&gt;such that we&#39;d need a whole separate project?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;How about submitting patches that we&#39;d review to ensure &quot;...didn&#39;t cause\n&gt;\n&gt;any instability...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks Dan,\n&gt;\n&gt;St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; R/Dan\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: stack [mailto:stack@...]\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 21, 2006 10:12 AM\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cc: rmorrill@...\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] Heritrix - Windows - DNS Java\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; DAN MORRILL wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi folks,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I know that the Heritrix crawler is not supported on windows, but \n&gt;thought\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;����\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would share the last 2 weeks of experimentation of heritrix on windows \n&gt;and\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;����\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the conclusions that I have drawn. This is for information only, and if\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; someone has the time to work on the one issue that I found, that would \n&gt;be\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; great.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;����\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the below Dan.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wonder if upgrading our dnsjava from 1.6.2 to current release of 2.0.1\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; would improve the story on windows (I just had a quick look.� The 2.0.1\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; version seems to have changed its API so would take a little work\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; getting on to the new version of the library).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I was able to finish the experimentation of Heritrix on windows and \n&gt;found\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; out that it has to do with the DNS Java components. I tried on windows \n&gt;XP,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;����\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; windows 2003 server enterprise edition set up as IIS and DNS servers on\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;����\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;��\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; network.

No worries there, it is going to be an \n&gt;interesting\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time if I decide to stay with Linux.
