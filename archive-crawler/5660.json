Here are two old threads with \nmore info:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/4142\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/4578\n\nA similar procedure but with a &#39;[classname].subclasses&#39; file applies in \n2.0.x and is mentioned here:\n\nhttp://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/5268\n\n(Also in 2.0, you can type the fully-qualified name of any class on the \nclasspath to add it in the web UI.)\n\nThe approach may change slightly again in 2.2 and beyond, but we will \ndefinitely maintain the ability to type the full name of any desired \nclass to include it in the configuration.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\nScott Ganyo wrote:\n&gt; Hey guys!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m new at the Heritrix game (and to this forum), so I apologize in advance if I&#39;ve missed \n&gt; something in the documentation or in prior discussions, but I can&#39;t figure out how to write \n&gt; and install a custom DecideRule in Heritrix.  Can somebody point me to some information on \n&gt; this?
