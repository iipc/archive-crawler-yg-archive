The fetching stage MAY put these together\n   in a single HTTP/1.1 connection. However, the fetching\n   stage should only emit unchained CrawlURIs\n - the fetching stage may have separate &quot;nextSink&quot;s\n   for (1) passing along definitively tried CrawlURIs (eg: \n   got a response, or a serious error), or (2) \n   transient failures, which MAY be fed back (to \n   the fetching stage, or a preprocessing stage) for\n   more immediate retries.\n\n - Post-meeting refinement: I believe the Fetching\n   stage should be able to add a (configured) user-agent,\n   if one does not already exist. \n\nWill further work out and document contracts of minimal \n(framework) stages/roles, as Java/Javadoc skeletons where\nappropriate. \n\nOTHER KEY ISSUES TO VISIT SOON:\n - checkpointing & crawler pause/restart/stop issues\n - persistence and multi-machine distribution of URI frontier\n\n--\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
