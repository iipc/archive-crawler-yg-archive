First of all i use heritrix\nversion 1.3.0-200412111608. I wrote a lil processor\nand wanted to test if it can get accessed via\nheritrix&#39;s web-console... i have the class in\nclasspath (i know that it works cuz i had exactly the\nsame classpath-entry with the 1.2.0 release of\nheritrix and it worked there) i put the\nfully-qualified classname into the\nprocessors.options-file in conf&#92;modules (same goes\nhere i tested it with 1.2.0 and it works without\nproblems there)... Somehow i get the feeling there was\nsomething changed with the modules-loading procedure\nbut i looked into the docs that came with the\n1.3.0-200412111608 version but i didn&#39;T find a hint\nwhat i did wrong... Can anybody explain me what i did wrong??\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nTake Yahoo! Mail with you!
