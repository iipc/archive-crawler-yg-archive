Does\n&gt; &gt; this help?\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I&#39;ve already managed to login successfully on several hosts\n&gt; using HTML form credentials, but lately I&#39;ve been getting some\n&gt; InvalidAttributeValueException like if my inputs were all left blank.\nIs there a reproducible sequence of events that lead to your getting \nbelow exception?  Is it with HEAD of heritrix or a released version?  \nSounds like a bug with our persisting fields out of the UI (Someone \nrecently reported to the sourceforge Bugs list a simliar issue where we \ndon&#39;t persist if UI is not in expert mode?).\n\n...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; About that other issue (rerunning the login). Some inputs are\n&gt; generated by the server based on my IP and God knows what...thats why\n&gt; I wanted to retry the post. Apparently thats not possible right?\n&gt; (6.2.3.2.4. Known Limitations\nIs it that the form inputs differ by &#39;god knows what&#39; every time you \nrun?  Thats annoying.  So, how do you handle it?  You notice \nfailure-to-login in log, then change form inputs in UI?  And then, after \nchanging the form inputs, you want to retry the page -- but the page \ndoes not get retried because the page has already been crawled? \n\nHave you tried force fetching the URL? (Force fetching is available in a \npaused crawler. See toward bottom of the screen, the &#39;View or Edit \nFrontier URIs &lt;http://localhost:8080/console/frontier.jsp&gt;&#39; link). Force \nfetching may work.  But it might not because we keep the credential \nstate in the server object.  The old state may block the rerunning of \nthe credentials.  I haven&#39;t tried it (Otherwise, need to add to UI and \nJMX a way to clear any stored server credentials).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
