The \ncrawler is configured wit=\r\nh CrawlMapping (in preparation for multi-\nmachine crawl) setup with HostQue=\r\nuePolicy.\n\nI know I&#39;m supposed to use Bloom filter for bigger crawls but ca=\r\nn \nanyone explain to me that I should give bloom filter another try \nrather=\r\n than stick with BdbUniqFilter? Assuming that my goal is to \nprove the 1500=\r\nMB heap configuration can download more 30M links?\n\nI&#39;m running 1.5.0_05 32=\r\nbit JVM on 1.6.0 heritrix.\n\ncheers,\n\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n"}}
