The links that are in =\r\nthe scope are &quot;promoted&quot; to \n&gt; CandidateURIs (if not CandidateURIs already)=\r\n and later scheduled to be \n&gt; crawled.\n&gt; \n&gt; The decide rules of the LinkSco=\r\nper itself simply decide if the\n&gt; LinkScoper will be skipped the next proce=\r\nssor in the processor chain\nor not.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the LinkScoper is skipped, I be=\r\nlieve that getting ClassCastException \n&gt; errors is to be expected.  The ext=\r\nractors create Link and not \n&gt; CandidateURI links needed by Scheduler. Howe=\r\nver, if you use your own \n&gt; extractors that create CAndidateURI links, skip=\r\nping the LinkScoper \n&gt; simple means that all extracted links will be schedu=\r\nled.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to reject already schedule links, that can be done wi=\r\nth \n&gt; Preselector&#39;s options like recheck-scope, block-all and etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; I h=\r\nope this helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Take care,\n&gt; i.\n\n\n"}}
