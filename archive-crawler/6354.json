As the configuration is now done through a spring application context, a PropertyOverrideConfigurer can be used to override almost everything. So is there is a reason for the keyedProperties?\n&gt; \n&gt; I may be missing something.\n\nKeyedProperties implements what we now call &#39;overlays&#39; (to avoid \nconfusion with Spring&#39;s various &#39;overrides&#39;).\n\nIt allows the value of a setting to vary based on the context -- usually \n  triggered off the URI-in-progress and current thread -- in which it is \nchecked.\n\nFor example, it allows the frontier &#39;minDelayMs&#39; to be the default for \nmost URIs, but then for some subset of URIs, usually defined by a SURT \nprefix, assume some other value.\n\nThese alternate overlay values are collected in &#39;Sheet&#39; beans, and \nassociated with certain SURT-prefixes or other rulesets via \n&#39;SheetAssociation&#39; beans. (You would only need to consider \nKeyedProperties yourself if implementing your own components that want \nto offer &#39;overlayable&#39; settings.)\n\nSee this part of the H3 User Guide for more details:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Sheets\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Bertrand\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
