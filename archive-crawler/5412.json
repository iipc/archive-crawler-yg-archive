For\n&gt; example, I&#39;ve seen it used analogously to a client-side query-string:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://example.com/app#redirectTo=/help\n&gt;\n&gt; Javascript in such a page might load different URIs, construct different\n&gt; outlinks, or do an immediate redirect to a different URI depending on\n&gt; the &#39;#fragment&#39;. Theoretically (but not yet), Heritrix could find those\n&gt; links if it preserved the &#39;#fragment&#39;. (It also might need to\n&gt; re-extract, though not necessarily re-fetch, that same URI when it is\n&gt; encountered with a different &#39;#fragment&#39; later.)\n&gt;\n\nExactly. That&#39;s what I was talking about. Actually, I am even building\na 100% Ajax site myself right now that heavily relies on the hash to\nstore data. Without it, navigation is impossible :) (of course, you\nneed JS to use the site).\n\nIf you don&#39;t want to store the #fragment in the URI part in the WARC,\nwhere would/could that go?\n\nJean-Noel\n\n"}}
