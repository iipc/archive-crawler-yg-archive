The architecture seems well planned and usable.  \nHowever some of the coding style used makes it hard to develop for.  The \nuse of AList may make sense from an under the hood perspective, but it \ncertainly makes the API hard to use for a developer interested in \nextending is feature set.  Rather than calling CrawlURL.getStatusCode() \nI have to know that the AList has a entry for the HttpMethod (containing \nthe response) and figure out which String constant is the key.  I think \nif the interface into the code was more usable to green (wrt Heretrix) \ndevelopers, I would catch on much faster.  Not a flame just a suggestion \n(trying to help with this promising project).\n\nRich Collins\nDirector of Information Technology\nInjuryBoard.com\n813-225-1313 x228\nrcollins@...\n\n\n\nstackarchiveorg wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dave Skinner wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) should these variables be defined in crawlURI or be part of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alist or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even somewhere else?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; CrawlURI is the right place.
