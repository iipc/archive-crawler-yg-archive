FetchHTTP will interpret the PASS result to  \nmean the same as ACCEPT.\n\nYou&#39;ll want to do two things.\n\nFirst, since the MatchesRegExpDecideRule won&#39;t be affected by HTTP  \nheaders, you want to move it to HTTP:decide-rules instead of  \nHTTP:midfetch-rules.\n\nNext, you want to prepend a RejectDecideRule to the front of both  \nHTTP:decide-rules and HTTP:midfetch-rules. That will cause URIs to be  \nrejected by default. Only those that match the regexp in  \nMatchesRegExpDecideRule will have their headers fetched, on only  \nthose whose content-type header matches  \nContentTypeMatchesRegExpDecideRule will have their content fetched.\n\n&gt; 3.
