But, we are \nmaking another round of significant changes for 2.2. So rather than \nadjust twice, we intend to skip straight from 1.14.x to 2.2.x. And, \nunless people specifically need features only in 2.0.x, we&#39;d recommend \nthe same for others.\n\n&gt; OK, related to the information above, we run several new benchmark \n&gt; crawls with a seed set of around 1M URIs.\n&gt; In all the different test runs we had no problems.\n&gt; We fetched ~10M page/day and the whole system did not show a unormalities.\n&gt; So, we think that the seed report generation, Gordon mentioned, is the \n&gt; problem for the crashing of heritrix in the previous test runs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for the help!\n\nGlad to hear you&#39;ve had more success, and you&#39;re welcome!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
