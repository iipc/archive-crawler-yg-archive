If this key is dependent on all \n&gt; request headers\n&gt; it will only work for specific browsers, referrer combinations.\n&gt; I guess the answer here is to accept that the &lt;capture-identifier&gt; \n&gt; can not be\n&gt; used directly for indexing purposes - and leave the retrieval problem \n&gt; to the\n&gt; implementation of the indexing mechanism.\n\nI agree that the &lt;capture-identifier&gt; should not be overloaded with\nallowing indexing based on request, that&#39;d be too much info to put in\nthere.  It should be solely for tying together related records.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; We have another usage scenario we would like this format to support.\n&gt; Some of the data formats in the archive may become \n&gt; obsolete/unsupported over time. \n&gt; One approach for handling this problem is storage of applications \n&gt; capable of handling/converting\n&gt; these formats. Another approach we want to support is transformation \n&gt; of (important) data at risk\n&gt; to formats still supported. An example might be transformation from \n&gt; one graphic file format (say gif),\n&gt; to another format (say tif). This might be achieved using &quot;transform&quot; \n&gt; to mark a transformed version:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; transform:http://&lt;url&gt; &lt;dest-ip&gt; &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;mime&gt; &lt;response-size&gt; \n&gt; &lt;capture-identifier&gt;\n&gt; &lt;DATA - transformed version of original data record&gt;\n&gt; metadata:transform:http://&lt;url&gt; &lt;dest-ip&gt; &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;mime&gt; \n&gt; &lt;metadata-size&gt; &lt;capture-identifier&gt;\n&gt; &lt;DATA - metadata describing details about the transformation (from \n&gt; format, to format, application, etc)&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Each time a url-object is transformed a new pair of (transform, \n&gt; metadata:transform) records\n&gt; are created, allowing sequences of format transformations.\n\nOne issue that we haven&#39;t quite resolved yet is what the various header\nfields mean in such a context.  &lt;url&gt; is obviously the same as for the\noriginal entry.  &lt;dest-IP&gt; may be the same -- I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s\nfor, anyway.  &lt;mime&gt; should be the mime-type of the current entry, to\nallow correct parsing of the entry.  &lt;response-size&gt; must be the size of\nthe entry, to allow correct parsing of the ARC file.  But what about\n&lt;timestamp&gt;?  Should it be the timestamp of the original, providing an\nextra tie-in, or should it be the time that the transform: entry is\nwritten to the ARC file?  Same considerations go for the metadata: and\nrequest: entries.  And the idea is to have the same &lt;capture-identifier&gt;\nfor all these entries derived from a single http request, right?\n\nNow that I remember it:  The mime-type assigned to the ARC file header\n(alexa/arc) and the DAT entries (alexa/dat) does not follow normal mime\nrules (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/).  This may be\nconsidered a minor problem, as they&#39;re for internal use, but it ought to\nbe something like &quot;multipart/vnd.archive.arcfile&quot; and\n&quot;text/vnd.archive.dat&quot;.  Unless we register them with IANA and can get\n&quot;multipart/arcfile&quot; and &quot;text/dat&quot; (unlikely:).\n\n-Lars\n\n\n"}}
