As most of us have nutchwax so have a dfs going \nvia =\r\nhadoop. I would be happy to test and crawl with it.\n\n\n--- In archive-crawle=\r\nr@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nuggetwheat&quot; &lt;doug@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m jus=\r\nt getting started working with Heritrix.  I&#39;ve implemented a\n&gt; Writer proce=\r\nssor called HDFSWriterProcessor to write content \ndirectly\n&gt; into the Hadoo=\r\np Distributed Filesystem.  For those of you not \nfamiliar\n&gt; with Hadoop, it=\r\n is an open source implementation of the Google File\n&gt; System and Map/Reduc=\r\ne system.  It stores files by breaking them into\n&gt; chunks and distributing =\r\nn replicas of each chunk across different\n&gt; nodes.  It allows you to do hig=\r\nh-speed distributed processing of \nyour\n&gt; crawled data reliably, using a la=\r\nrge cluster of machines.\n&gt; \n&gt; The code is mostly isolated to new source fil=\r\nes, but I had to make a\n&gt; couple of small changes to some of the existing i=\r\nnterfaces.  If \nthere\n&gt; is any interest, I&#39;m willing to offer it to the pro=\r\nject.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Doug Judd\n&gt;   www.zvents.com\n&gt;   doug@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
