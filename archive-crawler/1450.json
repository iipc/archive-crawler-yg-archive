Only ExtractorHTTP ignores the flag (It runs against the \nHTTP headers).    Here is the issue: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1111656&group_id=73833&atid=539102).\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;By the way, you might look at the\n&gt; &gt;CrawlURI#skipToProcessor(ProcessorChain) and\n&gt; &gt;CrawlURI#skipToProcessor(ProcessorChain, Processor) methods as a means\n&gt; &gt;of skipping processing (A ProcessorChain is a group of like-minded\n&gt; &gt;Processors: e.g: The Extractors all sit in one ProcessorChain).  See how\n&gt; &gt;the PreconditionEnforcer processor works for an example.\n&gt;\n&gt; I had previously looked at it and decided it was one of those things that\n&gt; should not normally  be done if there is another way....  maybe I&#39;ve got\n&gt; the wrong attitude about it.\n\nI think being able to abort the current ProcessingChain is something \npeople will want to do but there is not enough support for it just yet \n(I made an RFE to add it in the meantime).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
