With \nonly 1GB RAM, that means lots of swapping, which probably explains the \nslowness. Java heap memory usage is very non-local -- essentially by \ndesign of the garbage-collection system -- and so you always want the \nheap size to be less than RAM. I would recommend a max-heap setting of \nno more than 700MB-800MB on a 1GB machine.\n\n&gt; \tï¿½ Frontier report\n&gt; 15179 queues: 191 active (50 in-process; 31 ready; 110 snoozed); 78  \n&gt; inactive; 0 retired; 14910 exhausted\n\nI believe the swapping is enough to explain the slowdown, but this \n*might* be slightly suggestive there are a disproportionate number of \nqueues that are non-responsive. With typical politeness waits that are \n10X or more of the fetch-times, if the queues are all &#39;lively&#39; (fetching \nquickly) then the total number of ready+snoozed queues would be larger \nthan just 1.4 times the number of in-process queues, up to all the \navailable inactive queues.\n\nLooking at the full frontier report for queues that are in long \n(multi-minute) snoozes, or have odd domain names and have never made any \nprogress, will be one indication that this is happening. Connect errors \nin the &#39;local-errors.log&#39; are another indication.\n\nWhen the queues&#39; target hosts aren&#39;t responsive and not expected to \nbecome responsive, it&#39;s just an operator judgment call as to when to \nterminate the crawl.\n\nI think you&#39;ll get much better performance if you restart with a \nmax-heap (JVM -Xmx) below total RAM.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
