The highest branch is heritrix-1_6, and the highest \n&gt;&gt; version is heritrix-1_7_2 (which I assume is a dev release).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Yousef:\n&gt; \n&gt; You are right.  There is no branch for 1.8 release (and heritrix-1_7_2 \n&gt; is an internal dev release).  Sourceforge CVS was in a state of flux \n&gt; around time of the  1.8.0 release and the branch seems to have been lost.  \n&gt; \n&gt; At this stage, doing a CVS timestamp checkout is best way to get 1.8 \n&gt; source.  To find the date-to-use, look at the cvs log of project.xml.  \n&gt; See when the version number was moved to 1.8.\n&gt; \n&gt; Otherwise, get source bundle from sourceforge.\n\nMay 9 2006 would be a good date to get.\n\nA handful of commits on May 8 touched up version numbers, dates, and one \nrelease-notes ampersand-escaping issue, labelled the release, and then \nthe official 1.8 release was built.  (It can still be found on the build \nbox, at...\n\nhttp://crawltools.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/buildresults/HEAD-heritrix?log=log20060508032349Lbuild.937\n\n...which matches the 1.8.0 bundles in the Sourceforge &#39;files&#39; download \narea.)\n\nBut, soon afterward, Sourceforge CVS &#39;lost&#39; those May 8 commits. So the \n1.8 release files available as file bundles from Sourceforge &#39;files&#39; are \nin a sense from a &#39;CVS alternate history&#39; no longer visible in \nSourceforge &#39;CVS&#39;.\n\nIf it becomes necessary to do a 1.8.1 release, we&#39;d reconstruct a \n&#39;heritrix-1_8_0&#39; label. So far, though, we&#39;ve been content to leave this \nas an anomaly.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n"}}
