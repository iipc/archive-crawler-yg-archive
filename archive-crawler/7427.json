I (1) cr=\r\nawl text content only and (2) don&#39;t want to archive anything but successful=\r\n pages. I also want to have (3) strict quota rules for all servers. So far,=\r\n I&#39;ve been expanding/modifying the default job that 3.1 generates with some=\r\n success.\n\nHowever, is the following correct?\n\n- I added a QuotaEnforcer to=\r\n the CandidateScoper to enforce quotas.\n- I added a ContentTypeNotMatchesRe=\r\ngexDecideRule to the &quot;scope&quot; DecideRuleSequence, which REJECTs for regex &quot;t=\r\next&#92;/.*&quot; to download only text content.\n\nAnd finally, my primary question: =\r\nWhere do I add the FetchStatusDecideRule to store only sucessful (basically=\r\n &quot;200&quot;) pages? In 1.4, the Archiver accepted its own rule sequence. How is =\r\nthat achieved in 3.1.\n\nSorry if the question/s is/are redundant. I am under=\r\n a bit of time pressure and would normally have done more research before a=\r\nsking.\n\nThanks & cheers\nRoland\n\n\n"}}
