I&#39;m\n&gt; re-running a crawl that ran out of memory spectacularly in 1.4 (this\n&gt; with a 1G Java heap, SURT prefix scope) on a 1.5 snapshot and it has\n&gt; been able to get a bit further.\n\nThanks. Perhaps it&#39;s time for us to upgrade to 1.5.\n\nIn the meantime, I am trying to do a &quot;recovery&quot; crawl. Last time I tried, \nthe WUI did not give signs of live for a few days, at which point I decided \nto give up. Does anybody have experiences recovering very large crawls? The \nuser manual states that recovery can take hours, but is it normal to have \nto wait for days?\n\nRegards,\n\nMarco\n\n\n"}}
