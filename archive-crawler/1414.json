Sometimes these contain links to\n&gt; extensive collections of numerical data which is needed to verify\n&gt; research results. We left out this numerical data.\n&gt; * Electronic catalog entries from univerity libraries.\n&gt; * Various web calendars\n&gt;\n&gt; Crawling was made with heritrix 1.2 or earlier. Most was done in\n&gt; domain mode which turned out to be useful in university environment\n&gt; where faculties and departments tend to have numerous subdomains.\n&gt;\n&gt; Only technical universities were crawled with host scope, in order to\n&gt; keep an eye on what kind of data Heritrix was retrieving (the\n&gt; numerical research data I mentioned).\n&gt;\n&gt; In 2005 we could try crawling the entire Finnish web space with\n&gt; Heritrix. There&#39;s no exact knowledge about the number of Finnish\n&gt; domains but one estimate is about 80 000-100 000.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nice if somebody manages to compress this info into a couple of\n&gt; sentences in Heritrix pages :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards to all there,\n&gt; Kaisa Kaunonen\n&gt; Finnish National Library\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
