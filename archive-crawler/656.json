Since we no longer make regular use of this facility, it\ndoesn&#39;t offer the same level of monitoring and control of the crawl,\nbut might be useful for launching crawls as a subpart of some larger\nsystem, especially small crawls unlikely to need all administration options.\n\nIf you were to make significant use of this mode of operation, you might\nwant to add better feedback on crawl progress or ways to add/pause/adjust/cancel\ncrawls from the command-line. See for example the RFE:\n\n   [ 894467 ] Stopping, pausing, checkpointing from cmdline\n   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=894467&group_id=73833&atid=539102\n\nIf you add any capabilities here you can contribute to the codebase, let\nus know!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nstack wrote:\n&gt; jcgoodkin wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We are investigating replacing our in-houser harvester with an open \n&gt;&gt;source harvester and are seriously considering Heritrix. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nice to hear.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I was wondering if there is a way to define and send heritrix a job \n&gt;&gt;without going through the web UI. We have some existing interefaces \n&gt;&gt;that I am pretty sure we are going to want to keep, because they are \n&gt;&gt;very simple. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The Heritrix interface is very nice, and I can seeing making use of \n&gt;&gt;it as well, but it does require a fairly sophisticated user. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I would be interested to know if there is a way to run heritrix as a \n&gt;&gt;service rather than as an applicaiton.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; We intend to spend better packaging Heritrix so it can be more easily \n&gt; embedded by other apps but in the meantime, checkout how Heritrix sets \n&gt; up the selftest.  See here: \n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#584.  \n&gt; The bulk of this method is launching a webapp for the selftest to go up \n&gt; against but its the rest is a fairly contained example of a crawl setup \n&gt; and launch without use of the UI.\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;I would be interested to know if there is a way to run heritrix as a \n&gt;&gt;service rather than as an applicaiton.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thanks!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Jay\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
