I don&#39;t see how that\noption can be useful, since according to the logs from my original\npost LinkScoper was rejecting these embedded URL&#39;s but then my scope\niself was accepting them and they were getting crawled.\n\nThanks,\neric.\n\nOn Wed, Jul 05, 2006 at 02:53:33PM -0000, Frank McCown wrote:\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Eric &lt;ej@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m working on a crawl where I only want pages that are subdirs of:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.someserver.com/dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.someserver.com/dir5/dir6/\n&gt; \n&gt; Eric,\n&gt; \n&gt; I think the solution to your problem is what Gordon Mohr suggested here:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/2972\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Frank \n\n-- \nhttp://ir.iit.edu/~ej\n\n\n\n"}}
