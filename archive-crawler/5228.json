I don&#39;t yet know what&#39;s going wrong.\n\nGerwin van Doorn wrote:\n&gt; Hi!\n&gt; \n&gt; We are using Heritrix 2 as a crawler and would like to read and write\n&gt; the seed file of a job using JMX. We use the code from\n&gt; org.archive.webui.Seeds (.java, see below) but it does not work.\n&gt; \n&gt; When calling long size = engine.getFileSize(job.encode(),            \n&gt;         SETTINGS_PATH); we get an error saying root:seeds:seedsfile\n&gt; doesnt exist.  Removing this line gives the error :\n&gt; \n&gt; root:seeds:seedsFile is invalid because\n&gt; org.archive.modules.seeds.SeedModuleImpl does not define a key named\n&gt; seedsFile\n&gt; \n&gt; when calling sheetManager.getFilePath(SETTINGS_PATH)...\n&gt; \n&gt; Any hints on how to retrieve the seed file remotely using JMX?\n\nMight the job name be wrong, or the job instance somehow mismatched with \nthe job at the engine? (Can you perform any other job operations other \nthan seed viewing/changing? Can you compare the job instance at this \npoint in your code to a job instance in a working default Heritrix web UI?)\n\nWhat is the &#39;state&#39; of the job at the time you&#39;re trying to update the \nseeds?\n\nAre you doing this via an alternate control panel/web UI, or some other \ncustom code?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
