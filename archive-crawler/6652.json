It&#39;s glad to hear from you! thanks for your reply!U&#39;re\n&gt; indeed vry helpful!\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.Now that I can remember my login credentials. But can I remove the\n&gt; login page and directly go into the heritrix mainpage?\n\nIf you are visiting from the same browser without having quit and \nrelaunched the browser, you won&#39;t be prompted again. In most browsers, \neven with a quit and relaunch, the values can be saved so you won&#39;t have \nto re-type.\n\nWhy do you need to eliminate even that step? (Is there something else \nyou&#39;re trying to achieve?)\n\nYou should also review this page about why it is important to limit \naccess to the administrative interface:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Security+Considerations\n\n&gt; 2.Thanks for the depthe level setting advice ! It works!!!! and I am\n&gt; gald abt it! Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. I still don&#39;t understand how to download more than a website at\n&gt; the same time. Is it I just type in all the url addresses in the\n&gt; seeds textbox, line by line then add in once again all the url\n&gt; addresss in the http-header-user agent text box by adding &quot;+&quot; sign.\n&gt; For example: seeds text box: http://www.abc.com http://www.def.com\n&gt;\n&gt; http-header-user agent text box: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;\n&gt; heritrix/1.14.3 +http://www.abc.com +http://www.def.com)\n\nYou should not be putting the URLs of the sites you&#39;re crawling into the \n&#39;http-user-agent&#39; value!\n\nThe HTTP &#39;User-Agent&#39; header is to identify *you* to sites, allowing \nthem to contact you if anything goes wrong. The URL should be an URL \nthat describes your purpose in crawling and includes contact information \nsuch as an email address or phone number.\n\nThis is covered in the H1 User Manual, among other places:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/config.html#httpheaders\n\n&gt; 4.Why is it after we key in the url in the seed box then we need to\n&gt; re-keyin the url once agin into the http-header-user agent text box\n&gt; and somemore we need to provide our email add in the &quot;from&quot; texbox?\n&gt; It seems like doing double work. Can we simplify this? Is there any\n&gt; easier way on this?\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt; 5.I facing the remote access problem. I installed my heritrix in a\n&gt; PC, then when I using my laptop to remote access it to the PC, the\n&gt; heritrix show blank page.\n\nSee the User Manual, especially the &#39;Note&#39; under here:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/install.html#N1008F\n\n&gt; Please help me and guide me.\n\nYou should do a front-to-back read of the User Manual, review the \nproject wiki, and follow/search others&#39; questions in this discussion \nlist -- as these questions already have written answers in many places.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Thanks in advance, HyuuGaBaDita\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr&lt;gojomo@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 8/3/10 9:23 PM, HyuuGaBaDita wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. I am newbie in using Heritrix! I thk Heritrix is fantastic\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and helping me a lot! I am currently using heritrix-1.14.3. I am\n&gt;&gt;&gt; facing some problems:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.Everytimes when I login, it requires me to key in the Login\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name and password, can I avoid this by pre-setting the USername\n&gt;&gt;&gt; and password? how?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Usually a web browser will offer an option to remember login\n&gt;&gt; credentials.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.where can i set the depth level? please guide me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the default-deciding example profile, the TooManyHopsDecideRule,\n&gt;&gt; and its &#39;max-hops&#39; setting, sets a ceiling on the number of links\n&gt;&gt; followed from your starting seeds.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3.Can heritrix dopwnload more than 1 website? how? what is the\n&gt;&gt;&gt; maximumn num of websites can be archived at a time\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The maximum is limited only by your storage; just enter the right\n&gt;&gt; starting seed URIs, and configure the scope so it proceeds to any\n&gt;&gt; other related sites of interest, and you&#39;re on your way.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
