To test things, I have a class called NotProcessingProcessor\nextends Processor {...} that does not actually do anything. According to a\nnote in the developer&#39;s manual, all I have to do is write a\nProcessor.options file with the line:\n\ntesting1.NotProcessingProcessor|MyDummyProcessor\n\nthen jar the class and the Processor.options file and put that resulting jar\nfile into Heritrix/lib and then Heritrix will incorporate that processor\ninto the modules option in UI. That is exactly what I did and I don&#39;t see my\nprocessor in modules settings on the UI. What am I doing wrong?\n\nI am working with Eclipse under Mac OS.\n\nThanks in advance for any help,\n\nAnas\n\r\n--0016364163db93432c0479c39d4b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi all,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to extend Heritrix by replacing the ARCWriter with my=\r\n special writer/indexer.
