So I&#39;d guess\n&gt;I need to set up mid-fetch and writer-stage ContentTypeRegExp filters\n&gt;to only allow text/html and text/plain, and set up a pre-fetch\n&gt;URIRegExp filter with the regexp you based on Igor&#39;s posting.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nThe above sounds like a decent tactic.\n\nLeaving off the pre-fetch filter would mean that you&#39;d do content-type \nchecks only.  Might be more suited to your purposes.  Would mean that \nthe crawler does more fetches but you might get text/* content that came \nfrom ruled-out file endings.\n\n&gt;Regular expressions are not my strong suit though, so would I add just\n&gt;a filter for each content type, or a single combined one?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nOne regex would probably be more performant.  Would a regex of \n&#39;^&#92;s*text/.*$&#39; suit your purposes?  This would get text/plain, \ntext/html, text/xml, etc. (It matches anything that may or may not have \nleading whitespace followed by &#39;text/&#39; followed by anything).  Be aware \nthat the mimetype test will go against content-type strings that could \nlook like this: &#39;text/html; charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; which you want your \ncontent-type regex to include (The above suggested regex will work for \nsuch a case).\n\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Rob.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Tom Emerson &lt;Tree@b...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;robeger writes:\n&gt;&gt;[...]\n&gt;&gt;    \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I was hoping to find some documentation on the ContextTypeRegExp\n&gt;&gt;&gt;filtering.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;      \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What in particular would you like to know?
