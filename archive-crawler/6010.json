How do I request a =\r\ncrawl stop in a processor (innerProcess())?\n\nI found the method requestCraw=\r\nlStop() in the CrawlController but wasn&#39;t able to find out how I get to my =\r\nCrawlController inside of a processor&#39;s innerProcess() method!?\n\n----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.) I have a =\r\nlist which I instantiate in the initialTasks() method of one of my processo=\r\nrs and I would like to make sure that this list is only accessed by one toe=\r\nthread at a time (in the innerProcess() method of the referring processor o=\r\nf the toethread). How can I make sure that this list is only accessed by on=\r\ne toethread at a time?\n\nI&#39;m not really solid in multhithreading and this is=\r\n kinda new problem to me. I looked into wait() and notify() methods and som=\r\ne general stuff but couldn&#39;t really figure something for Heritrix so I woul=\r\nd appreciate any help on this!\n\nThanks for the help!!!\n\nGeorgie\n\n\n\n\n"}}
