I tried using 2.0.1 recently (Was trying to help along the\n&gt; hbase-writer effort: http://code.google.com/p/hbase-writer/\n&gt; &lt;http://code.google.com/p/hbase-writer/&gt;). I had a\n&gt; similar experience. I had to authenticate every time I submittted a\n&gt; form and then it&#39;d NPE more often than it&#39;d work. Whats up w/ 2.0.x?\n&gt; Is it being used by anyone?\n&gt; \n&gt; Was also wondering about the move to Apache-licensing project that was\n&gt; talked of a while back up on the list?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean-Noël Rivasseau wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am using Heritrix 2.0.1. &lt;http://2.0.1.&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I created a sheet that is associated to www.example.com\n&gt;&gt; &lt;http://www.example.com &lt;http://www.example.com&gt;&gt;. This sheet has its\n&gt; own root, root:scope, and\n&gt;&gt; root:scope:deciderules sequence. However everytime I launch the crawl,\n&gt;&gt; it seems like only the settings from the global sheet are used... Eg,\n&gt;&gt; if I have there a single RejectRule, the crawl instantly stops.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In my experience, Heritrix is awesome as a crawl engine, but\n&gt;&gt; configuration is completely buggy. Not only does the web GUI is not\n&gt;&gt; very convenient, but so far I have had troubles with it almost\n&gt;&gt; everytime I try to use a different sheet than the global one... the\n&gt;&gt; only way to achieve something is to use the global one.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Am I missing something or should I report a bug? (I already reported\n&gt;&gt; several related to the configuration interface)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jean-Noel\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PS: and trying to mix rules from the global sheet and another sheet is\n&gt;&gt; a nightmare, moving them up and down always fail because it seems the\n&gt;&gt; indexes are not maintained correctly. This is probably actually not\n&gt;&gt; supported.\n&gt;&gt;\n\n"}}
