It tells the browser what area of=\r\n\nthe website the browser is currently viewing, and allows the browser\nto pa=\r\nss back it&#39;s credentials for that realm. A realm could be any string.\n\nA fa=\r\nilure of Heritrix to match a realm with a credential should result\nin a log=\r\n entry that describes what realm failed. You should be able to\ncopy/paste t=\r\nhat realm into the deciderule.\n\nThe reason there is a realm string is it al=\r\nlows the server to divided\nthe space into sections. So that a credential th=\r\nat works for one realm\nwon&#39;t work for another.\n\nSometimes the realm is the =\r\nword &quot;Basic&quot;, other times servers use the\nweb masters e-mail address.\n\nI&#39;m =\r\nnot sure how to discover the realm using FireFox?\n\nWhen I try to access a U=\r\nRL using FireFox it that displays the\n&quot;Authentication Required&quot; dialog. Whe=\r\nre is says &quot;Enter username and\npassword for &#39;&#39;&quot;. The text that is in quotes=\r\n might be the realm?\n\nor it might be the root URL.\n\nEither way, it&#39;s a stri=\r\nng provided by the server.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sajib =\r\nDasgupta&quot;\n&lt;sajib44new@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; I am trying to crawl password-p=\r\nrotected websites with Heritrix.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have added the \n&gt; org.archive.crawl=\r\ner.datamodel.credential.Rfc2617Credential  \n&gt; \n&gt; And, then in the settings =\r\nsection, I have given the domain name, user \n&gt; name and password.

What should I do?\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\ns there any other setting I have to change in Heritrix?\n&gt; \n&gt; I also tried w=\r\nith http://user:password@.../ but, Heritrix \n&gt; does not work either.\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\nlease help me out.
