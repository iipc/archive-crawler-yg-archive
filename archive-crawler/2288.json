Since I have several urls that=\r\n I wanted to crawl but one of the\n&gt; url is disallowing /\n&gt; images/ director=\r\ny with robots.txt, but I wanted to crawl the images.  At the\n&gt; same time, I=\r\n don&#39;t \n&gt; want to ignore other urls&#39; robots.txt.  Also I don&#39;t want to sepa=\r\nrate the\n&gt; url in different job.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thx,\n&gt; Jay\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n&gt; \n&gt; YAHOO!
