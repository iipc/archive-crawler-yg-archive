My experience of RMI under load is that it&#39;s a bit  \nflaky and what&#39;s worse is that its &#39;flaky&#39; as opposed to right out  \nbreaking so you find the odd call not happening properly. I did a  \nfair amount of load testing on it and decided that it was  \nrubbish :-). I also load tested RMI over IIOP and couldn&#39;t manage to  \nload it enough to break it at all.\n\nI&#39;ve used JMS in JBoss quite a lot too and you might find that it  \nprovides a good way of providing resilience as machines come and go.  \nI can&#39;t remember the ins and outs but from what I remember one of the  \nconfigurations don&#39;t cope well with lots of small messages though.\n\nFor dynamic configuration of the server farm have you considered  \nJINI. Its a really nice technology for this kind of thing - you can  \nadd and remove components from a large system in a true &#39;plug and  \nplay&#39; fashion. Its a little bit fiddley to get working with &#39;pure&#39;  \nJ2EE but you can make it work in JBoss.\n\ncheers\n\nmark\n\n\nOn 17 Aug 2005, at 20:26, stack wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve added some notes on multimachine crawling to the wiki, here:\n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl? \n&gt; MultimachineCrawl#practical.\n&gt; It&#39;d be great to hear people&#39;s feedback on how they think a &#39;hive of\n&gt; heritrices&#39; might coordinate to achieve a large-scale crawl.\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
