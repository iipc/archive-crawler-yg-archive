So compared to something like  \nhttrack it will seem slow.\n\nYou need to make sure your scope is setup properly so that the  \ncrawler doesn&#39;t just wander off over the internet. For a single site  \nthe domain scope is great. As you get more experience you can  \nexperiment with the others. Read the help text carefully.\n\nThe next port of call for a beginner are the logs - they will let you  \nsee what is going on during the crawl. If it wanders off or does  \nsomething unexpected you can pause it and tweak the settings mid run.  \nBy watching these and experimenting you will get a good feel for what  \nthe various settings do. Crawling your own site is always a good  \nstarting point because you know what its there and exactly what to  \nexpect.\n\nLastly (but certainly not least) - upgrade to a more recent version  \nof Heritirx if you can - 1.4 has lots of little features that make  \nusing it a more pleasant experience. Well worth the effort.\n\ncheers\n\nmark\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 8 Oct 2005, at 19:34, ashwind18 wrote:\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am kind of new to the Heritrix crawler and i am currently using it\n&gt; for some project.\n&gt;\n&gt; What i noticed when crawling my site was that the crawler seems to\n&gt; keep crawling for quite some time. It took me about 8 hours to crawl\n&gt; my site, which is a small site. Is this normal or have i configured\n&gt; the crawler wrongly?\n&gt;\n&gt; What i am confused is that the crawler just seems to crawl on and on,\n&gt; as if it were crawling the site again or going out of the scope. Or\n&gt; perhaps the crawler was waiting for some downloads or processes.\n&gt;\n&gt; The configuration i used were pretty much the default settings, which\n&gt; means i just entered the project site and the email requirements.\n&gt; Other than those, i left the settings unchanged.\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, i am currently using Heritrix 1.2.0.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can someone please enlighten me? Your attention is kindly appreciated.\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt; Adrian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
