If it is not,\nas is frequently the case with Javascript-based menus, Heritrix stands\nlittle chance of finding out right now.\n\nStoring and re-running the Javascript itself is not a problem, the\nproblem is to make sure you get the URLs it refers to.  Two possible\nsolutions we have considered are\n\n1) Run the page through an actual browser that allows crawling the DOM\nand grab all the URLs encountered.  That&#39;d find those URLs that are\ncreated at page loading time, but not such as are created due to user\nactions.  Not too hard to do, if you can find a browser that interacts\nwell.  Probably very CPU-consuming, though.\n\n2) Make a partial evaluator that attempts to decide what URLs can be\ncreated in Javascript.  Most Javascript code I&#39;ve looked at is fairly\nregular and would be highly amenable to partial evaluation. This would\nbe a major undertaking, and would also require something that\nunderstands the DOM.  We&#39;ve considered passing this off to students as a\nmasters or Ph.D. project, we certainly don&#39;t have the resources\nourselves.  \n\n3) Do a manual quality check with a proxy server that notices the URLs\nclicked but not found.  This sounds like a lot of work, but with a\nlimited number of sites it can get big improvements in the workings of\nthe archived copy, as typically only a few essential menu URLs are\nmissing.\n\n-Lars\n\n\n\n"}}
