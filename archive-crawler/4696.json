If so i=\r\nt returns true, otherwise \nit returns false.\n\nA filter could be used in sev=\r\neral places in the crawler. Most \nnotably is the use of filters in the Scop=\r\ne. Aside that, filters are \nalso used in processors. Filters applied to pro=\r\ncessors always filter \nURIs out. That is to say that any URI matching a fil=\r\nter on a \nprocessor will effectively skip over that processor. This can be =\r\n\nuseful to disable (for instance) link extraction on documents coming \nfrom=\r\n a specific section of a given website.\n\nAll Filters should subclass the Fi=\r\nlter class. Creating a filter is \njust a matter of implementing the innerAc=\r\ncepts(Object) method. \nBecause of the planned overhaul of the scopes and fi=\r\nlters, we will \nnot provide a extensive example of how to create a filter a=\r\nt this \npoint. It should be pretty easy though to follow the directions in =\r\n\nthe javadoc. For your filter to show in the application interface, \nyou&#39;ll=\r\n need to edit src/conf/modules/Filter.options\n-----------------------------=\r\n-------\n\nI have writed a filter class,but i have not know  how to apply it?=\r\n\nsomebody can tell me ? Thank you. \n\n\n"}}
