I just moved on to Ubuntu 9.04, only to find Heritrix&#39;s control inter=\r\nface broken here.  The first thing I noticed was that while I can still sta=\r\nrt Heritrix and get into the WUI console to create jobs, major parts of con=\r\nsole functionality are lost. For example, if I try to Shut down Heritrix so=\r\nftware I get as far as the &quot;Are you sure?&quot; screen, I can go no further. Whe=\r\nnever I click on &quot;I&#39;m sure, shut it down&quot; - nothing happens.  However, clic=\r\nking on &quot;Cancel&quot; does cause the request to vanish.  Yet the only way I can =\r\nshut down Heritrix is by rebooting my system (I haven&#39;t tried killing the p=\r\nrocess. The shutdown script is DOA.)\n\nTrying to start a job also fails.  I =\r\ncan create a job.  The modules button should take me to the configuration p=\r\nage.  But no, it just returns me to the Jobs page which shows the pending j=\r\nob I&#39;m trying to create.  However, I can click on the &quot;Edit configuration&quot; =\r\noption, which gets me to the configuration page.  Only problem is then ther=\r\ne&#39;s no way to get to the &quot;Submit job&quot; button.  I have to use my browser&#39;s b=\r\nack button to get to the console window with that tab.  But if I click it H=\r\neritrix looses all my configuration options.\n\nIt&#39;s obvious that something i=\r\ns upsetting normal script functionality here.  Can somebody help me idenitf=\r\ny this problem?\n\nRich B.\n\n\n"}}
