It can be because the port it&#39;s seeking to use \nis already taken, or there are problems with the Java version on the \nmachine. So suggestions include:\n\n(1) View any heritrix_out.log or heritrix_dmesg.log file that may be \ncreated; it may have additional info.\n\n(2) Set the environment variable &#39;FOREGROUND&#39; to &#39;true&#39; before launching \nto see Heritrix output in the launch shell (rather than for it to just \ntry reporting its startup before returning you to the shell prompt).\n\n(3) Make sure you&#39;re using the recommended version of Java: the \nSun/Oracle 1.6+ JDK.\n\n(4) Make sure nothing else is running on the port configured to be the \nadministrative interface (usually 8080).\n\nHeritrix can crawl through an HTTP proxy -- it requires extra \nconfiguration of the FetchHTTP processor -- but the failure to that \nwould show up as a different, later problem than this.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 4/4/11 12:52 AM, shashidhar wrote:\n&gt; I am installing Monkey-spider... during the process of which I need to install and run heritrix...\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve downloaded heritrix-1.14.4 and followed the steps for installation as described in http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/install.html\n&gt;\n&gt; I did as described in section &quot;Running Heritrix&quot; in the above link.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now when I type :   % $HERITRIX_HOME/bin/heritrix --help\n&gt;\n&gt; I get\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mon Apr  4 12:59:54 IST 2011 Starting heritrix .................... .........................................................................................................................................................................................\n&gt;\n&gt; just the dots are appearing continuously but heritrix isn&#39;t starting even after 30-40min.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am working from University Campus: The campus has a Proxy server.
