This would entail co-designing and co-developing (with me) an \ninfrastructure using existing open-source software like heritrix and \nnutchwax, but also developing new software for processing, cataloging, \nvisualizing, delivery and integration with our digital preservation repository.\n\nI believe that this job posting will be closed sometime next week. We&#39;ve \nhad some applicants but no one yet already familiar with web archiving. \nHere&#39;s the official description:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Library Digital Initiative program of the Harvard University Library \nhas funded a multi year project to develop a curated web site archiving \nsolution.  We seek a Java software developer to work in a 2 person software \nteam to develop the system and explore the capture and preservation issues \nsurrounding this initiative. We&#39;ll be working closely with archivists and \nacademic staff to define harvesting, preservation and discovery \nrequirements and build easy to use software tools for capturing diverse web \nsites that include women&#39;s blogs, web sites related to the constitutional \nrevision process in Japan, and web sites for Harvard departments. Over a \ntwo year period, we will build a robust, extensible solution integrated \nwith the Harvard Digital Repository Service.\n\nIf interested in pursuing this exciting project, see the Harvard University \njob listing site, \n&lt;http://www.employment.harvard.edu/&gt;http://www.employment.harvard.edu/, and \nsearch for job requisition number 25878. For more information, feel free to \ncontact me.\n\nRandy Stern\nHarvard University Library Office for Information Systems\nManager of Systems Development\nemail: &lt;mailto:randy_stern@...&gt;randy_stern@...\nphone: 617-495-3724\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nthanks,\nAndrea \n\n\n\n"}}
