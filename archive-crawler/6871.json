Or you \ncan go directly to the project JIRA issue tracker, where anyone can \nregister, submit issues, and comment:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER\n\n&gt; If it is this list, I have two:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. A configuration option whether or not Heritrix should try to\n&gt; discover new URLs in 404-pages. As a default, I think it should not\n&gt; (now it does). This feature will help preventing crawler traps.\n\nI&#39;ve made an issue for this:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1848\n\nThe existing ExtractorHTML setting &#39;ignoreUnexpectedHTML&#39; may be of some \nhelp in such cases -- it suppresses HTML link-extraction for certain \nURLs whose format strongly suggests they should have been some other \nmedia type, as is the case for some &#39;soft 404&#39; situations -- but I agree \nwe should offer a more general discovery-suppression for 404 errors.\n\nNote that a possible workaround in the meantime is to add a \nshouldProcess DecideRule to relevant extractors that answers &#39;REJECT&#39; \nfor 404s (and possibly other error codes). The FetchStatusDecideRule or \nScriptedDecideRule could be used for this purpose.\n\n&gt; 2. Support for the canonical link element (see\n&gt; http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html).\n&gt; This should be configurable. When support is enabled (default should\n&gt; be &#39;disabled&#39;) only the canonical pages should be written. As an\n&gt; extra option it should be configurable whether / how far non\n&gt; canonical pages (ie. pages that have a non empty canonical link\n&gt; element) should be followed for detecting new URLs. Again, this\n&gt; feature will help preventing crawler traps (although I think the\n&gt; element isnï¿½t widely applied yet) and might support better\n&gt; accessibility of the content of web archives).\n\nI&#39;ve made an issue for this as well:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1849\n\nIn practice, I don&#39;t know whether this link-relation will be a strong \nguarantee that the &#39;canonical&#39; URI is the better one to store, or that \nthe non-canonical URIs should be discarded. For example, even in \nGoogle&#39;s example of a &#39;good example&#39; at Wikia, discarding the \nnon-canonical fetch would lose information about terms considered \nsynonyms, and possibly break inlinks to archive URLs that would have \nworked for analogous URLs on the original site. So this might be a \nvaluable signal, but not in exactly the manner intended by its \nsearch-index originators.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
