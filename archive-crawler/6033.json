Can you try launching that way, \nand see if it works?\n\nRegarding your alternate approach, if it works on your machine, but not \nothers, it must be a packaging problem or other difference between your \nsetup and your classmates.\n\nWatch the process output and/or heritrix_out.log for any errors that are \nclues to what&#39;s going wrong or missing.\n\nIf the process seems to be active but not doing anything, you can see \nwhere (if anywhere) key threads are by requesting a Java threads stack \ndump. (Send the process SIGQUIT, and watch its STDERR, or use the \n&#39;jstack&#39; utility provided with Java as the same user, passing the JVM \nprocess-ID.) This may reveal if your main thread, or others, are stuck \nin unexpected ways.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nzhongkem2008 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for yesterday&#39;s answer!\n&gt; first,say something about my project:\n&gt; 1.I wrote some processors for my own need,for example:MyWsdlWriter which \n&gt; extends MirrorWriterProcessor only writes things I&#39;m interested in.\n&gt; 2.then everything goes well in WUI,I can download what I want!But,every \n&gt; time I want start a job,I should only start from the WUT,it&#39;s so \n&gt; trouble.Because these jobs only different in seeds,other configure are \n&gt; Exactly the same..so\n&gt; 3.I  wrote a GUI,hope everytime I only need write down the URL,then can \n&gt; start a job,the main code like:\n&gt; \n&gt;     String crawlOrderFile = &quot;.&#92;&#92;jobs&#92;&#92;order.xml&quot;;\n&gt;     CrawlStatusListener listener = null;    \n&gt;     XMLSettingsHandler handler = new XMLSettingsHandler(new File(\n&gt;       crawlOrderFile));     \n&gt;     handler.initialize();\n&gt;     controller = new CrawlController();\n&gt;     controller.initialize(handler);    \n&gt;     if (listener != null) {\n&gt;      controller.addCrawlStatusListener(listener);\n&gt;     }\n&gt; \n&gt;   controller.requestCrawlStart();  ///////\n&gt; \n&gt; everything goes well,now I only need input new URLs  or just change the \n&gt; seed.txt,the job can start right now!\n&gt; \n&gt; but,when I last decide to jar the project ,so that I can share it with \n&gt; my classmates,problem comes up!it can&#39;t start,after examine:\n&gt; \n&gt; the program stop at  controller.requestCrawlStart();  ///////,it may \n&gt; mean the method  requestCrawlStart()can&#39;t finish nomally!\n&gt; \n&gt; I wander:Is my intention wrong? or there are something should do before \n&gt; jar the project?\n&gt; \n&gt; wish for your Answers!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
