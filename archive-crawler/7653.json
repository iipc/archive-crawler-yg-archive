We dont have craw=\r\nl-report.logs nor crawl.logs from whole history of our harvests. And we don=\r\n&#39;t have hadoop infrastructure to make fast map-reduce operations.\n\nSo conte=\r\nmporary approach is to work with arcreader utility: find /archives/ -name &#39;=\r\n*arc.gz*&#39; -exec ./arcreader -d false &#39;{}&#39; &#92;; &gt; arcs.cdx then getting rid of=\r\n patterns&quot;CDX b e a m s c v n g&quot; and &quot;filedesc://&quot; and finaly counting line=\r\ns with wc -l resulting with number of documents in our archive.\n\nIs there a=\r\nny more faster or more precise apporach?  Occasionally arcreader doesnt lik=\r\ne entries in ARC files regarding corrupt Zips (invalid stored block lengths=\r\n, corrupt GZIP traielers etc.) or by means of whole corrupted ARC (*.arc.gz=\r\n is not an Internet Archive ARC file). Such stastics are depedening on arcr=\r\neader ability to read properly ARC files and there is chance that statistic=\r\n will change with new version of arcreader.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nrudolf\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
