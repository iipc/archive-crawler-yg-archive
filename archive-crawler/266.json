It propagates these to all components it\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;believes needs checkpointing. Those may further propagate the\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;messages. Any POJO can implement the interface, but that&#39;s no\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;guarantee it will be called; there&#39;s got to be a chain of\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;intentional calls from the CrawlController down.\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt; For consistency with existing code this should be done with the Event\n&gt; &gt; model.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure; the checkpoint process will likely need to enforce a\n&gt; &gt; stronger sense of ordering than is typical when simply registering\n&gt; &gt; for a notification that an event (&quot;checkpoint begun&quot;, &quot;checkpoint\n&gt; &gt; ended&quot;) has occurred. A tighter coupling may be inevitable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok.\n&gt; \nI can&#39;t see that this couldn&#39;t be achieved with the event model. As far\nas I can see is the only difference that the modules register themselves\nfor a checkpoint event instead of some mechanism that searches through\nmemory for all objects implementing Checkpointable. In both scenarios a\nmethod will be called on the module notifying that it should do the\ncheckpoint. Is there something I have missed here?\n\n- john\n\n\n"}}
