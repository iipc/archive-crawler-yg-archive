Could anyone tell me what exactly you need to do befor=\r\ne it will run a crawl and start returning pages? \n&gt; Unless I&#39;ve totally mis=\r\nunderstood what needs to be done..\n&gt; \n&gt; Any help would be much appreciated.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\nThank you all for the replies.\nAh ok, the first String you&#39;re passing t=\r\no the main will be your username:password, but what exactly are the other 3=\r\n?
