Until then, you may want to consider generating your own\n&gt;  snapshot for your end users, as documented in the site docs (do note\n&gt;  that since cron is disabled on the shell server you will have to kick\n&gt;  off the cron job from a non-SF.net host).\n&gt;\n&gt;this problem effects Heritrix as well as other projects whose first\n&gt;letter starts with a, c, d, g, u, w, and x.\n&gt;\n&gt;The CruiseControl builds stop at at 8/12, which is just before the\n&gt;hardware failure at SF: presumably it uses pserver access to get the\n&gt;latest CVS HEAD snap?\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
