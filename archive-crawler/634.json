We have some existing interefaces \n&gt;that I am pretty sure we are going to want to keep, because they are \n&gt;very simple. \n&gt;\n&gt;The Heritrix interface is very nice, and I can seeing making use of \n&gt;it as well, but it does require a fairly sophisticated user. \n&gt;\n&gt;I would be interested to know if there is a way to run heritrix as a \n&gt;service rather than as an applicaiton.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nWe intend to spend better packaging Heritrix so it can be more easily \nembedded by other apps but in the meantime, checkout how Heritrix sets \nup the selftest.  See here: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/Heritrix.html#584.  \nThe bulk of this method is launching a webapp for the selftest to go up \nagainst but its the rest is a fairly contained example of a crawl setup \nand launch without use of the UI.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;Thanks!\n&gt;\n&gt;Jay\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
