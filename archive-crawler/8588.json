Does the &quot;no \nprogress&quot; state happen 100% of the time when such warnings are seen, and \n0% of the time after other resumes where no warnings are seen?\n\nIn the event that the resumption runs for a while, but then enters the \nno-progress state later, are there any other errors around the time \nprogress stops? Do other indicators (queues with ready URIs) suggest \nprogress should be faster?\n\nWhat operating system, JVM, and filesystem? Is the crawler &#39;state&#39; \ndirectory on a local volume?\n\nI haven&#39;t looked at that code in a while, but at first glance it seems \nodd to me that the same serial-numbered JDB file (00000623) appears \ntwice in the output.\n\nIIRC, the very last JDB file of the crawler at the moment of \ncheckpointing is handled specially: its current size is remembered in \nthe checkpoint, so that even as the normal (original) run continues to \ngrow it, if the checkpoint is ever resumed, it can be truncated to the \nright size to represent the state at the moment-of-checkpointing.\n\nSo it isn&#39;t completely unexpected for a file of name \n&quot;00000623.jdb,9244478&quot; to be temporarily longer than the expected \n9244478 bytes: that&#39;s the reason for the &quot;,9244478&quot; suffix. It is odd \nfor a warning to be generated during resumption, and the same \nserial-number to be mentioned twice.\n\nPerhaps something in your OS/filesystem is preventing the file from \nbeing truncated back to its desired size? Looking in other on-disk logs \n(such as heritrix_out.log or the job alerts), there *might* be full \nerror-stacks for the WARNINGs somewhere, pointing at the exact lines of \ncode whose expectations are first failing.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\nOn 8/17/14, 1:49 AM, &#39;Markus.Mirsberger&#39; markus.mirsberger@... \n[archive-crawler] wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; as a kind of backup we automatically checkpoint long time crawls regularly.\n&gt; When I have to restart a crawl from the checkpoints I sometimes notice the following warnings.\n&gt; These are &quot;only&quot; warninngs but nevertheless the crawl doesnt run correct anymore.\n&gt; It stops crawling after some time or doesnt even start ... this means crawlspeed is at 0.00 for days (forever).\n&gt; In this case I have to restart the crawl with an older, working checkpoint and everything is ok.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you have any idea what might cause this error?
