I just committed an attempt at a fix. We are checking for\n&gt; the JMX_PORT being null when creating the Heritrix instance MBean name\n&gt; -- the JMX_PORT is part of the name if its not null -- but were not\n&gt; doing the same when creating the CrawlJob name (CrawlJob name also tries\n&gt; to include JMX_PORT in its name).\n&gt;\n&gt; In standalone mode, Heritrix starts up the JVM&#39;s JMX Agent and registers\n&gt; its MBeans here for remote clients to come visit. JMX_PORT\n&gt; (overrideable) is used to tell the JVM what port to set its JMX\n&gt; listening on.\n&gt;\n&gt; When running in a container, the JVM JMX Agent may or may not be running\n&gt; but Heritrix assumes the container has a JMX Agent of its own running.\n&gt; They usually do. Tomcat does. Heritrix binds to the first Agent it\n&gt; finds (It should probably be more discriminate than this but will wait\n&gt; until there is a complaint before doing anything about it). So, there\n&gt; may be no JMX_PORT defined though there is a JMX Agent present for\n&gt; Heritrix to use.\n&gt;\n&gt; A refactoring of the crawl job name a while back seems to have\n&gt; introduced the bug. Let us know if the fix works for you.\n&gt;\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt; hlm_bk wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t run a crawl job, it fails at ht.put(JmxUtils.JMX_PORT,\n&gt; &gt; hht.get(JmxUtils.JMX_PORT)); line of code in\n&gt; &gt; org.archive.crawler.admin.CrawlJob when i start my job.\n&gt; &gt; hht.get(JmxUtils.JMX_PORT) returns null and null pointer exception \n&gt; arises.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Where can i specify jmx port?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i&#39;m even not sure if there&#39;s a jmx agent running. Maybe it&#39;s possible\n&gt; &gt; to tell heritrix to run without jmx support?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My configuration:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Heritrix 1.10.0\n&gt; &gt; Tomcat 5.5.17\n&gt; &gt; Java 1.5.0_03\n&gt; &gt; Windows XP Pro\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thank you1\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n\n"}}
