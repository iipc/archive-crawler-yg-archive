This talks about the\n&gt; notions to be adhered while using this module.\n\nReviewing this document (&quot;CVSInstructions.txt&quot;), I don&#39;t \nfully agree with putting everything in a single CVS\nmodule. \n\nIn particular, I still want to use a separate module --\ncurrently called &#39;Design&#39; but to be renamed &#39;Project&#39; --\nto capture high-level project documents and proposals\nin progress. These are largely separable from the full\nbuild environment, and perhaps of interest to a larger\naudience. \n\nDeveloper documentation of what written (or soon to be \nwritten) code actually does, and basic user documentation for\nthe sake of launching/configuring the crawler, still\nbelongs in the /docs/ directory of the main module. \n\nAlso, while I initially thought including all 3rd-party \nlibraries inside the project in both their distro form\nand usable form was a very good idea, I see that it runs\nafould of SourceForge&#39;s recommendations, which frown\nupon the use of CVS to store large/unchanging materials. \nIt&#39;s also leading to a lot of redundant copies of libraries\nwhen I&#39;m working with both our several modules and perhaps \neven the home modules of the libraries in question.\n\nFor now, I think we can continue this practice of\n&quot;include it all&quot;, but we may need to revisit this eventually.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
