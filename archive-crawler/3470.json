In this case I would have expected to\n&gt; see a similar (approx 77,000) number of 200 responses that would have\n&gt; been crawled.\n&gt; Any ideas on why the &quot;successful&quot; page count is so low in this case?\n\nSome theories:\n\n- They might all be redirects to a small number of target pages (like a \nlogin page)\n- They might be redirects to out-of-scope URLs (which are ignored).\n\nAre a large number of URLs pending in the queue for the target domain?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
