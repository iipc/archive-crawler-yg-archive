Only that for the crawler, with all of its various \nordering tendencies and the delays it encountered, happened to discover \nthe &#39;LLLL&#39; path first. (If the first &#39;L&#39; of that short &#39;LL&#39; path was on \na slow host, or on a host that already had hours or days worth of URIs \nqueued up, then by the time it is crawled, the other &#39;LLLL&#39; path has \nalready finished. Thus the &#39;LL&#39; discovery path is rejected as providing \na non-unique URI, and never enters the crawler queues/crawl.log.)\n\nIf you want a &#39;web graph&#39; of all paths (or all shortest paths) between \nURIs, that&#39;s usually calculated via a big post-crawl analysis.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 1/20/12 12:04 PM, Noah Levitt wrote:\n&gt; Hello Ng Zi Kai,\n&gt;\n&gt; You can determine the number of hops from seed by looking at the\n&gt; path-from-seed, which is the 5th column in crawl.log. The number of\n&gt; letters in that field is the number of hops from seed (unless it&#39;s\n&gt; more than 50 hops in which case it will be abbreviated).\n&gt;\n&gt; It is possible to write separate crawl logs for the different numbers\n&gt; of hops, but it&#39;s not simple to configure. My suggestion would be to\n&gt; split the crawl log up in a postprocessing step, by examining the\n&gt; path-from-seed for each crawled url.\n&gt;\n&gt; Noah\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On 2012-01-12 19:09 , ngzikai92 wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This might be a little confusing, and I am just starting out.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If we think about Heritrix, we can see it like a &#39;tree structure&#39;\n&gt;&gt; where the seed url is at the top layer, the additional urls that\n&gt;&gt; are found from the root at the second layer, and the urls that are\n&gt;&gt; found from the the additional urls at the third layer, and so on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Currently, based on what I can get from Heritrix&#39;s crawl.log, I am\n&gt;&gt; only able to see the list of urls Heritrix found/visits as a list,\n&gt;&gt; but I am not able to determine the layers of the &#39;tree structure&#39;\n&gt;&gt; from there.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I would like to know, if it is possible to customise Heritrix in\n&gt;&gt; such a way that I can crawl layer by layer and separating the urls\n&gt;&gt; obtained from each layer into separate log files?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Much thanks and regards, Ng Zi Kai\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
