I w=\r\nould like to setup H3 on two (maybe more in the future) machines for a dist=\r\nributed crawl.  I would also like to apply the HashCrawlMapper to the proce=\r\nssing chains so the URIs are shared between the two crawlers. \n\nAlthough th=\r\nere are discussions about multiple machine crawls and the use of HashCrawlM=\r\napper, I could not find specifics on the setup of this (i.e even an example=\r\n crawler-beans.cxml with a default configuration).   I understand that both=\r\n crawlers should have the same configuration.  However, how do you assign a=\r\n crawler/node name to each so that the HashCrawlMapper can assign URIs and =\r\neach crawler understands which ones to crawl.?\n\nAdditionally, when attempti=\r\nng to define a name bean for the HashCrawlMapper I am unclear on how to ide=\r\nntify the available property names and values.  (And this is true for any b=\r\nean that is not clearly defined as the default crawler-beans.cxml.)\n\nI unde=\r\nrstand that the customization of the configuration for optimal performance =\r\nmay take many iterations, but can anyone help me define the initial configu=\r\nration of a two crawler/machine system which would work as a distributed cr=\r\nawl.\n\nThank you,\n\n-David\n\n\n"}}
