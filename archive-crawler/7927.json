For the initial start do I really have  to use a seeds file or is \nthere a way to tell heritrix to check the actionfolder when the job is \nstarted?\n2. What possibilities do I have when the job finished before I can add \nnew seeds to the action dir or if the job finished before it checked the \naction dir again?\n\nI did hope that heritrix has maybe something like a listener on the \naction directory and automatically picks these seeds up and if finished \nthe job only sleeps and keeps checking the action directory.\nBut the only way I see now is adding a seeds file to the main directory \nand (re)start the job to get it running and checking the action \ndirectory again.\nDid I miss something in the configuration or is this really the intended \nbehaviour?\n\n\nRegards,\nMarkus\n\n\n\n"}}
