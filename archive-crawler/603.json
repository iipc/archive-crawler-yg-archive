Checking the console showed me that only 4 documents had been\n&gt;downloaded. Egads. Investigation shows that the heritrix log file was\n&gt;over 150G (yes, gigabytes), which is what ate up my disk.\n&gt;\n&gt;Suffice it to say I was a bit non-plussed by this.\n&gt;\n&gt;Did logging verbosity increase tremendously in 0.10.0?\n&gt;\n&gt;Has anyone else seen very verbose logging going on?\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;m going to try to reproduce this, but I thought I&#39;d ping the list to\n&gt;see if anything like this is happening to others.\n&gt;\n&gt;    -tree\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
