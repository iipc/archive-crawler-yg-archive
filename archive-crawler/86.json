I \nstill only assigned it 384MB of heap space. \n\nIt ran for about 10 minutes before gumming up, mostly with out-of-memory\nerrors, which slowed its progress to a trickle. \n\nIn that time it collected over 27,000 URIs, resulting in about 98MBs of \ncompressed arc.gz information. (That&#39;d be about 220MBs uncompressed.)\n\nSo the rates per this &quot;burst&quot; crawl are approximately:\n - 45 resources/URIs per second\n - 350K of uncompressed archivable material per second\n\nSimply offering it more memory would likely result in a nearly-linear\ngrowth in URIs visited before memory exhaustion, but most likely at a \nslower rate.\n\nIt&#39;s reasonable to project that, before further optimization, we\ncould scale up about 6 times by using more of the available memory:\naround 150,000 visited URIs in a bit over an hour. \n\n- Gordon\n\n\n\n"}}
