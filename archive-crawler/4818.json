Some of\nour conc=\r\nerns may come from not knowing enough yet about the new sheets\nway of confi=\r\nguring jobs.\n\nWe think that the crawl configuration is important enough to =\r\ndeposit\ninto our preservation repository along with its associated harvest =\r\nso\nwe have recently developed a mets profile for web harvests that embeds\nt=\r\nhe order.xml within it. We also have a lot of related code, etc.\nbuilt to c=\r\nreate and work with these.  The existing schema for the\norder.xml works wel=\r\nl enough for our needs to be able to validate the\norder.xml file. With the =\r\nsheets way of configuration is there a way to\nserialize the configuration t=\r\no a file? And can we generate the\nconfiguration without using the web inter=\r\nface? When you are embedding\ncontent into a mets file the XML format is eas=\r\niest but if the sheets\ncan be serialized to some format we could find a way=\r\n to include or\npoint to it.\n\nMy other concern with heritrix 2.0 is that hcc=\r\n is incompatible with\nit. How incompatible? Is this just in the short-term =\r\nor is  hcc being\nphased out?\n\nthanks,\nAndrea\n\nOn Dec 12, 2007 2:25 PM, Erik=\r\n Hetzner &lt;erik.hetzner@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hi Paul.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks again for the=\r\n answers to my questions.

I know that we have some investment in the format,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and though=\r\n we can of course move forward it is not clear to me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from looking at =\r\nthe sheets.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There were a number of reasons:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. The XML wasn=\r\n&#39;t well-defined for most modules, so the benefits of\n&gt; &gt; XML were mostly lo=\r\nst. Eg, it would be nice to have\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;FetchDNS&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;accept-non-dns-res=\r\nolves&gt;false&lt;/accept-non-dns-resolves&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;deciderules/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;digest-algori=\r\nthm&gt;SHA1&lt;/digest-algorithm&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;digest-content&gt;true&lt;/digest-content&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nenabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/FetchDNS&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ...so that configuration she=\r\nets could be validated using standard\n&gt; &gt; XML tools. But that would also be=\r\n a huge departure from the existing\n&gt; &gt; order.xml, would require more infra=\r\nstructure, and would make it more\n&gt; &gt; difficult to support third-party modu=\r\nles.\n&gt;\n&gt; While I agree that the order.xml format what a bit funny looking, =\r\nI&#39;ve\n&gt; just spent a bit of time convincing myself that a pretty reasonable\n=\r\n&gt; schema could have been written to validate the order.xml format with\n&gt; re=\r\nlax ng.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. XML&#39;s nesting provides a good visual sense of structure fo=\r\nr the\n&gt; &gt; old order.xml and for the new global sheet, but didn&#39;t work so we=\r\nll\n&gt; &gt; for override sheets, which typically contain only a few settings.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; We&#39;d either have to nest many levels of empty tags to get to the\n&gt; &gt; actu=\r\nal overrides, or have two different XML formats for the global\n&gt; &gt; sheet an=\r\nd override sheets.\n&gt;\n&gt; This makes a lot of sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3. The one-setting-=\r\nper-line format plays well with command-line tools\n&gt; &gt; such as diff.\n&gt;\n&gt; Al=\r\nso makes sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4. The one-setting-per-line format closely resembles =\r\nthe new JMX API\n&gt; &gt; for modifying sheets. In particular, code used for JMX =\r\ntransport of\n&gt; &gt; settings is re-used to read/write the sheet files.\n&gt;\n&gt; Aha=\r\n. This makes even more sense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your detailed answers. If I se=\r\nem reluctant to leave behind\n&gt; the order.xml format, it is not for a partic=\r\nular love of xml or the\n&gt; order.xml format. It is simply that we have infra=\r\nstructure deployed\n&gt; that makes use of order.xml. Additionally, I have been=\r\n developing an\n&gt; HTTP interface for Heritrix which extends the order.xml fo=\r\nrmat to\n&gt; allow creating jobs, retrieving data, etc. from a running Heritri=\r\nx\n&gt; instance using HTTP (rather than JMX), and I am going to have to\n&gt; dete=\r\nrmine how to rework this to work with the new settings format. I\n&gt; had not =\r\nrealized until a few days ago that the new settings had\n&gt; progressed so far=\r\n and that order.xml files were to be left behind.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; [=85]\n&gt; &gt; The secon=\r\nd one is not an empty string; it&#39;s saying &quot;Create a new list\n&gt; &gt; that will =\r\nonly contain String values.&quot; To add an elements to the list\n&gt; &gt; you&#39;d use:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; root:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers:0=3Dstring, audio/*;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; q=3D0.2, audio/basic\n&gt; &gt; root:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-header=\r\ns:1=3Dstring, text/*, text/\n&gt; &gt; html, text/html;level=3D1\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, so a dist=\r\ninction is made between primitives and objects,\n&gt; basically.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since the =\r\norder of the lines matters for maps, can you do something to\n&gt; append to a =\r\nlist? For instance:\n&gt;\n&gt; root:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers:_=3D=\r\nstring, audio/*; q=3D0.2, audio/basic\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a though, since I generally =\r\ndislike hard coding the index of a\n&gt; list.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is the config.txt fi=\r\nle necessary?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It bootstraps the settings system. Since the settings=\r\n system itself\n&gt; &gt; uses a BDB, we needed a place to put the configuration f=\r\nor BDB.\n&gt;\n&gt; Make sense, thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Can one define any settings in it?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No; the contents of config.txt are predefined. The valid properties=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; are all listed in the file; anything not listed is simply ignored.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Ok. Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the difference between &#39;primary, org.archive[.=\r\n..]&#39; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;object, org.archive[...]&#39;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Each class of object can=\r\n have one &quot;primary&quot; object nominated in the\n&gt; &gt; global sheet. If a setting =\r\nuses the &quot;primary&quot; tag then the object\n&gt; &gt; created is registered as the pri=\r\nmary.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Primary objects are automatically selected as the default val=\r\nue for\n&gt; &gt; most module settings. For instance, FetchHTTP has a server-cache=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; setting for specifying the ServerCache to use with FetchHTTP. The\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndefault value for that setting is to use the &quot;primary&quot; ServerCache.\n&gt; &gt; In =\r\nthis way only one ServerCache instance needs to be specified in\n&gt; &gt; the she=\r\net, and all the modules that need it just find it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I had assumed (corre=\r\nctly, I think) that in the past the names of\n&gt; certain objects determined t=\r\nheir primary-ness (for instance, the\n&gt; object named &#39;scope&#39; was the scope u=\r\nsed for the crawl). This seems to\n&gt; make more sense than enforcing a partic=\r\nular name for the settings.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; best,\n&gt; Erik Hetzner\n&gt; ;; Erik Hetzner, C=\r\nalifornia Digital Library\n&gt; ;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n&gt;\n\n"}}
