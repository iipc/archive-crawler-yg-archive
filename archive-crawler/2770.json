For me, destroy removes the instance.  Are you using latest or \nlast release?  Looks like the destroy was added after 1.6.0 release: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1358617&group_id=73833&atid=539102.\n\nGo here for latest: \nhttp://crawltools.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/artifacts/HEAD-heritrix/20060321164451\n\n&gt; What I could not do, is create new instances; if you want, I could\n&gt; write here the differents tests, but they are a lot. I have try with\n&gt; create and only the class name, create and the class name and the\n&gt; instance name, create with all the string, etc. How is the syntax to\n&gt; create one?\n\nSorry for your trouble.\n\nHere is a session I had with a Heritrix creating and destroying \ninstances (Commentary begins with &#39;#&#39;):\n\n% # Set 1.5 jdk.\n%  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.5.0_05/\n% # Start heritrix\n%  ./bin/heritrix\n% # List all MBeans.\n%  /usr/local/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/java -jar bin/cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar \ncontrolRole:letmein localhost:8849\n% # Add a bean named &#39;Heritrix2&#39;.  Do it by naming bean same as the \nHeritrix instance created on heritrix start only give it a different \nname (First instance is named &#39;Heritrix&#39;) and by passing the command \n&#39;create&#39; with an argument of the type of bean to create; in this case \norg.archive.crawler.Heritrix\n% /usr/local/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/java -jar bin/cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar \ncontrolRole:letmein localhost:8849 \norg.archive.crawler:guiport=8080,host=lautreamont,jmxport=8849,name=Heritrix2,type=CrawlService \ncreate=org.archive.crawler.Heritrix\n% # List all beans.  Notice addition of new bean (Can also check in \nlocal-instances.jsp in UI).\n% /usr/local/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/java -jar bin/cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar \ncontrolRole:letmein localhost:8849\n% # Destroy &#39;Heritrix2&#39; instance.\n org.archive.crawler:guiport=8080,host=lautreamont,jmxport=8849,name=Heritrix2,type=CrawlService \ndestroy\n% # List all MBeans. Notice how &#39;Heritrix2&#39; has been removed.\n% /usr/local/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/java -jar bin/cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar \ncontrolRole:letmein localhost:8849\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Talking about HCC, I think that I have not been clear in my last\n&gt; question (I read it again, and it gave rise to a misunderstanding).\n&gt; What I want to know is, if that HCC could be used to control, create\n&gt; and destroy instances of Heritrix that resides in the same JVM, but\n&gt; not in the same JVM as HCC. As an example, if I have HCC installed on\n&gt; host A, controlling a default Heritrix instance in host B, can HCC be\n&gt; used to create another Heritrix instance in the host B, but in the\n&gt; same JVM as the default instance?\nYes.  Thats what its all about.\n\nWhat hcc cannot do is startup Heritrix.  Heritrix must be up and running \nfor the hcc to find it.\n&gt;\n&gt; If that is true, I will give HCC a try, as it could be very useful to\n&gt; us, and highly scalable.\nYes.\n\nBe aware that only clients of hcc that I know of are ourselves (in \narchive-it.org service).  It works but its pretty raw.  We should be \nspending a bunch more time on it in near future because we&#39;ll be using \nit to coordinate a cluster of crawlers.  Meantime, don&#39;t hesitate to \npass over any improvements you might see fit.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks very much,\n&gt;\n&gt; tizo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
