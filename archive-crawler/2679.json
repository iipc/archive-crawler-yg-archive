Both surt and seed files can been mixture of both seeds and SURTs.\n&gt; \n&gt; OK. This is good to know. The documentation, as I remember reading\n&gt; when I was creating my SURTs, didn&#39;t imply this. Overall a lot of\n&gt; knowledge about using SURTs is spread through to many\n&gt; documents/messages/wiki entries. The fact that I have to put a &#39;+&#39; in\n&gt; front of the surts in an external SURTs file is counter-intuitive to\n&gt; me.\n\nI agree. Surts-source-file is counter-intuitive since the file name indicates that the file contains \nsurt prefixes rather than a mixed source of different scope forms (e.g +http://archive.org or \n+archive.org). However, I think that we should keep &#39;+&#39; as an indicator that conversion to surt \nprefixes is applied. We should definitely make this clear in the user manual and UI.\n\nTake care,\ni.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
