Those java tools are quite grand for such task\n&gt; and I managed to write a couple of Perl lines to count\n&gt; file offsets =&gt; I can now read html, images etc. from \n&gt; uncompressed arc files. \n&gt; \n&gt; All well, but one has to be very careful when reading\n&gt; binary data from arcs. Reading one blank or linefeed\n&gt; too much corrupts an image, although does really nothing\n&gt; to html or text file. \n\nIndeed.  A confusing bit is that an ARC block does not have a newline\nafter it, instead there&#39;s a newline before the metadata line.\n\n&gt; Even a program which retrieves data from arcs may\n&gt; add a linefeed to a wrong place. I supppose that \n&gt; the Danish tools are so tested that you\n&gt; can fetch images from arcs and look at them\n\nYes, as mentioned we use it in our internal viewer program (a simple\nproxy-based thing) and the images work fine.  If you want just the data,\nyou&#39;ll have to strip off the HTTP headers, of course, and avoid smashing\nthe binary data in that process.  We haven&#39;t assumed in these tools that\nthe data come from HTTP requests, so there&#39;s no functionality in there\nto do that stripping.\n\nI&#39;m glad you&#39;re finding the tools useful.\n\n-Lars\n\n\n"}}
