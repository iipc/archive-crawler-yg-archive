I want to use Heritrix embedded in my applica=\r\ntion. \n2. I just want text and HTML content.\n3. I will use the crawled data=\r\n for text mining purpose and not for\ndisplaying results or do any search on=\r\n it. \n4. For #3 reason I wish to clean the content coming in pages as much\n=\r\nas possible (read NO HTML/Style/Java Script tags present).\n5. Finally I wis=\r\nh to write files on disk in a custom format which goes\nlike this: \n\n&lt;articl=\r\ne&gt;\n&lt;url&gt;www.example.org&lt;/url&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;example.org rocks&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;content&gt;\nbl=\r\nah blah blah I removed all tags yay.\n&lt;/content&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\nHere each artic=\r\nle would be a page of the source I am crawling. So my\nquestion is do I need=\r\n my custom writer for this purpose? I read in the\ngroup and discovered that=\r\n the parsing of content can be costly affair\nif done while crawling. But if=\r\n I download all the content and then\nstart converting into custom format I =\r\nfear I will need more work in\nreading the content in meaningful manner and =\r\nsorting out articles.\nAlso can some one comment on the XML write that Herit=\r\nrix comes with,\nwhat is the purpose? Any other inputs will be deeply apprec=\r\niated. I am\nstill in design stage so I can replan the whole thing if some o=\r\nne\ncomes with a great idea.\n\n\n"}}
