which we want ignored.\n\nwe would also like to consider including FindBugs in our\ncontinuous integration (auto-build) process, so i&#39;ve opened an\nissue for that as well:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1757\n\nthis may be further off, as we plan to consolidate auto-builds\nfor H1 (CruiseControl) and H3 (Continuum) into a single system.\n\ni really like the FindBugs Eclipse plugin, but don&#39;t see a way\nto get &quot;-emacs&quot;-like output from it, and it doesn&#39;t look like\nannotations (in the Bug User Annotations view) can be uploaded\nto the cloud from the plugin.\n\nwhen i open the Web Start client, it says &quot;not signed in&quot;, but\nthe Comunity Review page says a seperate browser window will\nopen to login with OpenId. is there another way to login to the\nreview?\n\nwhich version of Heritrix was analyzed to produce the bugs in\nthe FindBugs Cloud? is there a way to see the options that were\nused to produce the cloud report for a particular project?\n\nit would be nice to reconcile the cloud bugs with the bugs i\nfind with a local client, so we can track them together.\notherwise, i&#39;ll need to open a seperate issue simply to provide\nfeedback to the cloud for Community Review. do you have another\nrecommendation?\n\n\n/steve@...\n\n\nOn 4/13/10 11:49 AM, Nat Ayewah wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am a PhD student working with the FindBugs project, at the University\n&gt; of Maryland. FindBugs &lt;http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/&gt; is a popular\n&gt; open source static analysis tool that can analyze Java software and\n&gt; identify bugs. We recently analyzed *Heritrix*, and identified about 42\n&gt; warnings that might be of interest to the project. You can launch an\n&gt; instance of FindBugs and evaluate each warning using this link (requires\n&gt; Java): http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/cloud/heritrix.jnlp (You may also\n&gt; comment on any warning by signing into a Google, Yahoo or OpenID account)\n&gt;\n&gt; FindBugs has recently started a community review of several open source\n&gt; projects. This is similar to a recently completed review\n&gt; &lt;http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/&gt; at Google in which almost 300\n&gt; engineers reviewed thousands of issues, fixing many of them. I would\n&gt; like to invite you all to participate in the review for Heritrix, and\n&gt; other open source projects. During the review, you are able to comment\n&gt; on each warning and evaluate it as &quot;Must Fix&quot;, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, &quot;Not a\n&gt; Bug&quot; and other classifications. We are particularly interested in\n&gt; learning if any warnings are causing problems in production.\n&gt;\n&gt; The list of projects currently included in our review is at\n&gt; http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/cloud/\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance for your consideration.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Nat Ayewah\n&gt; PhD candidate, University of Maryland\n&gt; http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ayewah\n&gt; ayewah@...\n\n"}}
