However, the web console should show less \nmemory used when a job has ended and you&#39;ve clicked the &#39;teardown&#39; \nbutton (which discards all built-crawl structures).\n\nSo depending on what tool you&#39;re using to get the memory-usage readings, \nthere may not be anything wrong with what you&#39;re seeing.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
