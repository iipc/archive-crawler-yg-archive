I&#39;m doing a research in a metric to =\r\nestimate the numbers\n&gt; &gt; of URL of a domain. I have a problem to solve and =\r\nyou think you can help me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  I want to make a complete graph of all =\r\nURL&#39;s collected but all I have from\n&gt; &gt; crawl.log is the &quot;father&quot; of the UR=\r\nL and the URL. This would be necessary but\n&gt; &gt; I have an misundertanding ab=\r\nout one thing: If heritrix collect one URL,\n&gt; &gt; suppose &quot;yahoo.com&quot; from &quot;g=\r\noogle.com&quot;. If the heritrix enter in &quot;amazon.com&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and found &quot;yahoo.com&quot;=\r\n again, in crawl.log will appear:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  - - - yahoo.com - google.com\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  - - - yahoo.com - amazon.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  or only:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  - - - yahoo.com -=\r\n google.com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  So, the heritrix will ignore the found in &quot;amazon.com&quot;=\r\n because it was already\n&gt; &gt; found in &quot;google.com&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Att.\n&gt; &gt;  Elver=\r\nton.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =3D&gt; Gordon&#39;s answer:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You&#39;re correct, the crawl.log is not e=\r\nnough info to make a full web\n&gt; &gt; graph... it only records the exact paths =\r\nthat led to a URI being first\n&gt; &gt; discovered. You&#39;d need to log more from t=\r\nhe crawler before it &#39;uniques&#39;\n&gt; &gt; the URIs for crawling purposes, or perfo=\r\nrm a post-crawl analysis on the\n&gt; &gt; full link-containing content, to create=\r\n the web graph.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Gordon\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
