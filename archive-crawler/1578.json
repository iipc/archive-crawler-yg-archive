It works fine with Windows XP\n&gt; (with/without Service Pack 1) but NOT with Service\n&gt; Pack 2. We tried it with two different computers with\n&gt; SP 2 installed and got the same result in both cases.\n&gt; Now my question is: Has anybody been able to use a\n&gt; version of Heritrix successfully with Windows XP\n&gt; Service Pack 2?\n\nCan you figure how SP2 is changing the environment for Heritrix?  Are\nservices that Heritrix expects removed/shutdown by the SP2 install\n(DNS, java, classpath).  Does the output from Heritrix give you clues\nas to whats missing/changed?\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Christoph\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
