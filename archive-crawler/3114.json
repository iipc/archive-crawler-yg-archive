This\n&gt; better suits my needs, but perhaps others would prefer it together?\n&gt; Also I added a TLD distribution.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would appreciate any feedback you all might have.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks great Frank.

Send over a \npatch so we can take a look at whats involved integrating. \n\nOtherwise:\n\n+ Separating DNS from HTTP seems like it would make for easier reading.  \nHTTPS is mixed in with HTTP I assume?\n+ In crawl_report1.html, the &#39;Status code&#39;, &#39;MIME type&#39;, and &#39;Hosts&#39; \ncolumn members are clickable and take me to what looks like a page that \nwill draw out a grep of log content?  Is that right?\n+ In &#39;seeds_report.html&#39;, the &#39;Status code and Disposition&#39; column has \nthe description text as links taking me to the grep-of-logs page. Is \nthat what you intended?  (I like the feature where you mix in the \nredirect page as a link so can take a quick look at where the crawler \nwas directed).\n\nGood stuff,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
