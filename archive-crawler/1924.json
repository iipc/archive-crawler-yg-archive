At some point we&#39;d\nwant to be able to add domain-specific settings (filters, etc), but\nfor now simply being able to set the name, etc. would be a good start.\n In other words I want to be able to call something like\ncreateNewCrawl(templateName, newCrawlName, newCrawlAudience, newCrawlDir)\n\nI haven&#39;t been able to figure out how to do it though.  The xsd is\npretty generic, not laying out the elements and attributes by\nname/type.  I had hoped to use xbeans to create a wrapper around the\nxsd, but with the the xsd provided it doesn&#39;t seem to allow me to do\nwhat I need.  I tried looking at how the wui does it, but it&#39;s all\nwithin the context of a running heritrix instance.\n\nAm I missing something obvious, looking in the wrong place?  Any\nideas, pointers?\n\nThanks,\nRob Eger\nLocal Matters, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
