(hopefully then the os would \nknow that you are serious about wanting a file)  then try to create another \nfile assuming that the first file is a directory....   I *think* that is \nsimilar to what I had done with java 1.4 and it failed reliably.  but I \nlost what I had done when I update my local copy from head and switched to \njava 1.5.  I created the disktest stuff in /tmp assuming it would be OK to \nleave any left over wreckage from the test there.  I get nervous about \ncreating crud in either /proc or /dev.\n\nhmmm.  just wondered if a way to get the failure would be to create a \ndirectory and then treat the directory as if it were a file to get the \nerror....  I guess I should go look at the code.  but this is not the most \nimportant bug on my list today.  Somehow I doubt that it is high on \nanyone&#39;s list.\n\nI&#39;d be happy to try anything on fedora that needs to be tried, but I hate \nto waste time on it if anyone else is  chasing it.  If I were to update the \njava engine on them, I could test a number of different linux environments.\n\nAt 06:17 PM 1/21/2005, you wrote:\n\n&gt;Dave Skinner wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I am runnning with Sun&#39;s JRE build 1.4.1_02-b06, but I doubt that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;matters.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I could not  make heritrix with 1.4.1_02b06 work under fedora core3.  I\n&gt; &gt; upgraded to (sun) jdk1.5.0_01 and it works\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I also had the disk test fail and made a bug report about it.  the\n&gt; &gt; test is\n&gt; &gt; creating a file in /dev while making an assumption that it wont be\n&gt; &gt; able to\n&gt; &gt; create it.  I patched it while using 1.4 but when I upgraded to 1.5 it\n&gt; &gt; failed (to fail) again in a slightly different way.  someone is going to\n&gt; &gt; have to figure out a way that it consistently fails in different\n&gt; &gt; environments.\n&gt;\n&gt;Dave:\n&gt;\n&gt;First, thanks for the bug reports related to filters.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;ve commented out the test till we figure a universally uncreateable\n&gt;file name (I thought we could change the directory for the uncreateable\n&gt;file from &#39;/dev&#39; to &#39;/proc&#39; which&#39;d work for linux but not necessarily\n&gt;on other OSs).\n&gt;\n&gt;St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Yahoo!
