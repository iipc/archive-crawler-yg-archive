First of all, the page noted to be Tom Emerson&#39;s\nsolution (http://www.dreamersrealm.net/tree/blog/) doesn&#39;t seem to\nwork any more. Do you have a copy of that page?\n  You also mentioned to add some filters in HTTP-Fetcher and ARCWriter\nprocessors. How can I read the http header and/or the content in the\nARCWriterProcessor?\n  In this section of the FAQ you refer to the site\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manaul.html#midfetch .\nI would replace the string &#39;manaul&#39; to &#39;manual&#39; :)\nBye:\nTamas\n\n"}}
