I can&#39;t figure out a way to do this.  It&#39;s\n&gt; possible to filter on content type, but I want an arcWriter filter\n&gt; that looks at the body, say by runing a regex match over the text.\n&gt;\nThere is no such filter in Heritrix currently.  You&#39;ll have to write \none.  Do it as a standalone filter or as a DecideRule to include in a \nDecidingFilter.  See developer manual for notes on how to write your own \nfilter.  Study the ARCWriterProcessor for how to get an inputstream on \nto the downloaded content or see ExtractorHTML for an example of running \nregexes across the downloaded content.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; Is it possible to do this?\n&gt;\n&gt;   Thankx,\n&gt;   Lou\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; YAHOO!
