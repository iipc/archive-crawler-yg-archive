Our current theory is that it&#39;s a JVM GC\nissue; at least one crash output log showed a &quot;GCTaskThread&quot;\nas the culprit.\n\nUsing the &quot;-XX:+UseSerialGC&quot; to force the use of the classic\ngarbage collector (which is still the default on uniprocessor\nand &lt;2GB RAM machines) has, so far, cleared our crashes up.\n\nOne other gotcha I *think* I&#39;ve seen with the Sun 1.5.0_03\n64bit JVM: using the nifty new &#39;jmap&#39; and &#39;jstack&#39; utilities\nseems to be correlated with JVM lockups, where threads\nwind up waiting for wake signals that never arrive. In some\nsuch lockups, even a &#39;kill -9&#39; won&#39;t exit the JVM -- only\nconnecting to the process with &#39;gdb&#39; and issuing its internal\n&#39;kill&#39; command works.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nMatt Ittigson wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;m having a problem (this time I&#39;m sure its actually with Heritrix)\n&gt; with hard crashes.  I have the hs_err_pidXXX.logs and the\n&gt; heritrix_out.log, but neither points me clearly toward the problem. \n&gt; I&#39;m running Heritrix-200505310807 (though I&#39;ve had crashes with\n&gt; previous versions, including 1.4, as well) on a dual Opteron, with 2G\n&gt; of ram, running Linux 2.6.9, glibc 2.3.4, JVM 1.5.0_03.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is there some logging I could turn on (or perhaps somewhere I could\n&gt; look) which could point me toward the right direction?  I&#39;m guessing\n&gt; it has to do with a certain URL getting hit, which causes the crash,\n&gt; so if I could narrow down what exactly Heritrix is up to right before,\n&gt; maybe I could figure out how to skip the particular URL&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; A little more information:  In the past, the crashes have mostly been\n&gt; consistent.  My previous usage model was to break large seed files\n&gt; into smaller chunks, and Heritrix would usually crash consistently on\n&gt; the chunks with problems.  Sometimes, re-running a seed chunk which\n&gt; would cause a crash could run to competion without crashing (becase I\n&gt; retire host-based queues at 200 URL&#39;s, this could be due to the bad\n&gt; URL being occasionally skipped for being out of scope), but most of\n&gt; the time the crash would be consistent.  I&#39;m now continually loading\n&gt; seeds via cmdline-jmx.  I&#39;ve changed my program to output exactly at\n&gt; what point the crash happens (when the connection is refused), but\n&gt; that won&#39;t really make clear exactly which URL&#39;s are being crawled at\n&gt; the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Are there known bugs that would cause hard crashes I could look into? \n&gt; Would posting the log files to this list help debug the problem?  Is\n&gt; there logging I could turn on to show exactly what was being crawled\n&gt; at the time of the crash?  Any other ideas of approaches to take\n&gt; toward solving the problem?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks.\n&gt; \n&gt; -matt\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
