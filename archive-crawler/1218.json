If the answer is YES everything is solved and I don&#39;t\n&gt; need answers on the other questions. If the answer is NO (which is\n&gt; probably the case) then...\n&gt;\n&gt; Second questions: Do you know any open source utility that can convert\n&gt; the ARC file into proper HTML? Or even many utilities that can be used\n&gt; together to achieve this? Or to I need to parse the document myself\n&gt; using regExps to discard everything ARC-specific from it and thus take\n&gt; as output an almost-proper HTML?\n&gt;\n&gt; Third Question: Are there any open source utilities that can parse ARC\n&gt; files and extract specific stuff from them, such as links, titles of\n&gt; documents etc?\n&gt;\n&gt; Note: I&#39;m talking about ARCs that have only text/html in them. My ARCs\n&gt; are clean of any binary stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; I apologize in advance if I am off topic. Please forgive.\n&gt; I thank you any advance for every useful (or not useful) answers or\n&gt; points to any documentation or utilities on those matters...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
