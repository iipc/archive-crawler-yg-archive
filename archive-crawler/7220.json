The way to solve it, using Heritrix =\r\n1.x, is to create an override for the domain (e.g. domain.com) and override=\r\n the &#39;force-queue-assignment&#39; setting on the &#39;frontier&#39;. This will cause th=\r\nis domain and all of its subdomains to be added to the same politeness queu=\r\ne (instead of each subdomain getting its own). Typically I use the domain n=\r\name (e.g. domain.com) as the override value.\n\nYou might also loosen the pol=\r\niteness settings a bit on this override if you deem that the site can handl=\r\ne it, now that there will only be one hit at a time.\n\nIn Heritrix 3.x, this=\r\n is a bit different. Per domain overrides have been replaced with a differe=\r\nnt mechanism and you&#39;ll have to create a separate &#39;sheet overlay&#39; for each =\r\nof these domains and apply the corresponding configuration change (see queu=\r\neAssignmentPolicy in the cxml).\n\nTo make things easier for myself, I create=\r\nd a variant on the SurtAuthorityQueueAssignmentPolicy that allows me to spe=\r\ncify a maximum number of domain levels to include in the queue name. Using =\r\nthis I only have to have one single sheet overlay and map all the problem d=\r\nomains to this overlay. This makes for a much cleaner cxml if you have many=\r\n such problem domains.\n\n- Kris\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ia=\r\nn Hummel&quot; &lt;ian@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi folks,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m new to Heritrix, and am h=\r\naving difficulty crawling a particular site &quot;politely&quot;.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Basically th=\r\ne site itself contains hundreds of subdomains such as foo.domain.com, bar.d=\r\nomain.com, baz.domain.com etc... the problem is that all of these domains p=\r\noint to the same physical host in reality and the politeness controls such =\r\nas min-delay-ms treat each of these as unique hosts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any thoughts on t=\r\nhe best way to address this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Ian.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
