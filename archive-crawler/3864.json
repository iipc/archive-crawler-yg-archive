I need Heritrix to\nmake an RPC=\r\n call, passing the HTML contents to the RPC server, and\nbased upon the resp=\r\nonse, extracting the URI&#39;s or not.  \n\nSo perhaps what I need is a custom ex=\r\ntractor, that inherits from any\nof the other extractor types, but makes an =\r\nRPC call before actually\ndoing an extraction.  If the RPC comes back true, =\r\nthen do the\nextraction, if not then return null.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?  I=\r\n simply want to decide if I want to use the\nextracted URI&#39;s based on the co=\r\nntent of the HTML.\n\nThanks,\nKaleb\n\n\n\n"}}
