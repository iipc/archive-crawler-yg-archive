By trial and error I\nhave found that jboss-jmx.jar causes the problem. After removing this\nJAR Heritrix works fine. Further testing revealed that this problem\nstill exists in 3.2.7 but is gone in 4.0.1 (at least I tested on those\ntwo). ...why that error happens, I don&#39;t know since I have not looked\nat the source of that JAR. \n\nBye,\nHolger\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stackarchiveorg&quot; &lt;stack@a...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Holger Stenzhorn&quot; &lt;holger@x&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have embedded Heritrix into an information sytsem I wrote and there\n&gt; &gt; I call its API directly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Until recently I have used Heritrix 1.2 under JDK 1.4. Now I have\n&gt; &gt; updated to Heritrix 1.4 (with JDK 1.4) and get the following error\n&gt; &gt; message: &quot;name is not a valid java type (or is a reserved word):\n&gt; &gt; settings-directory&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I use JDK 1.5 everything works fine - but for a costumer I need to\n&gt; &gt; use JDK 1.4.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I took a look at the MANIFEST in the JAR file of Heritrix I saw\n&gt; &gt; that it was compiled with JDK 1.5. So I rebuild Heritrix from the\n&gt; &gt; sources with JDK 1.4.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But still the above described error happens as before.\n&gt; \n&gt; You get this message trying to compile the application that integrates\n&gt; Heritrix? Are you setting the javac &#39;-target&#39; to be 1.4? See here for\n&gt; discussion of &#39;-target&#39; on javac:\n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javac.html\n&gt; (Search for &#39;target&#39;).  If your build system is ant, see the\n&gt; discussion under the &#39;target&#39; task on this page:\n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javac.html (Again\n&gt; search for target).\n&gt; \n&gt; The Heritrix jar itself should need no modification to run in a 1.4\n&gt; JVM.  That&#39;s our own target JVM version.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
