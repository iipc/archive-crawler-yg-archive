Additionally, since these fields are\nstatic there can be no alternate configuration implementations.\n\nI&#39;ll work on a patch that illustrates this.  It will be a simple\nrefactoring of Heretrix.java, and you can commit it if you like.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Joshua Davis wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I&#39;m trying to use Heretrix embedded in another Java program rather\n&gt; &gt;than from the command line and I&#39;m finding it difficult to get\n&gt; &gt;Heretrix to initialize.   Looking at the source code, I see a lot\nof\n&gt; &gt;static fields in Heretrix.java that need to be initialized in ways\n&gt; &gt;that are only accessible from the outside from the main() method.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I think Heretrix would be more flexible if these static\nconfiguration\n&gt; &gt;parameters were in a single instance, or better yet, behind an\n&gt; &gt;interface that outsiders (like myself) could implement.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Just an idea.  What do you think?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; We could do that.  Or perhaps it&#39;d be better if they could be \n&gt; initialized from a properties file or system properties.  Tell us\nmore \n&gt; where you&#39;re having problems (or send a patch that illlustrates\nwhat \n&gt; you&#39;d like changed).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the feedback,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
