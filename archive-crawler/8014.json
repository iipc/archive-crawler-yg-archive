But why Heritrix reports this error? Is there any configuration that I did wrong?\n\nCrawling sometimes overwhelms (or hits throttling limits) of DNS \nservices... that&#39;s what I&#39;d look at first.\n\nThere could be more hints in the crawl.log or ARC/WARC records - \nespecially if you compare the failures to other successes nearby in \ntime. (Do the failures happen in batches then resolve? Do the records \nconfirm that the crawler is asking the DNS server you think that it is?)\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
