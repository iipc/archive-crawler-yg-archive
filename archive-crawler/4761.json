If there are answers posted somewhere (i.e. a Wiki) please\n&gt; direct me there, but the Wiki on the Heritrix website didn&#39;t seem to\n&gt; provide the answers I&#39;m looking for.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) How can you control the page request speed of Heritrix. I performed\n&gt; one crawl that was requesting HTML pages from a server at 1.1 page per\n&gt; second. Which I think is to heavy a load on a web server.\n\nLook in the settings for anything with &#39;delay&#39; in it. Our default \nprofiles include a minimum 2000ms delay before releasing another URI \nfrom the same host-based queue -- but if many hostnames are served from \nthe same IP you could see faster visits in practice.\n\n&gt; 2) I see in the finished crawler report stats on images (JPG, GIF,\n&gt; etc. etc). Is Heritrix downloading images while it&#39;s crawling, and if\n&gt; so how do I disable that.\n\nYes, the crawler archives all file types by default. See this FAQ (and \nalso search the list) for ideas on limiting the crawler to text only:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/faq.html#midfetch\n\n(That technique will need some slight updating to work in latest \nDecideRule-rather-than-Filter-based releases -- you can also search the \nlist archives for relevant discussion.\n\nGiven how common this need is, I really wish it were easier. However, \nthe Internet Archive and its primary partners never crawl this way -- we \nalways want images -- so any change here is more likely to come from an \noutside contribution.\n\n&gt; 3) I&#39;m interested in archiving HTML that links to text files of the\n&gt; extension &quot;.ms&quot;. How can I generate a report of HTML pages that\n&gt; contain those links? I also want to archive those .MS files.\n\nYou could postprocess the ARCs to find such pages. Or write your own \nProcessor that checks for such links and affects followup crawling -- \nfor example something that would go after Extractors and discard \npages/links not of interest before they are written or their outbound \nlinks rescheduled with the Frontier.\n\n&gt; 4) Does anyone have Heritrix running on a network with multiple\n&gt; machines working on the same crawl job. Is this even possible?\n\nYes, crudely with manual splitting of the URI space. We&#39;ve split jobs \nover as many as 6 machines at IA; we&#39;ve heard of others splitting over \nas many as 8. Search the list archives for [&quot;distributed crawler&quot;] for \nsome discussion & tips.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
