I have a seeds fil=\r\ne with 100K URLs but I do not know how to provide it as input.\n\n2- Here is =\r\nthe scenarion I want to use Heritrix for and I would like to know if my ass=\r\numptions are correct. I want to gather a data set consisting of webpages th=\r\nat have:\n      a- HTML forms\n      b-  Javascript processing forms data.\nTh=\r\nen I will go offline and iterate over the ARC archive files that result fro=\r\nm my crawl using a java program. While iterating, I can check each one of t=\r\nhe files if it is of type html/text and if so check if it contains an html =\r\nform. If it does and the code that processes the form is in a separate java=\r\nscript file is there a way to extract that file from the archives using for=\r\n example its URL as an index or do I have to download that file again?\n\n3- =\r\nIs there a good reference with some example profiles with values for the di=\r\nfferent configurations available along with description of when to use each=\r\n of these profiles (I mean based on the bandwidth available to my machine a=\r\nnd its processing power I can use these reference examples to better decide=\r\n different inputs). \n\nThanks for your help\n\n\n"}}
