Many HTTP\n&gt;  &gt; client utilities have an SSL option.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; We considered, but ultimately did not include in H3, a command-line\n&gt;  &gt; switch to listen for plain HTTP rather than HTTPS.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; You could use some combination of other netcat/openssl programs to set\n&gt;  &gt; up a proxy that accepts normal HTTP and forwards to HTTPS. For example,\n&gt;  &gt; using the &#39;ncat&#39; program that&#39;s part of &#39;nmap&#39;, this one-liner on the\n&gt;  &gt; same machine as the crawler sets up such a proxy on port 8008:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; % ncat -l 8008 -c &quot;ncat --ssl localhost 8443&quot;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Be sure to review and understand the &#39;Security Considerations&#39; of the\n&gt;  &gt; Heritrix administrative interface:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Security+Considerations &lt;https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Security+Considerations&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Note especially that if your crawler operator credentials are\n&gt;  &gt; compromised by any mechanism (observed in transit over unencrypted link;\n&gt;  &gt; failure to verify that SSL connect was with intended server-certificate;\n&gt;  &gt; choice of weak login/password; etc.), then resulting unauthorized access\n&gt;  &gt; to the crawler interface allows an attacker to change files, and run\n&gt;  &gt; arbitrary code, on the crawler machine with the privileges of the user\n&gt;  &gt; account used to the launch the Java VM.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; That&#39;s why we recommend:\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; - pick strong credentials\n&gt;  &gt; - only connect via HTTPS, and verify the expected server certificate\n&gt;  &gt; - use additional redundant mechanisms (listening only for local\n&gt;  &gt; connections; firewall policies) to prevent connections from unexpected\n&gt;  &gt; places\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n-- \n/steve@...\n\n"}}
