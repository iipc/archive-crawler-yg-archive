I let it run for a few mins and then paused it.  Went to\n&gt; the View/Edit Frontier page and added a URI from a file, and was\n&gt; informed 1 URI was added from it.  Then I resumed the crawl.  Couldn&#39;t\n&gt; see anywhere that the new URI was getting crawled, queued, or\nanything.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Am I doing this incorrectly, or is the functionality not there yet?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rob Eger\n&gt; Aptas, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
