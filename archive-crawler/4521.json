That said, a CMD script has been added to\n        $HERITRIX_HOME/bin lately that does most of what the\n        $HERITRIX_HOME/bin/heritrix does loading jars in the right\n        order, etc. (Originally contributed by Eric Jensen and finished\n        by Max Sch√∂fmann). Max has also written up this page: Web\n        crawling: Using Heritrix on Windows. Also see Crawler Stalling\n        on Windows, 2085 and the items below that pertain to windows:\n        dns and mkdir.\n        \nYou should probably look to heritrix.cmd for guidance on classpath\nissues & jar loading order.\n\nOr, install Linux :-)\n\nTed\n\nOn Fri, 2007-08-24 at 13:28 -0400, mikej wrote:\n&gt; Any help with the below issue would be greatly appreciated!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 8/23/07, mikej &lt;bosoxchamps@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;         Thanks for the help so far, but I am hitting the following\n&gt;         issue:\n&gt;         \n&gt;         First - I confirmed that the lib jar files are visible by\n&gt;         checking the following:\n&gt;         Right click on project --&gt; select Properties --&gt; highligh\n&gt;         &#39;Java Build Path&#39; --&gt; Select &#39;Libraries&#39; tab.
