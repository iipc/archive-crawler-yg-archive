If after a long time some seeds are showing up as NOTCRAWLED in the seed report, it could be that the sites have not been responding and that the seeds are on the slow retry cycle. Some additional analysis of config/reports/logs could reveal what&#39;s going on. How many seeds do you have, how many have not been crawled, what is being crawled instead, how busy is the crawl, any unusual config, and so forth. The particular thing you&#39;re asking about, crawling remaining seeds immediately ahead of anything else, may be possible but probably not trivial, and the way to do it (and whether it makes sense to try) depends on knowing more about the state of the crawl.\n\nNoah\n\nOn 2012-01-13 12:35 , Jian wrote:\n&gt; I am crawling a list of seed urls with a depth of 5. However, the seed report file has not been changed for five days. Although the size of the crawled document is increasing, the number of seed urls that are not crawled does not decrease. I suspect the crawler might be &quot;trapped&quot; into a website so I want the crawler to stop crawling the current seed urls and simply start crawling the remaining seed URLs. How can I do that? I am using H3.1.0. Thanks. -John\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
