We&#39;ll \nthen run it through our test cycle which comprises generally of a week \nof test crawls followed by a week of production crawls (A rough Test \nPlan can be found here: \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CrawlTestPlan).  1.2 will \nhave the priority 8 and above features from the RFE list which can be \nfound here: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539102.  It will \nalso have bugs that are priority 8 and above fixed from the bugs list \nwhich can be found here: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73833&atid=539099.\n\nComments?\n\nThanks,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n"}}
