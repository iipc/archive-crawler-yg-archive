From the release notes I understand it handles updation of mirrors by default. No need to change configuration like the 1.x.x release.\n\nThat&#39;s not accurate. What part of the release notes gave you that \nimpression? We&#39;ll correct it.\n\nThe MirrorWriter is a contributed component; we don&#39;t use or maintain it \nat the Internet Archive.\n\nThe duplication-reduction features of Heritrix allow followup crawls to \nskip fetching or storing unchanged material, but they require added \nnon-default configuration, in Heritrix 1.x and Heritrix 3.x.\n\n&gt; I have mirrored a website by specifying its URL in a seeds.txt.\n&gt;\n&gt; First time it downloaded the entire website.\n&gt;\n&gt; But when I try to launch the job again it only checks for the main URL. If it is not modified it says &quot;Finished&quot; then and there without checking for the remaining URL&#39;s which have been mirrored previously.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this the desired behaviour of updation or is there any configuration which should be used so that Heritrix checks for all the links which have been previously downloaded for modification.\n\nIf you have the most aggressive duplication-reduction settings (sending \n&quot;If-Modified&quot;/&quot;If-None-Match&quot; headers and respecting not-changed \nresponses from servers), and Heritrix is able to skip fetching an \nunchanged page entirely, it won&#39;t even have the outlinks to continue the \ncurrent crawl. (We don&#39;t carry the discovered links forward in the URI \nhistory info.)\n\nSo, if you want use those settings, it&#39;s up to you to feed the crawler \nthose URIs from the earlier crawl(s) you want it to re-check.\n\nIf you turn off the send-if-modified/send-if-none-match settings, the \ncrawler will always fetch content, and use only content-checksums to \ndetect if a page has changed. The (same old) links are discovered and \nrecrawled, and then it is up to the writer-module to skip writing the \nunchanged content.\n\nCarrying forward a history of the outlinks discovered on previous visits \nis under consideration for a future release.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Any help would be appreciated!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Sriram.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
