But I h=\r\nave two limitations:\n1 - I can not pause jobs and then resume it with\ncmdli=\r\nne-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar (that I used to pause the job in hours of\npeak traf=\r\nfic and resume the job after)\n2 - Not only would like to pause the jobs but=\r\n will also begin where\nthey stayed, using cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar in a=\r\n automatically and\nplanned time.\nThese two requirements are essential for m=\r\naking crawler automatically\nwith the HERITRIX, and to automate the use of H=\r\nERITRIX running on\nseveral machines when is used in a distributed manner us=\r\ning HERITRIX\nCluster Controller.\nIt is not difficult add the functionality =\r\n1 and 2 in the\ncmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar but I didn&#39;t found on the site =\r\nof\nHERITRIX the source code of it. While steps 1 and 2 can be automated \nby=\r\n making a post request to WUI (here are also needed to send the\ncredentials=\r\n in the post-petition), is more comfortable do that with\nthe cmdline-jmxcli=\r\nent.\nI have running Heritrix-1.12.1 in Windows 2003 Server.\nThanks\n\n\n"}}
