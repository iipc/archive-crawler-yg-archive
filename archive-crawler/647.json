IMHO,\n&gt; leaving the compression to the underlying layers would lessen the risk\n&gt; of the file itself becoming unreadable.  Hardware compression stays with\n&gt; the hardware, in-format compression can (and does) confuse people.  \n\nShort answer: I haven&#39;t compared with hardware compression.\n\nBut:\n\nThe Flate algorithm (used by GZIP) does really well on text,\nespecially text with lots of redundancies. The algorithm is well\ndefined (RFCs 1950 and 1951) and widely accepted. Implementations\nexist for pretty much every current platform, and will continue to be\ncreated, I expect.\n\nHardware compression&#39;s problem, IMHO, is the fact that the compression\nlives on the hardware. If you move the file to a different disk or\nbackup to tape or DVD-R or whatever you loose the compression, and\nwill probably end up having to recompress the ARC files anyway.\n\nHandling GZIP appears to be complicated by Java, not by the algorithms\nthemselves: the JNI bindings to the libz library make the low-level\nmanipulation of the GZIP streams difficult. Doing this from C++ was\nmuch easier.\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
