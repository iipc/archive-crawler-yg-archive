I have a couple =\r\nof question about Heritrix&#39; handling of HTML forms which I have been unable=\r\n to answer through the manuals or Javadocs. (I haven&#39;t looked at the code..=\r\n yet)  I&#39;m using version 1.4.0.\n\nI assume from the behaviour I see that Her=\r\nitrix will attempt to crawl &quot;through&quot; HTML forms. I assume it does this in =\r\nextractorHTML class, and simply &quot;submits&quot; the forms without supplying any v=\r\nalues.  Can anyone confirm (or deny) this? \n\nIt appears (in my case) that i=\r\nt does this even when the form has the attribute\n\n   method=3D&quot;post&quot;\n\nindic=\r\nating an HTTP POST instead of an HTTP GET. Again, Can anyone confirm or den=\r\ny?\n\n\nIn practice, the problem I am seeing is really the fault of the Web si=\r\nte: it uses a relative URL as the &quot;action&quot; for the form, and re-uses the sa=\r\nme form on several different pages, thus generating a range of invalid URLs=\r\n, but the nature of the site is to quietly accept these bad URLs... what a =\r\nmess.  Here&#39;s an example URL if anyone is interested:\n\n  http://blog.greens=\r\n.org.nz/index.php/2005/06/28/\n\nthe &quot;Subscribe&quot; button mid-way down the righ=\r\nt-hand column effectively takes you back to the homepage with a mangled, bu=\r\nt valid, URL.\n\n\nHowever, I&#39;m curious (and a little concerned) about the HTM=\r\nL form behaviour noted above. Any advice on these issues would be appreciat=\r\ned.\n\nThanks,\nGordon\n\n\n\n"}}
