There is one that has a host name\nwhich is capitalized, and which gets rewritten to lowercase.\n\nMost confusing is the difference between the seed report and the\ncrawl.log --- where did the 23 URLs go?\n\nI understand that the redirects get added to the seed list, and this\naccounts for the 304, mostly. (Actually I can account for 303 this\nway.)\n\nPerhaps I shouldn&#39;t care about this, but the project I&#39;m working on\nrequires me to give detailed reports about the final disposition of\neach seed URL, and these different numbers are confusing me. Can\nsomeone elucidate on the different ways these values might differ? I\nassume there is some method for tracing the handling of each and every\nseed?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n    -tree\n\n-- \nTom Emerson                                          Basis Technology Corp.\nSoftware Architect                                 http://www.basistech.com\n  &quot;Beware the lollipop of mediocrity: lick it once and you suck forever&quot;\n\n"}}
