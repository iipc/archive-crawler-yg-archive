If my seed urls contain an URL corresponding to\nsuch a document, I noticed a strange behavior:\n\nshouldProcess() and innerProcess(), for my URL, seems to be called 3\ntimes for the same URL (the seed). On the first two attempts, the\ncontent associated to the ProcessorURI is empty. I guess what&#39;s\nhappening is that Heritrix tries to retrieve the URL, but has to make\nthe dns: request first and then fetch the example.com/robots.txt file\nbefore it actually retrieves the first document (corresponding to the\nseed).\n\nWhat I dont understand however, is why innerProcess and shouldProcess\nare called three times... It should call these only once when\neverything is ready, or at least that&#39;s what seems logical. Reading\nthe (old) heritrix 1.15 documentation did not help me, can someone\nshed some light on this or point me to some code fragments that would\nhelp me understand what&#39;s happening?\n\nThanks\n\nJean-Noel\n\nPS: and I know it must be a very common question, but when\ndocumentation on heritrix 2 is expected?\n\n"}}
