We \nwould like to capture as many high quality pages as possible.\n\nWe would also like to have a blacklist of unwanted sites.  This \nblacklist would possibly contain millions hosts.  Do you have any \nexperience in the resources needed for this?  Would this slow down the \nspeed of the crawl?\n\nIn our small crawls that we have been running, we found that although we \nhave setup for a breadth first crawl, days into the crawl and 10&#39;s of \nmillion of pages crawled, the crawler has still only crawled a small \npercentage of seeds (under 10% of a 2 million host seed list - 1200 \nthreads).  It appears that most of the seeds are in a separate queue so \nwould cycling through the queues (balance-replenish-amount to a lower \namount maybe 100) help cover all of the queues?\n\n--David\n\nOn 11/7/2011 2:44 PM, Gordon Mohr wrote:\n&gt; Heritrix is not very accommodating for an OPIC-ordered crawl in the way\n&gt; that it is not easy to reorder URIs inside a single queue, once they are\n&gt; queued. (You&#39;d have to peel them all off, sort, and re-queue... which\n&gt; might offset some or all of whatever ordering benefit you were hoping to\n&gt; achieve.)\n&gt;\n&gt; You can, however, re-prioritize entire queues via the queue-precedence\n&gt; mechanism. So you could bias the crawler to spend more early effort on\n&gt; sites that are large, or have a larger number of total inlinks, or other\n&gt; measures.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are performing repeated crawls, you could also use PR\n&gt; calculations from a completed earlier crawl to bias the ordering of a\n&gt; later crawl (because you would have PR values usable at the moment of\n&gt; queueing).\n&gt;\n&gt;  From a quick glance at the paper you reference, it doesn&#39;t seem like\n&gt; the magnitude of benefit for incremental-PR-estimation is very large. As\n&gt; they attribute to their footnote [11], and other broad-crawl studies\n&gt; have also suggested, &quot;even a random strategy can perform well on the\n&gt; Web, in the sense that a random walk on the Web is biased towards pages\n&gt; with high Pagerank&quot;. For this reason, I wouldn&#39;t be too concerned about\n&gt; crawling in PR-order unless you know you often have to cut your crawl\n&gt; short and thus strongly suspect more important pages are not being\n&gt; crawled... and even in that case, in a repeated crawl series you could\n&gt; adjust future crawls to offset this problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also important to note: a strict &#39;breadth-first&#39; crawl isn&#39;t a realistic\n&gt; description of any large politeness-limited crawl. Almost immediately in\n&gt; any crawl, politeness-to-servers means you may only be a few hops deep\n&gt; into big sites, while being arbitrarily deep on other paths that are\n&gt; spread over many non-politeness-bottlenecked servers. This certainly\n&gt; helps in discovering (and crawling to completeness) new and\n&gt; small-URI-count independent servers... though it leaves the risk that\n&gt; potentially &#39;important&#39; (by PR) pages, &#39;deep&#39; within large servers, may\n&gt; not be reached within some capped time/storage budget.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt;\n&gt; On 11/7/11 11:08 AM, David Pane wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi Noah,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; OPIC stands for Online Page Importance Computation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This scoring is in Nutch as a plugin\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here is a paper that shows that OPIC scoring is better than a breadth\n&gt;&gt; first crawl.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Crawling a country: better strategies than breadth-first for web page\n&gt;&gt; ordering&quot;\n&gt;&gt; http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1062768\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --David\n&gt;&gt; On 11/7/2011 12:18 PM, Noah Levitt wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello David,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; What is OPIC?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Noah\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; On 2011-10-31 12:37 , david_pane1 wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it possible to apply a crawling strategy based OPIC algorithm to a\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heritrix 3.x crawl?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We initially though that we could use the URI precedence, but it\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; appears that there isn&#39;t any provision for a URI&#39;s precedence to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change after initial assignment and as stated here\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/6022 by\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gordon, depending on how they are queued, they could be crawled out of\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Can anyone share some insight on this?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; --David\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
