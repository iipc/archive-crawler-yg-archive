How hard would it be to do it myself?\n\nOtherwise.. are there any other ways I can automate configuring/running\njobs in heritrix?\nThe web interface is very nice, but I need to be able to automate the\nprocess so that a real user isn&#39;t required.\n\nAny ideas? :)\n\n\nRegards,\nDennis\n\n\n\n\n"}}
