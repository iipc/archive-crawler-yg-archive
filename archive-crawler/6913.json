Any \nchanges to the CXML only take affect the next time that CXML is used to \nbuild a crawl.\n\nTo modify a running crawl, options are:\n\n  - write script in the &#39;Scripting Console&#39;, or mutate simple values via \nthe &#39;Browse Beans&#39; page. This can accomplish almost anything but \nrequires a deep knowledge of the crawl&#39;s internals.\n\n- Checkpoint and then terminate the crawl. Make compatible changes to \nthe CXML. (For example, if all-new beans are added the configuration, \nthose beans will have to make do without having any prior state saved in \nthe checkpoint.)  Build a new crawl from the altered CXML and resume \nfrom the prior checkpoint.\n\n// Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/15/10 1:09 AM, Mahmoud Mubarak wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; How can I change configurations in crawler-beans.cxml while the job is\n&gt; running and take the effect of change?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt;\n\n"}}
