I was going to look at the adaptive frontier to see how \nexactly it handled changes, if indeed it does anything special at all. \nAs far as I know, though, there&#39;s no signalling pathway in Heritrix at \nall for handling deletions, so that would have to be added, hopefully in \n  an approved manner.\n\nThe second phase would involve marrying the BdbFrontier with the \nAdaptive frontier.  The goal is to set the crawler up so that it \ndynamically and cost-effectively performs a synchronization over an \nextended time.  I looked at the BdbFrontier and discovered that there \nwas actually not much going on in this module, per-se.  In fact, I found \nthat the frontier interface itself is not at all what I expected.  Is \nthere any design documents or anything you can throw my way that would \nhelp me understand how the BdbFrontier works, and what I might need to \ndo to accomplish my goal?\n\nI&#39;ve done a fair bit of modification already (to support NTLM, http 1.1, \netc.), but this goes into areas I&#39;m not that familiar with.\n\n\nThanks very much,\nKarl Wright\n\n"}}
