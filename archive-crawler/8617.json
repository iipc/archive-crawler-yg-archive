If \nyou want to make sure it always &#39;wins&#39; the decision, put it last.\n\nIf you&#39;re getting many/all URLs from hostnames that aren&#39;t on your seed \nsites, then specific rules/settings you&#39;ve adjusted must be causing them \nto be ACCEPTed.\n\n From your description of the goal, I might try the approach of:\n\n(1) Start with the default decide-rule based scope\n(2) Set TransclusionDecideRule&#39;s maxTransHops to 0. Now, nothing that&#39;s \noff the starting domain will be ruled-ACCEPT simply because it appears \nto be an embedded/inline resource (IMG/FRAME/etc).\n(3) Add your regex rule, to ACCEPT URLs ending with certain desired \nextensions (like &#39;.exe&#39;), at the very end of the rules. Then, no matter \nwhat the earlier decisions – perhaps REJECT because they&#39;re on other \nhostnames – the last winning decision will be ACCEPT.\n\nIf you&#39;re then getting more than expected, you need to look at the exact \nURL/discovery-hops to the unexpected URLs and figure out what ACCEPTed \nthem. (Perhaps, a too-permissive regex?)\n\nIf you&#39;re getting less, you have to look at the discovery-hops that you \nexpected to work to find the desired URL, and figure out which one was \nREJECTed. (Perhaps, the &#39;.exe&#39; etc URLs are more than 1-hop from your \nseed/starting domain, in which case you&#39;ll need to allow the intervening \nhops.)\n\nGood luck!\n\n- Gordon\n\n\nOn 9/21/14, 11:05 PM, kapiljadhav4@...
