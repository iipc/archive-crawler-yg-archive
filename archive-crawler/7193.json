Tweaking the settings can make a big \ndifference, and there&#39;s also a lot more room for optimization in the \ncode if any team needed to really squeeze the most out of a small \nhardware budget. (We have often chosen &#39;more machines&#39; over &#39;more coding \noptimizations&#39; when we need greater throughput.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 6/29/11 9:48 AM, cosmicpioneer2011 wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; We have been using heritrix for a while now and we like it so far with\n&gt; all the pluggable modules and ease of extensibility. We see a big\n&gt; difference in the crawl rate. We ran two parallel crawls one with a seed\n&gt; url and no RegExp Decide filters and another with RegExp Decide rule\n&gt; filters and we see that the crawler with filters performs crawl rate at\n&gt; 6 to 9 URIs per second compared to the crawl without the decide filter\n&gt; performs at 60 URIs/sec (on Avg). And we would like to scale to\n&gt; performing the crawl at a higher rate since our needs are more.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our aim should be to get to &gt;500 URIs/sec which translates to 1.8\n&gt; Million/Hr. What is the max crawl rate that can be achived by heritrix\n&gt; crawler.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks, -Vinoth.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
