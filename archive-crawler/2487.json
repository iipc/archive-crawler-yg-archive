If so, there\nshould be a practical ceiling on the amount of time you have to wait\nbefore a pause takes full effect.\n\nEventually, the aim is to allow a checkpoint to occur even when some\nthreads are in the middle of long activity -- by checkpointing the\ncrawl state as if that URI&#39;s processing had not yet begun.
