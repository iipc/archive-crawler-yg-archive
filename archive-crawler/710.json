It was useful though to be able to copy the =\r\nfrontier\ninto a new package and mess about with it. That probably doens&#39;t r=\r\nequire \nthe package access to be permenantly revoked though.\n\nHow are you d=\r\noing with your re-crawl suff? I have become heavily sidetracked\nby other pr=\r\noject concerns at the moment and haven&#39;t done\nmuch more than think of a des=\r\nign - I&#39;ve hardly done any coding. When \ndo you think you might be able to =\r\nrelease something? \n\ncheers \n\nmark \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Krist=\r\ninn Sigurdsson\nTo: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\nSent: 7/26/04 10:19 AM\nS=\r\nubject: RE: [archive-crawler] Package access\n\nIf I recall correctly the rea=\r\nson for package access was that the\nFrontierMarker is dependant on the spec=\r\nific implementation of a\nFrontier.\n\nIt was never intended to work with any =\r\nother Frontier implementation\n(other Frontier implementations should implem=\r\nent their own\nURIFrontierMarker).\n\n \n\nI know it&#39;s three weeks later and a b=\r\nit late to come with this reply but\nI would STRONGLY advise against relying=\r\n on any implementation details of\norg.arcive.crawler.frontier.FrontierMarke=\r\nr in implementing other\nFrontiers (beyond what is specified in the URIFront=\r\nierMarker interface).\nThe truth is that if the standard frontier provided w=\r\nith Heritrix is\nchanged in any significant way (such as the recent eliminat=\r\nion of the\n&#39;pending&#39; queue) that may also affect the Marker implementation!=\r\n That is\nway it was limited to package access.\n\n \n\n- Kris\n\n \n\n-----Original=\r\n Message-----\nFrom: stack [mailto:stack@...] \nSent: 5. j=FAl=ED 200=\r\n4 18:30\nTo: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [archive-crawler] =\r\nPackage access\n\n \n\nmark williamson wrote:\n\n&gt;Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt;finally starting work on=\r\n the re-visting stuff:\n&gt;\n&gt;Is there are reason why stuff in the FrontierMark=\r\ner is package \n&gt;access only.
