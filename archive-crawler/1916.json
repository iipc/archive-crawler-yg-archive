Am I right?\n&gt; (But seems like the ARC files generated by Heritrix is different than \n&gt; others.)\n\nUnfortunately, there are other compressed aggregate file type\nout there that use the ARC extension, dating back all the way\nto DOS and early Mac, which can lead to confusion.\n\nThe ARC format Heritrix writes is only that described at the\nlink Stack mentioned, and the specification it links to:\n\n  http://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual.html#arcs\n  http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php\n\nYou can uncompress a compressed arc.gz with gunzip or just about\nany compression utility that reads gzip files -- but this results\nin one big .arc file.\n\nIf you want to &#39;unroll&#39; the ARC into a file-per-URL, choosing\npractical filenames for every URL can be tricky, and links\nbetween files will only inconsistently work unless you do\nfairly intrusive rewriting of the original content where necessary.\n\nWe can&#39;t yet recommend any good tool for doing this.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n"}}
