But, importantly, some normal operations count as a temporary \nfailure, so for example even if nothing goes wrong, a URI might get 1-2 \nretries used up when it gets deferred to allow DNS or robots refresh \nfetches to occur. Thus this value should never be below 3 for normal \noperation, and if you want any robustness against occasional/transient \nnetwork problems, could be significantly higher.\n\nThe default value of &#39;30&#39;, together with the retryDelay of &#39;900&#39; (15 \nminutes), means that even a network outage (near the crawler, or near \nthe target server) of 30*15m = ~7.5 hours won&#39;t cause a URI to be marked \nas a total failure.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 12/9/10 8:40 AM, Zach Bailey wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this property really do what it says? I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s limiting\n&gt; the amount of content being downloaded from a seed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just to clarify, I&#39;m crawling some domain lists where some domains may\n&gt; not even have an A record, and some may not have web servers running on\n&gt; them (but they DO resolve) and so I only want to try and connect to\n&gt; these domains once, otherwise the crawl runs very slowly as it retries\n&gt; over, and over, and over, and over... (with the default timeout of 20\n&gt; minutes and max retries = 30 this will take FOREVER)\n&gt;\n&gt; So I have configured the crawl in the following manner:\n&gt;\n&gt; FetchHTTP - timeoutSeconds = 5\n&gt; frontier - maxRetries = 2\n&gt;\n&gt; Does this seem to make sense for what I&#39;m doing? What crawl statuses\n&gt; should I be looking for to determine domains that a.) don&#39;t have a DNS A\n&gt; record (I believe the code for this is -1) and b.) HTTP connect timeout\n&gt; (I would expect to see -2, -4, or -8 for this)\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I ask is because I&#39;m seeing a lot of -50 crawl statuses which\n&gt; the glossary indicates &quot;appearance in logs may be a bug&quot;, so that has me\n&gt; a little worried.\n&gt;\n&gt; Happy Holidays,\n&gt; Zach\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\n"}}
