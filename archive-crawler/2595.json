I want 2 heritrix to run in my server. Before \nyour sol=\r\nution, I was able to run 2 heritrix by installing a second \nheritrix and ru=\r\nnning it using a different version of Java. Thank you \nvery much for the he=\r\nlp.\n\nRegarding the RIS open error, I am using heritrix 1.6. I usually \nenco=\r\nunter this error in authentication pages.\n\nRegarding the politeness feature=\r\n of heritrix, is there any way around \nit since our crawls are sanctioned b=\r\ny the webowners?\n\nThanks again in advance.\n\n\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; alxartes wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hope someone =\r\nwould answer the following inquiries.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. How can we run 2 simultane=\r\nous crawls? We wanted to run 2 or \nmultiple\n&gt; &gt; crawls at the same time bec=\r\nause we are time constraint and have a \nlot\n&gt; &gt; of web sites to crawl. We a=\r\nlso wanted that each website has its \nown arc\n&gt; &gt; file. I tried running a s=\r\necond heritrix at a different port but it\n&gt; &gt; would not start up. How can I=\r\n do it?\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re asking about running two instances on the =\r\nsame \n&gt; hardware and that you got an exception complaining about address \na=\r\nlready \n&gt; in use?\n&gt; \n&gt; Heritrix on a 1.5 JVM sets up listeners on two ports=\r\n.  There is one \n&gt; listening port for the web UI and then another listening=\r\n port for \nthe \n&gt; JMX Agent.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can stipulate the web UI port from th=\r\ne command line but \nspecifying \n&gt; the JMX port on the command line is a lit=\r\ntle awkward because we&#39;re \nusing \n&gt; the JVM&#39;s JMX Agent.  The JVM&#39;s JMX Age=\r\nnt takes its configuration \nas \n&gt; java system properties passed on the comm=\r\nand-line.  By the time the \n&gt; Heritrix command-line processing goes into ef=\r\nfect, the JVM&#39;s JMX \nAgent \n&gt; configuration has been acted on (Later we&#39;ll =\r\nput up our own JMX \nAgent. \n&gt; Then it&#39;ll be possible to dictate as a comman=\r\nd-line option to \nHeritrix \n&gt; the port to listen on).\n&gt; \n&gt; Meantime, you ne=\r\ned to use the JMX_PORT environment variable.  Here \nis \n&gt; how you would run=\r\n two Heritrix instances on same hardware, one on \n&gt; default ports of 8080 f=\r\nor UI and 8849 for JMX Agent and the other \nwith a \n&gt; UI on port 8081 and i=\r\nts JMX Agent on 8850:\n&gt; \n&gt; % ${HERITRIX_HOME}/bin/heritrix\n&gt; % JMX_PORT=3D8=\r\n850 ${HERITRIX_HOME}/bin/heritrix --port=3D8081\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re problem is o=\r\nther than the above, please paste in the \nexception \n&gt; you got on crawl fai=\r\nl (Check content of \n${HERITRIX_HOME}/heritrix_out.log).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. I al=\r\nso noticed that in the console, only one thread is active \nmost\n&gt; &gt; of the =\r\ntime. Is this normal? I am worried because I have allerts \nlike\n&gt; &gt; https:/=\r\n/guides-online.visitsingapore.com/tgls/loginProcess1.jsp \nRIS\n&gt; &gt; still ope=\r\nn.
