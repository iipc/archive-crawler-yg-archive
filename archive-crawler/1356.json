I attempted to create a new processor module that would send files \n&gt; over HTTP POST to a server instead of writing them to ARC files.  The \n&gt; module seems to work, but it did not appear in the menus in the web UI. \n&gt;   I attempted to fix this by adding the module to the end of the \n&gt; processors.options file.  When I create a job based on the default \n&gt; profile and add my processor, it works fine.  However, for some reason, \n&gt; when I create a profile that uses my new processor and base a job on \n&gt; it, it drops my processor and the postprocessors (basically, truncating \n&gt; the list of processors where mine should be).  Does anyone know why it \n&gt; would do this?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  When running a crawl, the program tends to run out of memory after \n&gt; about 0.25M URIs have been crawled.  I want the program to be able to \n&gt; run large crawls on 0.5 GB of RAM, and the less memory used the better. \n&gt;   Another programmer suggested using database software such as BerkDB \n&gt; (http://www.sleepycat.com/products/je.shtml) to act as a sort of \n&gt; virtual memory (storing crawl data on disk instead of in memory).  Is \n&gt; this feasible?  Is there something else I can do to conserve memory on \n&gt; large crawls?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much for your assistance.\n&gt; Xavid Pretzer\n\n\n\n\n"}}
