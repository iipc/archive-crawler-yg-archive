The AList is just such a handy place to stuff\n&gt; application-related information.  My desire is to pass info from the\n&gt; parent CrawlURI&#39;s AList to the child CandidateURI (who currently does\n&gt; not have an AList -- I wish it did!).  I guess I&#39;ll have to subclass\n&gt; CandidateURI to get this. \n&gt;\n&gt; So a protected createCandidateURI is a promising direction.  If this\n&gt; method could take the parent CrawlURI as well as the other stuff and\n&gt; return a new CandidateURI, then all might be possible.  Could you add\n&gt; curi to the arguments passed to createCandidateURI?  Or maybe it would\n&gt; be neater to pass just the curi&#39;s AList to the method? \n\nHere is the signature for the new method:\n\nprotected CandidateURI createCandidateURI(CrawlURI curi, UURI base,\n            String link)\n\nIt already takes the link&#39;s parent page curi -- or do you mean something \nelse.\n\nAs to the AList issue, thats a bit tougher.  Seems little point setting \nyou up if there is no place to stuff data to carry across the crawl. \nLooking at the creation of the CrawlURI from the CandidateURI over in \nthe Frontier, the way it currently works is that a new CrawlURI instance \nis created and a set of CandidateURI data is copied into it.  So you&#39;ll \nneed to have overrides in this location too to get your appended \nCandidateURI data added the new CrawlURI instance.\n\nWe&#39;re having a chat here in-house looking at a couple of things.  We&#39;ll \nbe back to you hopefully with a proposal that gets you what you need.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks so much for working on this.  I think Heritrix has great\n&gt; potential for being THE open-source crawler. - D.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Michael Stack &lt;stack@a...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; bergmark_d wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ooops, not so elegant.  Referring to my post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just a little earlier, --- there is no ref to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Parent URI (&quot;curi&quot;) in the schedule method.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So will be hard to copy info from parent to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; child URI.  This needs more thought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; D.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Try &#39;CandidateURI#getVia&#39;.  Returned type is Object but in an\n&gt; &gt; override context should always be an UURI instance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I also did some more refactoring.  I made handleLinkCollection\n&gt; &gt; protected (handlePrerequisites already was protected rather than\n&gt; &gt; private) and added createCandidateUri, a method that both\n&gt; &gt; handleLinkCollection and handlePrerequisites use to create a\n&gt; CandidateURI instance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let us know if this is still not sufficent -- or if you have better\n&gt; &gt; refactoring suggestion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; St.Ack\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;bergmark_d&quot;\n&gt; &lt;bergmark@C...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I believe making Postselector:schedule protected will do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trick. The main problem will be that CandidateURI&#39;s have no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AList (I wish they did!)  But thanks much -- this is an elegant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; solution.

So I would like to extend Postselector and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over-ride just this one method, but it is private.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How do you all decide which methods to make protected and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which private?  Maybe it would be nice to allow the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; application programmer to add attributes to the\n&gt; CandidateURI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before it goes onto the frontier, perhaps by some call-back\n&gt; or by factoring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out a protected and over-ridable method that decorates the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; CandidateURI.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I made the Postselector#schedule method protected so you can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; override it in HEAD.
