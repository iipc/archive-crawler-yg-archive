We&#39;d like your \nopinions before we proceed.\n\nThe IA and its major partners in the project (the libraries of the Int&#39;l \nInternet Preservation Consortium) are all equally comfortable with the \nApache License as the LGPL, and using the Apache license would allow \neasier integration with other Apache-centric projects of keen interest \nto our community, such as Lucene/Nutch/Hadoop. (We also extensively \nbenefit from Apache project libraries in Heritrix, and in the spirit of \nreciprocity would like our work to be freely reusable by other Apache \nprojects.)\n\nFor reference, the relevant Apache License is here:\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\n\nAny transition would be gradual, as we ensure notable non-IA \ncontributors approve the relicensing, and communicate that future \ncontributions will become part of the project under the new license.\n\nTo maintain the widest possible license compatibility in the face of \narcane and sometimes disputed matters of interpretation (such as whether \nApache License 2 is compatible with GPL 2), we may also continue to \noffer LGPL as an simultaneous license option, indefinitely.\n\nDo people have opinions, positive or negative, about this contemplated \nmove? Any concerns that should be addressed?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
