You could write a custom decide rule that rejects small \nimages, perhaps using ScriptedDecideRule, and apply it to your \nWARCWriter, since by the time the writer processes a url, it has already \nbeen fetched. But of course that doesn&#39;t save the time and resources to \ncrawl the url.\n\nIn some cases there are hints about the dimensions of the image, like \nthe height and width attributes of the &lt;img&gt; tag. Currently that \ninformation is not easily accessible in heritrix, and it&#39;s probably of \nlimited utility anyway since it can be used for scaling.\n\nThe pragmatic thing might be just to let it get the images. Or depending \non the ultimate goal, you might want to come at it from a different \ndirection.\n\nNoah\n\nOn 12/04/2011 06:41 AM, crawltst wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; Is there a Decide Rule for rejecting images with small dimensions (For example smaller than 100x100 px)?\n&gt; If No, how can I achieve this?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
