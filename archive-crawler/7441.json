We just want=\r\n to make sure no BDB corruption. Can we kill the process without any BDB sy=\r\nncing (checkpointing) and executing BdbShutdownHook ? Everything in memory =\r\nwill be lost but we do not care. Again, we want to restart the crawler from=\r\n a good checkpoint.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nViva Friend\n\n\n\n"}}
