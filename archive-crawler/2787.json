He wants to be able to POST to arbitrary html forms \narbitrary data. The example he gave was orbitz.com: filling in a \ndesignated set of flight cities, number of passengers, etc. (assuming \nrobots.txt and &#39;Terms of Use&#39; allowed crawlers).\n\nWe&#39;d have to extend our login so that you could list instead an \narbitrary set of URLs on a site and an arbitrary set of form data to \nfill in.  First we&#39;d crawl the page with GET and then POST the supplied \nform data.  If we allowed for multiple form sets, we&#39;d do the GET/POST \ncycle for each supplied.  I&#39;d guess that this feature would not be easy \nto implement given the vagaries of how each site does form handling.\n\nAre you only interested in a single site Andy?  Have you tried scripting \ncurl or wget or using the http libs in python/perl to get the data you want.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\nAndy Lee wrote:\n&gt; Yes, Michael. I saw the mail. But I still don&#39;t know how to do the \n&gt; setting of Heritrix to do that.\n&gt; Because there are some name/value pairs I need to assign for the \n&gt; webpages which have forms, an example will be perfect to understand. :)\n&gt; Sorry, I am a newbie in this field.
