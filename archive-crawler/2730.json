The crawl log is o=\r\nnly \nstill reporting 3 sites out of 20.  One of them, washingtonpost.com, \n=\r\nlooks like it may be rejecting our connections quite frequently \nbecause it=\r\n doesn&#39;t like how aggressively I&#39;m crawling.  Could be the \nsame with the o=\r\nthers.  \n\n&gt; \n&gt; If your rules are set to \n&gt; reject everything after 2 hops, =\r\nthen on a page that&#39;s exactly two \nhops \n&gt; from the start, every discovered=\r\n outlink on that page will be \n&gt; considered, but then rejected for being to=\r\no many hops (3) away. As a \n&gt; result, no outlink that&#39;s 4 hops away will ev=\r\ner even be \n&gt; discovered/considered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n\nHelps a lot tha=\r\nnks.  I was worried it was still going to that 4th hop \neven though they&#39;d =\r\nall be rejected.  Glad it looks like it&#39;s just an \nissue with these few sit=\r\nes.\n\nThanks very much.\n\n-Adam\n\n\n\n\n"}}
