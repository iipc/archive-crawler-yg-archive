Gross wrote:\n&gt; [Attachment(s) &lt;#TopText&gt; from David P. Gross included below]\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Gordon,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your reply.  I am using H1.14.4.  The fields that I am\n&gt; changing in particular are keyword, mysql server, mysql database, mysql\n&gt; user, mysql password. The control interface you are asking (if I am\n&gt; thinking of the same thing) is via xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080 which is the\n&gt; heritrix admin console.\n&gt;\n&gt; I attached a screenshot, but I don&#39;t know if it will be accessible\n&gt; inside the group.\n&gt;\n&gt; Based on your questions, I am thinking incorrectly.  I presumed that\n&gt; being able to change extractor fields inside the console is standard\n&gt; Heritrix function by virtue of the extractor being selected as a\n&gt; (writer) processor in the module tab.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am starting to understand that while I can change Heritrix\n&gt; configuration settings within the console, custom extractor specific\n&gt; fields though appearing inside the console are not functional without\n&gt; additional programming to hand off the changes to the .java file and\n&gt; thus recompiling of the extractor.\n&gt;\n&gt; I figured that since I can copy/paste URL seeds directly into the\n&gt; console, I could also change the other fields presented to me as well.\n&gt;\n&gt; It would be nice to change the fields on the fly inside Heritrix rather\n&gt; than going into the .java file for each run requiring new keyword or\n&gt; mysql credentials( what I do now).  I realize I&#39;ll have to pay for that\n&gt; convenience and talk to my developer if I get to the point of doing\n&gt; numerous custom keyword/mysql projects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for helping me with this insight.\n&gt;\n&gt; David\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Attachment(s) from David P.
