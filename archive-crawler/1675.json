How would I go about making the connection at the\n&gt; beginning of the crawl and then storing a reference to it somewhere\n&gt; that I can access it from a custom filter and processor?\n\nCurrently no general global store that you could stuff a connection or \npool handle into (If there was one, CrawlController would probably be \nits host).  Here&#39;s some ideas:\n\n+ Subclass org.archive.crawler.Heritrix and add into it db connection \nsetup on startup.  You&#39;d then make the connection pool globally \naccessible by saving the handle into a static.  This would allow you to \ncall HeritrixSubClass.getDbConnection() from anywhere to gain access  \n(You&#39;d have to change the heritrix launch script so it started your \nHeritrixSubClass).\n+ Or would setting up the db connection in a static block that gets run \non classloading inside in your Processor of Filter work for you or have \neither your filter or processor go to a Singleton that holds the db \nconnection reference and have it initiate the connection on construction \nor the first time its accessed?\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Rich Collins\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
