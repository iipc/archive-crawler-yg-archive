Gross included bel=\r\now]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hi Gordon,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply.  I am using H1.14.4. =\r\n The fields that I am\n&gt; &gt; changing in particular are keyword, mysql server,=\r\n mysql database, mysql\n&gt; &gt; user, mysql password. The control interface you =\r\nare asking (if I am\n&gt; &gt; thinking of the same thing) is via xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:=\r\n8080 which is the\n&gt; &gt; heritrix admin console.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I attached a screensh=\r\not, but I don&#39;t know if it will be accessible\n&gt; &gt; inside the group.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Based on your questions, I am thinking incorrectly.  I presumed that\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\neing able to change extractor fields inside the console is standard\n&gt; &gt; Her=\r\nitrix function by virtue of the extractor being selected as a\n&gt; &gt; (writer) =\r\nprocessor in the module tab.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am starting to understand that while=\r\n I can change Heritrix\n&gt; &gt; configuration settings within the console, custo=\r\nm extractor specific\n&gt; &gt; fields though appearing inside the console are not=\r\n functional without\n&gt; &gt; additional programming to hand off the changes to t=\r\nhe .java file and\n&gt; &gt; thus recompiling of the extractor.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I figured =\r\nthat since I can copy/paste URL seeds directly into the\n&gt; &gt; console, I coul=\r\nd also change the other fields presented to me as well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It would be=\r\n nice to change the fields on the fly inside Heritrix rather\n&gt; &gt; than going=\r\n into the .java file for each run requiring new keyword or\n&gt; &gt; mysql creden=\r\ntials( what I do now).  I realize I&#39;ll have to pay for that\n&gt; &gt; convenience=\r\n and talk to my developer if I get to the point of doing\n&gt; &gt; numerous custo=\r\nm keyword/mysql projects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for helping me with this insight.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; David\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Attachment(s) from David P.
