There have been many \nsignificant fixes, including some which resolve heap OutOfMemoryErrors, \nand the required configuration adaptations shouldn&#39;t be too difficult.\n\n(Also: while it&#39;s probably *not* related to your problem, the class \nFairGenericObjectPool which appears in your example error stack was \neliminated from the master development branch in August 2010.)\n\nThe stack you forward is probably an indicator of a secondary effect, \nrather than the primary problem.  It says that a thread was unable to \nget one of the &#39;writer&#39; instances (one per open file, usually only 1-5). \nEssentially that means some other thread either hung or crashed so badly \nwhile using a writer instance that the instance was never returned to \nthe pool for use by other threads.\n\nSo to figure out what really/originally went wrong, the key places to \nlook would be either a current thread-report (to find other threads \nstill holding writers), or closely reviewing the alerts/heritrix_out.log \nfor earlier errors during WARC-writing (that could have been severe the \nwriter was not cleanly returned).\n\nHowever, since you mention running out of java heap space, it&#39;s \nimportant to note that once an OutOfMemoryError has occurred at some \narbitrary place, it&#39;s very possible the running crawl/heap is \nunrecoverably damaged. We attempt to retain as much state as posible for \ndiagnosis, and sometimes you can even try to continue, but it&#39;s best to \nconsider that run as &#39;crashed&#39; and only use what&#39;s still running for \ninvestigation of the problem. An OOME in earlier WARC-writing could \nexplain the later &#39;Timeout&#39; stack you&#39;ve received.\n\nIf you can&#39;t quickly move to the latest 3.1 and each crawl is truly a \nfresh restart, then ensuring that you restart the JVM each day could \nhelp isolate later crawls from any lingering memory effects from the \nearlier, completed crawls.\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 1/3/12 6:18 AM, Pranay Pandey wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am running a handful of jobs - each one runs for about 20 hrs a day,\n&gt; terminated and restarted again the next day.\n&gt; I am noticing that while everything runs smooth for a while (a week or\n&gt; so), after that, some of the object fetch attempts run into indefinite\n&gt; cycles.\n&gt; This leads to memory hog, overrunning java heap space and ultimately the\n&gt; crawler crashes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Below is a portion of the log.
