This could be the \ncase if sites have explicitly blocked your IP, or if you&#39;ve hit a large \ncollection of related trap sites (such as wildcard subdomains) that are \nall unresponsive/intentionally-slow. The frontier report provides the \nbest clues if this is happening.\n\nAlso, the &#39;out&#39; bandwidth is *so* smooth for long periods that there \ncould be a cap or other traffic shaping on some overburdened link \nbetween the machine and the net.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
