I&#39;m hacking around on\nit to see how it works and such, and will be sending you the occasional\npatch when I find problems.  I hope they are useful.\n\nFirst diff is of the startcrawl.sh script, which was lacking some quotes\nin tests, and more importantly the test for -no-wui was broken so it\nalways ran no-wui.\n\nI also have some questions about the new CVS version of Heritrix -- I\nsee the order.xml format has changed dramatically.  Now I&#39;m trying to\nmake a crawl that takes just the front URL from each of a number of\nsites, but the new version doesn&#39;t seem to have the max-embed-depth\nparameter of a few weeks ago.  Just to sanity check:  Is it in there\nsomewhere, or shall I make my own filter for it?\n\nThanks,\n-Lars\n\n\r\n--Boundary_(ID_atdY0EK+B9b9qAQl6TsBjA)\r\nContent-type: text/x-patch; name=cvs-diff; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-disposition: attachment; filename=cvs-diff\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--Boundary_(ID_atdY0EK+B9b9qAQl6TsBjA)--\r\n\n"}}
