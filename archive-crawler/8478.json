All the URLs were immediately rejected with the same -6 \nstatus, without any DNS request. There&#39;s no problem in doing DNS lookup \nfor any other application (nslookup, curl, wget, ...) on the same machine.\n\nIs there any way to convince Heritrix to change the status of those URLs? \nI wouldn&#39;t like to restart the jobs completely as they are nearly at the \nend. Any help would be appreciated. We are still running Heritrix 1.14.4.\n\nThanks in advance,\n   Bert\n--\nBibliothï¿½que nationale de France\r\n--1710867-303-1393844483=:5192--\r\n\n"}}
