I checked the logs and the crawler seems to be stuck with the same link. Is there any way to get out of this problem? is there a method to skip that particular link at which the crawler is getting stuck. I did try to read the documentation but am rather confused. I would highly appreciate any kind of help with issue.\n\nthanks,\njanhavi\n\n \n---------------------------------\nAccess over 1 million songs - Yahoo!
