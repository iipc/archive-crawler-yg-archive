This crawl is just\nsupposed to crawl one site\n(http://www.angel-cloud.com/blog/) but it&#39;s still\nworking on it. I read the mails according benchmarks\nso i guess it might be or it&#39;s more likely than not a\nproblem with the settings (i don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a\nproblem with my internet-connection as i use a\nuniversity network to access the internet) so now my\nquestion is: what can be done to increase\nperformance?? \n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nMeet the all-new My Yahoo! - Try it today! \nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n \n\n\n"}}
