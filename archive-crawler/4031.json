For more info on the issue see\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-670\n\nIn general, the first and the last line of crawl.log should do what you \nneed. The 9th column has 17-digit time stamp that represents beginning \nof the fetch time plus the time in milliseconds that took to fetch a \ndocument. These two numbers combined should be the same as the 1st \ncolumn date. The first 14 digits of the 9th column&#39;s timestamp should be \nthe same as in the metaline of an ARC record. Keep in mind that only \nrecords with positive response codes are written to ARC files.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\ni.\n\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m looking for the best post-crawl report/log/file from which to\n&gt; extract the crawl begin & end times. I was using the first & last\n&gt; lines of crawl.log for these times but then I noticed that the time\n&gt; for the first ARC record occurs slightly before the date for the first\n&gt; line in the crawl.log. Is there a better place from which to get these\n&gt; dates so that all the ARC record dates will fall within them?\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; Andrea\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
