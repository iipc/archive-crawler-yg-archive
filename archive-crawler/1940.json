Our current theory is that it&#39;s =\r\na JVM GC\n&gt; issue; at least one crash output log showed a &quot;GCTaskThread&quot;\n&gt; a=\r\ns the culprit.\n\nIn fact, my latest run showed that exact thing.  Would you =\r\nbe\ninterested in a bunch of logs from those crashes?\n \n&gt; Using the &quot;-XX:+Us=\r\neSerialGC&quot; to force the use of the classic\n&gt; garbage collector (which is st=\r\nill the default on uniprocessor\n&gt; and &lt;2GB RAM machines) has, so far, clear=\r\ned our crashes up.\n\nThanks!  I&#39;ll try it and report back.  That would be gr=\r\neat if its all\nI needed to do!\n \n&gt; One other gotcha I *think* I&#39;ve seen wit=\r\nh the Sun 1.5.0_03\n&gt; 64bit JVM: using the nifty new &#39;jmap&#39; and &#39;jstack&#39; uti=\r\nlities\n&gt; seems to be correlated with JVM lockups, where threads\n&gt; wind up w=\r\naiting for wake signals that never arrive. In some\n&gt; such lockups, even a &#39;=\r\nkill -9&#39; won&#39;t exit the JVM -- only\n&gt; connecting to the process with &#39;gdb&#39; =\r\nand issuing its internal\n&gt; &#39;kill&#39; command works.\n\nI haven&#39;t had any thread =\r\nlockup issues, but I&#39;ll report back if I see\nthat behavior.  Actually, I gu=\r\ness there&#39;s always a chance that a\nToeThread is locked up and I wouldn&#39;t no=\r\ntice (or is there?).\n\n&gt; Hope this helps,\n\nThank you very much.\n\n&gt; Matt Itti=\r\ngson wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m having a problem (this time I&#39;m sure its actually with =\r\nHeritrix)\n&gt; &gt; with hard crashes.  I have the hs_err_pidXXX.logs and the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n heritrix_out.log, but neither points me clearly toward the problem.\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;=\r\nm running Heritrix-200505310807 (though I&#39;ve had crashes with\n&gt; &gt; previous =\r\nversions, including 1.4, as well) on a dual Opteron, with 2G\n&gt; &gt; of ram, ru=\r\nnning Linux 2.6.9, glibc 2.3.4, JVM 1.5.0_03.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is there some logging=\r\n I could turn on (or perhaps somewhere I could\n&gt; &gt; look) which could point =\r\nme toward the right direction?  I&#39;m guessing\n&gt; &gt; it has to do with a certai=\r\nn URL getting hit, which causes the crash,\n&gt; &gt; so if I could narrow down wh=\r\nat exactly Heritrix is up to right before,\n&gt; &gt; maybe I could figure out how=\r\n to skip the particular URL&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A little more information:  In the p=\r\nast, the crashes have mostly been\n&gt; &gt; consistent.  My previous usage model =\r\nwas to break large seed files\n&gt; &gt; into smaller chunks, and Heritrix would u=\r\nsually crash consistently on\n&gt; &gt; the chunks with problems.  Sometimes, re-r=\r\nunning a seed chunk which\n&gt; &gt; would cause a crash could run to competion wi=\r\nthout crashing (becase I\n&gt; &gt; retire host-based queues at 200 URL&#39;s, this co=\r\nuld be due to the bad\n&gt; &gt; URL being occasionally skipped for being out of s=\r\ncope), but most of\n&gt; &gt; the time the crash would be consistent.  I&#39;m now con=\r\ntinually loading\n&gt; &gt; seeds via cmdline-jmx.  I&#39;ve changed my program to out=\r\nput exactly at\n&gt; &gt; what point the crash happens (when the connection is ref=\r\nused), but\n&gt; &gt; that won&#39;t really make clear exactly which URL&#39;s are being c=\r\nrawled at\n&gt; &gt; the time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are there known bugs that would cause hard =\r\ncrashes I could look into?\n&gt; &gt; Would posting the log files to this list hel=\r\np debug the problem?  Is\n&gt; &gt; there logging I could turn on to show exactly =\r\nwhat was being crawled\n&gt; &gt; at the time of the crash?  Any other ideas of ap=\r\nproaches to take\n&gt; &gt; toward solving the problem?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -m=\r\natt\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
