Performance metrics -- I&#39;ve looked through the Heretrix site and\n&gt;     &gt; the performance information is not clear to me.  Does anyone have\n&gt;     &gt; metrics that they can share?\n&gt;\n&gt;     What metrics are you looking for?  Heritrix performance varies wildly\n&gt;     with the settings used, where Heritrix is in the crawl lifecycle, \n&gt;     JVM,\n&gt;     quality of your connection to the net,  what you are crawling, and\n&gt;     profile of the Hardware its deployed on. \n&gt;\n&gt;     This morning a partner from Iceland reported Heritrix, after\n&gt;     running for\n&gt;     4 days, doing a HostScoped crawl against 11k hosts, steadily\n&gt;     pulling at\n&gt;     a rate of ~15docs or 857k a second on a fairly decent machine (I\n&gt;     don&#39;t\n&gt;     have its exact stats other than JVM was using 1.2gigs of RAM).  We\n&gt;     ourselves are running comparable crawls on sets of slow machines\n&gt;     (999mhz\n&gt;     and 512k RAM with JVM using 300k) with each machine settled after\n&gt;     a few\n&gt;     days running at a rate of ~5docs a second.  Other crawls we&#39;ve run on\n&gt;     &#39;better&#39; hardware -- fast dual processors with loads of RAM -- have\n&gt;     sustained periods pulling 30-40 docs a second with intervals of 50-70\n&gt;     docs a second near the start of a crawl.\n&gt;\n&gt;     It all depends.\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; 2.  A list of organizations (besides the Archive) using Heretrix\n&gt;     with\n&gt;     &gt; descriptions of the scale of their usage.\n&gt;\n&gt;     You might go back through the archives.  In a few instances people\n&gt;     have\n&gt;     volunteered what they are using Heritrix for.\n&gt;\n&gt;     (If wanted, I can start a page that lists uses of Heritrix.  Send\n&gt;     me a\n&gt;     one sentence summary and a link to the Heritrix project if a\n&gt;     public link\n&gt;     exists and I&#39;ll add it to a public list).\n&gt;\n&gt;     Here&#39;s a sampling of what we&#39;ve used Heritrix for here at the Archive\n&gt;     (Numbers and descriptions of machines are coarse):\n&gt;     + Crawl of the .fr domain. About a month of crawling divided\n&gt;     between 4-8\n&gt;     machines using a mix of the 999mhz machines descibed above and\n&gt;     another,\n&gt;     faster 1.7ghz machine.  This crawl pulled down ~50-60million\n&gt;     documents.\n&gt;     + Crawl of all government sites for NARA to coincide with the\n&gt;     &#39;change&#39;\n&gt;     in administration.  This crawl lasted 4 to 5 weeks and pulled down\n&gt;     ~75million documents (6.5Tb) with the crawl split across 4-5 1.7ghz\n&gt;     machines.\n&gt;     - Crawl of sites that pertain to the Iraq war on a weekly basis.  One\n&gt;     1.7ghz machine pulling down about 300gigs a week.\n&gt;     - Crawl of a small set of UK government sites on a weekly and\n&gt;     6-monthly\n&gt;     basis.\n&gt;     - Monthly congressional crawl.\n&gt;     - Crawl of sites related to Indian Ocean Tsumami\n&gt;\n&gt;     Yours,\n&gt;     St.Ack\n&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Thanks\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     &gt;\n&gt;     ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;     &gt; *Yahoo!
