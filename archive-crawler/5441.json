It \n&gt;&gt; would be worth a try to set both these back to the defaults to see if \n&gt;&gt; the OOME goes away.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did that and the OOME did not reappear. I cannot say which of the\n&gt; two options was the cause (since I turned them both back to default at\n&gt; once) but now the crawler is still up and running for &gt; 48hrs. So I&#39;d\n&gt; consider this issue to be &quot;fixed&quot;. If you want me to find out wich of\n&gt; the above mentioned options was the cause, let me know and I&#39;ll do the\n&gt; two required &quot;experiments&quot;.\n\nGlad to hear the problem cleared up. I would like to know if only one of \nthe changes is enough to trigger the OOME -- there must be a bug here \nsomewhere. But if the workaround of accepting defaults avoids the \nproblem for you, it&#39;s not urgent.... whenever you get the chance.\n\n(The large max-size would make more sense, but ARC-writing isn&#39;t \nsupposed to be buffering the full ARC in RAM, nor should it be using \nmemory-mapped files that might exhaust addressable memory on a 32bit \nmachine. So there&#39;s still a mystery.)\n\n\n&gt; thank you for your help \n&gt; cheers\n\nYou&#39;re welcome!\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
