I&#39;d like to increase the rate until either the client or the\n&gt; server&#39;s resources are maxed out. At 2 pages per seconds, both the\n&gt; client and the server have plenty of bandwidth & cpu to spare.\n&gt; \n&gt; So far I&#39;ve reduced the frontier&#39;s min-delay-ms to 0, but the rate\n&gt; only changed slightly. I notice that only 2 of the 50 available\n&gt; threads are active at any given time. Could this be the source of the\n&gt; rate limit? If so, how can I increase the number of active threads?\n&gt; \n&gt; Btw, I own the targetted web server, so politeness is no concern.\n\nDelay is calculated as the time the last fetch took, times the \n&#39;delay-factor&#39;, but no less than &#39;min-delay-ms&#39; nor more than \n&#39;max-delay-ms&#39;.\n\nSo you should also zero &#39;max-delay-ms&#39; or &#39;delay-factor&#39; (or both) \nto completely eliminate politeness delays.\n\nHeritrix will still only open one connection to a single hostname \nat a time, but this may be fast enough for you. (An earlier \nfrontier implementation had an option for processing multiple URLs \nfrom a single queue/host at once, but the option was not carried \nforward to the current recommended frontier implementation. It may \nreturn as an option in a future version.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
