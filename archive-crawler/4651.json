Therefore, I don&#39;t think that you can have a breadcrumb trail \nthat is more than two links long without adding this feature yourself.\n\nThere are several ways to add this feature, but maybe the easiest way is \nto write a breadcrumb processor that will utilize the \nCrawlURI/CandidateURI dynamic attributes list (a.k.a aList). The aList \nis a map of key-value pairs for storing information about the URI that \ncan be accessed by other processors. This breadcrumb processor can \nmaintain the A_BREADCRUMB/List key-value pair where the list can hold \nall URIs visited in the path. Just keep in mind that for big crawls \ncarrying over the breadcrumbs might add significant overhead to the \noverall URIs state.\n\nI hope this helps.\ni.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Is there a way to figure out the &quot;parent&quot; URI that the current URI you\n&gt; are crawling was discovered from?  I want to create a &quot;breadcrumb&quot; type\n&gt; trail of the pages that are crawled and I can&#39;t see how this\n&gt; relationship can be discovered.  I would like to do this in an\n&gt; Extractor, so any help would be great.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; Andrew\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
