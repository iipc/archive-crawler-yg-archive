Which platform? How many seeds?\n&gt;\nSorry -- I should have been more specific.\n\nI&#39;m on linux/debian/sarge, and I use heritrix 1.2.0. I have the same \nproblem with both host and domain scopes (with the broad scope I have \nmemory problems, of course). I am experimenting with 1000 seeds (is \nthat too much?). I don&#39;t get any warning (besides those in the heritrix \nlog). From the wui, around the time when the crawler becomes very slow \ntypically there are only one or two threads active.\n&gt;\n&gt; Check the thread report and frontier reports to see where things are\n&gt; holding up.\n\nWhere do I find these? (Once I stopped heritrix)\n\nBtw: after I increased the max number of open files the crawler does \ndownload more stuff before getting stuck, which makes me kind of \noptimistic about that being the problem...\n\nThanks for the advice,\n\nMarco\n\n\n---\nMarco Baroni\nUniversity of Bologna\nhttp://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni\n\n\n"}}
