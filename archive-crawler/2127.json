It revisits sites according to a schedule, and adjusts\n&gt; the revisit intervals based on observed change rates of\n&gt; resources.\n\nI have looked int the class....\n\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t use HEAD or if-modified-since requests, but I\n&gt; believe the associated HTTPMidFetchUnchangedFilter will\n&gt; consult modification times and etags, when present, to\n&gt; make a quick determination that a resource is unchanged.\n&gt; If so, the GET will be aborted early (and the scheduling\n&gt; adjusted as necessary).\n\nAnd that&#39;s bad, I think, because aboding requests is much\nless polite than using if-modified-since. As far as I remember\n(loooong time ago, when the discussion started about HTTP/1.1)\nit is relative expensive to establish a connection. That was\nthe reason, why HTTP/1.1 added the keep-alive feature.\n\nOTOH, heritrix seems to delay between contacting a server,\nand that might be even more polite. So, maybe heritrix is\nnot the right framework for my spider, because my spider\nwould be in general as polite as heritrix unless a user\nfocuses on a particular site, then it should behave similar\nto a web browser (a few connections with keep-alive)...\n\nMichael\n\n"}}
