I have got list of 220 000 seeds (2.level domains) and I do it by SurtPrefixScope.\nMachine specs:\n900 MHz PIII\n4GB RAM\n4GB swap\nDebian Linux\n32b JVM\nI started java with JAVA_OPTS=&quot; -Xms1500m -Xmx1500m -Xss512k&quot;.\nBut after few hours i have got alerts with OOM exceptions and crawl stoped. I set 5 toethreads and I hope the crawl will go on without errors.\nIf it will be necessary I will copy my order file.\nSo question is: what is the most important settings�in so big crawl?\nThanks a lot.
