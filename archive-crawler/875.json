The site is\ncrawled with no problems, but this process stays stuck indefinitely.\nWhen I ran it manually, I noticed that it would just say &#39;Starting\nHeritrix...&#39;, and would keep writing a dot and never stop. My question\nis, how do I crawl a site and than once the site is crawled the\nheritrix process shuts down. I could have sworn that the same command\nuse to provide that function, but it seems now it just hangs instead.\n\n-Ahnu\n\n\n\n"}}
