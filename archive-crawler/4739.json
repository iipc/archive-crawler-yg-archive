I believe, but I am not sure, that during the \nrecovery the seeds would be re-scheduled if you use the original seeds \nlist. It would be easy to check by exploring the current recover log. \nAnother reason for the larger queued list can be due the newly scheduled \nprerequisites like dns and robots.txt URIs. However, I would think that \nwould not cause the queued list to triple in size.\n\nIn general, when recovering the crawl from the recover log, I have been \nusing the empty seeds list. When the seeds list is used for scoping, I \nwould create a separate scope file to mimic wanted scope.\n\nI hope this helps.\ni.\n\n\n\n&gt; Here are the stats taken from the last entries in the\n&gt; progress-statistics.log \n&gt; \n&gt; When the original crawl was terminated at day 19 into the crawl:\n&gt; discovered      queued   downloaded\n&gt; 4465380         372767   2900208\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that the &#39;recoverd&#39; crawl has been running for only 4 hours:\n&gt; disovered       queued   downloaded\n&gt; 4469048        1462892         3935\n&gt; \n&gt; Estimated Time for the &#39;recovered&#39; crawl to complete as displayed on\n&gt; the UI:\n&gt; Time\n&gt; 4h21m43s elapsed\n&gt; 67d5h53m16s remaining (estimated) \n&gt; \n&gt; I am a little concerned that it may be recrawling URL already crawled\n&gt; by the initial crawl. It seems odd that the queued number (1462892) is\n&gt; so high when after 19 days in the initial crawl the queued number was\n&gt; only 372767.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for any help,\n&gt; Mike\n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
