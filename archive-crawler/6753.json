(The 1.6 OpenJDK distribution has a bit of an odd pedigree, \nbackported from a 7 prerelease, and my understanding is that it doesn&#39;t \nget the same test coverage and bug attention as the latest Sun 1.6 JVM \nreleases. We&#39;ve historically seen some oddities that clear up when \nmoving away from OpenJDK.)\n\nIf choosing to run on a Java7 preview release, apparently the Sun and \nOpenJDK versions are in much closer sync. (We haven&#39;t yet tested on \nJava7, so there may be other issues, but there&#39;s less reason to believe \nthey&#39;d be different for OpenJDK.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 9/26/10 8:53 AM, raffaele messuti wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sep 26, 2010, at 4:47 PM, Gordon Mohr wrote:\n&gt;&gt; ...suggest there may be something wrong with the address you&#39;ve requested the UI bind its socket to.
