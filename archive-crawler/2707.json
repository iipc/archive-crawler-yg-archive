Services\n&gt; &gt; running here at the Archive depend on it being constant so we&#39;re even\n&gt; &gt; less likely to change it).\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Michael,\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;ve been putting JMX through some paces and found areas where embedding\n&gt; appears to give us functionality that may be more smoothly obtained than\n&gt; with JMX.  It may due to our limited understanding, but some of the JMX\n&gt; reporting and job control stuff was feeling a little clunky.\nMarshalling and unmarshalling for JMX and rolling/unrolling OpenMBeans \nis for sure clunky.  This project, http://crawler.archive.org/hcc/, \ntries to smooth things some, especially for those trying to manage a \ngaggle of remote crawlers.\n\nThat said, we&#39;re gasping for feedback on current JMX API.\n&gt;\n&gt; Before asking you anything substantive, I&#39;d like to work up a better\n&gt; statement of my thinking, and I&#39;m wondering if in the meantime you all\n&gt; have started a wishlist of proposed enhancements to JMX.\n&gt;\nA while back I petitioned for suggestions on what to add to JMX API \n(Here is the posting: \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1842). The \npetition may have been premature.  Since its basically working -- you \ncan&#39;t add/remove/reorder filters/processors or add overrides but you can \neffect most other attributes of a running crawl, etc. -- thought is that \nrequests for enhancements to JMX API should now just get filed as you \nwould any other request, as an RFE against Heritrix.  A few minor ones \nare all that currently exist. \n\nYou thinking something substantial John?\n\nThe ultimate goal is that all control goes via the one interface whether \nthe local web UI or a remote cluster controller passing the config.to \nall members of a Heritrix crawling cluster.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
