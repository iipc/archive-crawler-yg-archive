The reason for allocating this much memory is to=\r\n avoid out of memory errors since at times I put around 5 heavy sites for s=\r\npidering. The spidering goes through well but even after the jobs are done,=\r\n Heritrix consumes a substantial amount of memory with many threads alive.\n=\r\n\nHere is what the memory consumption looks like:\n\n1210132 KiB used; 1277056=\r\n KiB current heap; 4551168 KiB max heap\n\nIs there any way I can free up the=\r\n memory used by Heritrix since the idle time memory consumption is increasi=\r\nng?\n\n\nThanks,\nPrashant.\n\n\n"}}
