Seems like this report would be equally useful post-crawl.\n\n2) Has anyone developed a set of R or GNUplot scripts for processing the \nARC files of a finished job?  A set of scripts that can plot the \ndistribution of MIME types, URIs, etc. would be really useful to me, and \nI&#39;ll probably write them myself unless someone already has.\n\n3) I created a scant Heritrix entry on Wikipedia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritrix\n\nIf anyone has useful all-purpose tools for processing Heritrix crawls, \nthis may be a great place to post a link to them.\n\n\nThanks,\nFrank\n\n\n"}}
