I use the\n&gt; DecidingScope along with the SurtPrefixedDecideRule. \n&gt; I tried to mix both URIs and SURTs, the SURTs get parsed out with the\n&gt; following message:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Some items in seed specification were ignored. This may not indicate\n&gt; any problem, but the ignored items are displayed here for reference:&quot;\n\nIt is possible to include SURT prefixes as directives in the seeds file, \nby prefixing them with &#39;+&#39;. However, this only serves to *add* more \nacceptable prefixes -- it does not further restrict what can be crawled.\n\nThe above message is generated by the code which looks for plain seeds; \na second pass over the seeds file extracts the SURT prefix directives. \nHence, the equivocation: &#39;may not indicate any problem&#39;.\n\n&gt; So is it only possible to submit SURTs over a local surt-prefix-file\n&gt; (you cant submit it in a jar via jmx, right)? \n\nPer our JMX lead St.Ack, currently the only parts of a JAR file \nsubmitted as a job to run that are locally exploded (and thus available \nfor addressing via relative paths) are the order.xml, seeds.txt, and \n&#39;settings/&#39; directories. So it might work if you took the nonstandard \napproach of putting your surt-prefix-file inside the &#39;settings/&#39; \ndirectory and adjusted the path accordingly, but it&#39;d be safer for now \nto drop the file local to the crawler via other channels.\n\n&gt; I need own defined SURTs because i don&#39;t want heritrix to crawl the\n&gt; leading path of a given URI if the URI is pointing to a concrete\n&gt; document(e.g. if i submit\n&gt; &quot;http://www.example.com/example/example.html&quot;, i only want heritrix to\n&gt; get  the document &quot;example.html&quot; and not crawl\n&gt; &quot;http://www.example.com/example/&quot;; otherwise, if i only submit\n&gt; &quot;http://www.example.com/example/&quot;, i want heritrix to crawl down from\n&gt; that path). It seems that this behavior is impossible to implement\n&gt; using the existing scopes and rules. Switching of heritrix automatic\n&gt; surt building and defining SURTs only if i have a path seems the only\n&gt; way for me to achieve the wanted behavior, or is there an easier way?\n\nYou are right that the Heritrix process for automatically deducing SURT \nprefixes from seeds is working against your goal. The common case in our \nexperience has been that &#39;sibling&#39; pages for &#39;example.html&#39; with the \nsame preceding path are wanted along with &#39;example.html&#39;, so the \nauto-configuration deduced from seeds implements that.\n\nDepending on your other priorities, there are a number of ways to crawl \n&quot;http://www.example.com/example/example.html&quot; without ruling other \n&quot;http://www.example.com/example/*&quot; URIs in scope.\n\nAt the very least, if using a SurtPrefixedDecideRule, you want to turn \noff the default &quot;&quot;seeds-as-surt-prefixes&quot; setting, so that the \nauto-inclusion of the &#39;/example/&#39;-trunacted prefix doesn&#39;t occur.\n\nThen, some alternative options would be:\n- Disable/remove the &#39;Preselector&#39;. Then, seeds won&#39;t be checked against \nscope before being crawled, and any seed URI you supply will be crawled \nregardless of your other scope configuration.\n- Add a &#39;SeedAcceptDecideRule&#39; to ensure that seeds are automatically \nruled-in.\n- Change the crawl to something more broad -- perhaps beginning the \nrules with an AcceptDecideRule then knocking out URIs you don&#39;t want, in \ncontrast to the default &#39;reject all then start ruling things in&#39; \napproach. An accept-all which then rejects URIs more than 0 hops from \nseeds essentially means &quot;only crawl seeds&quot;, though often a late \nTransclusionDecideRule is also added ato go 1 or more hops as necessary \nto get inline/embedded resources.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
