Generally we&#39;ve simple accepted \n&gt; this and believed it to be of fairly little consequnce.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, this morning I got an e-mail from an irate webmaster \n&gt; complaining about this behavior. It seems that he gets an e-mail for \n&gt; every 404 error that occurs. He explained that this was due to a \n&gt; recent restructuring of the web, they were keeping an eye out for \n&gt; stray dead links that might still exist. Heritrix swamped his Inbox \n&gt; with 18.000 e-mails over the course a few days.\n\nSounds like he has a few links to fix (smile).\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;m not sure that there is anything we can do about this, but I \n&gt; thought I would share this here.\n\nThere is an extant RFE for putting an &#39;aggression tuner&#39; on extractors \n(&#39;[ 913002 ] Extractor aggressiveness needs to be configurable&#39; \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=913002&group_id=73833&atid=539102).  \nWe should have a go at implementing it.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; - Kris\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
