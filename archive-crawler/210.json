Let the crawler versioning scheme be MAJOR.MINOR.POINT_VERSION w/ \nqualifier of &#39;-dev&#39; while building toward &#39;stable&#39; versions. Examples \nwould be 0.1.1-dev, 1.0.23, 2.0.1, etc. \n2. Let our first release be 0.1.0. \n3. Let increments to MAJOR or MINOR merit branching. Let the branch be \nnamed MAJOR.MINOR (I think &#39;.&#39; is disallowed so will have to be \nMAJOR_MINOR).\n4. Releases made along a branch should only ever be bug fixes and should \nonly ever increment POINT_VERSION. Such releases should be tagged \nMAJOR.MINOR.POINT_VERSION (Keeping this scheme, we&#39;ll be able to easily \ndistingush branches and tags looking at cvs logs).  \n5. Adding significant functionality should merit an increment to MINOR \nnumber while a suite of new functionality would merit an increase in \nMAJOR numbering (This last bullet item is pretty nebulous.  I think \nit&#39;ll just be &quot;obvious&quot; when its time to roll the MAJOR rather than MINOR).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
