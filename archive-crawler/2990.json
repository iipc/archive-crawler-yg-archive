Seems like this report would be equally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useful post-crawl.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All the reports are written to files at the end of a crawl. In \n&gt; particular,\n&gt; &gt; the mime type info is written to &quot;mimetype-report.txt&quot;. So all that info\n&gt; &gt; is preserved after the end of a crawl even though it isn&#39;t \n&gt; accessible via\n&gt; &gt; the web UI.\n&gt;\n&gt; Just to verify, there is currently no way to view a Crawl Report once a\n&gt; job has completed, right?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot using current UI.  Heritrix#getCrawlendReport available via the JMX \nAPI might serve as an  entry-point finding old reports.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I am thinking of making a small enhancement that would allow a crawl\n&gt; report to be produced for any completed job. Clicking on any of the\n&gt; hosts at the bottom of the report would display the crawl log for that\n&gt; host as it does now, but each URL would be turned into a hyperlink, and\n&gt; clicking on the link would load the resource into the browser. This\n&gt; would be useful for browsing the crawled collection.\n&gt;\n&gt; If someone is already aware of existing software that does this, please\n&gt; let me know so I don&#39;t re-invent the wheel. ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; Frank\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
