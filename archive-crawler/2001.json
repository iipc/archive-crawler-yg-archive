These are Domain scoped and currently focus on HTML only. I \nam writing mirrors of the domains. I have another application which \nis charged with archiving the mirror(when the crawl job is finished) \nand moving it to another system for knowledge extraction, taxonomic \nclassification and ontology manifestation.I am just looking for \nsomeone to point me in the rite direction. I would like to have \nHeritrix add a line to a text file to signify the job is complete and \nready for archiving, transportation, and digestion by another \napplication.\n\nI assume I should just be able to extend whatever class handles the \nend crawl job cleanup to accomplish the above without messing any \ninternals up. I am trying to keep the Crawler completley independant \nfrom other components other than gathering the output in file format.\n\nOn a side note I have herd a rumor that only one instance of Heritrix \ncan be run per server. Is this true. It sounds like I could isolate \ntwo instances fairly easily. Is the issue with the IP, IE: can only \none instance of Heritrix run on one IP?\n\nBy the way the last help I got from this list was great! I am also \nstill interested in helping with development. I may soon have a R&D \ndepartment that will most likely be focusing some energy on Heritrix. \nPersonally, I am a friend of open souce so mabey we can get some \ncomercial bucks into the OS process and make everyone smile.\n\nThank you in advance. Any help is always greatly apreciated\nBrian M. Lima \n\n\n\n"}}
