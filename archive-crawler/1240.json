It can be\ndownloa=\r\nded from here:\nhttp://crawltools.archive.org:8080/cruisecontrol/buildresult=\r\ns/BRANCH-heritri\nx-Kris-ARbranch2\nIt is being developed in a branch of the =\r\nHeritrix project. So, aside from\nit&#39;s customization, the distribution close=\r\nly resembles current HEAD build.\n \nThe distro comes with a profile called d=\r\nefaultARtesting which has already\nset up the modules needed. For those want=\r\ning to build it from scratch, you\nmust do the following:\n \nSet Frontier to =\r\nAdaptiveRevisitFrontier.\n \nThen insert the following processors into the pr=\r\nocessing chain:\nChangeEvaluator - should be at the very top of the extracto=\r\nr chain.\nWaitEvaluator - in the post processing chain.\n \nThe ARFrontier has=\r\n pretty standard configurable settings. Nothing new there\nand the ChangeEva=\r\nluator has none.\n \nAll the &#39;good stuff&#39; is in the WaitEvaluator. It allows =\r\nyou to specify the\nfollowing:\nInitial wait. A waiting period before revisit=\r\ning the first time.\nMin and max values for the waiting times between visits=\r\n.\nIncrease and decrease factors on unchanged and changed documents\nrespecti=\r\nvely. Basically if a document has not changed between visits, it&#39;s\nwait tim=\r\ne will be multiplied by the &quot;unchanged-factor&quot; and if it has\nchanged, the w=\r\nait time will be divided by the &quot;changed-factor&quot;. Both values\naccept real n=\r\numbers, not just integers.\nFinally, there is a &#39;default-wait-interval&#39; this=\r\n is for URIs where it is not\npossible to judge changes in content. Currentl=\r\ny this applies only to DNS\nlookups. \n \nIf you want to specify different wai=\r\nt times and factors for URIs based on\ntheir mime types, this is possible. Y=\r\nou have to create a Refinement and use\nthe ContentType criteria. Simply use=\r\n a regular expression that matches the\ndesired mime type as it&#39;s parameter =\r\nand then override the applicable\nparameters in the refinement.\n \n\nSome know=\r\nn issues:\nURIs that fail (negative fetch code) can cause trouble. This is m=\r\nost\nnoticeable if you have transitive inclusions in the scope. I.e. a URI\no=\r\nutside the host your scope covers is deemed in scope because it&#39;s an embed,=\r\n\nbut it&#39;s robots.txt (for example) is not in scope because it is too many\ne=\r\nmbed hops away. This can cause the URI to be tried repeatedly.\n \nIt has not=\r\n been tested on anything more then 2 hosts (and small ones at\nthat).\n \nBy s=\r\netting the &#39;state&#39; directory to the same location that an another AR\ncrawl =\r\nused, it SHOULD resume that crawl (minus some stats). This is done by\nutili=\r\nzing some Berkeley DB&#39;s facilities and has not been tested well.\nEspecially=\r\n not if the crawl crashes badly.\n \n\nThe distro comes with the JavaDoc, whic=\r\nh contains some additional technical\ninformation for those who are interest=\r\ned.\n \n \nThe AR-addon is still in development and should not be considered s=\r\ntable.
