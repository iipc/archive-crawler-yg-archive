T=\r\nhe problem is that \none really must carefully consider where to put a decid=\r\ne rule.\n\nFor example, adding a PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule at the end of t=\r\nhe sequence \nwill always result in ACCEPT for any prerequisite document, ev=\r\nen if that \nprerequisite&#39;s URI has been declared out of scope by upstream d=\r\necide rules.\n\nWouldn&#39;t it make sense to offer the administrator some more c=\r\nontrol over these \nrules by adding something like an ANDDecideRuleSequence =\r\n(returns REJECT as \nsoon as it gets a REJECT) and an ORDecideRuleSequence (=\r\nreturns ACCEPT as soon \nas it gets an ACCEPT)?\n\nCheers,\n-- \nChristian Kohls=\r\nch=FCtter\nL3S Research Center\n\nhttp://www.l3s.de/~kohlschuetter/\n\n"}}
