I&#39;m wondering if somehow the IP address was emitted \n&gt; from an earlier discvoery of a DNS-name-containing URL, and somehow it \n&gt; got translated into an IP address-containing URL in the recover log.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks,\n&gt;  - Mike\n&gt; \n&gt; At 07:44 PM 3/14/2005, you wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Mike Schwartz wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hi,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I notice the recover.gz file occasionally has entries in an Fe line \n&gt;&gt; without\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any predecessor F+ line.  I had thought there would always be an F+ \n&gt;&gt; line\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for any URL before it would show up in an Fe line -- basically, you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; discover and add a URL to the frontier before you ever emit/crawl \n&gt;&gt; it.  Am I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; misunderstanding this?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I ask because the RecoveryLogMapper class I contributed recently \n&gt;&gt; makes the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; assumption noted above, so when it gets an Fe without a predecessory F+\n&gt;&gt; &gt; line it throws an Exception to indicate that situation wasn&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; expeceted.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hi, Mike.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Your assumption was correct: there should always be an &#39;F+&#39; (add to \n&gt;&gt; Frontier)\n&gt;&gt; before an &#39;Fe&#39; (emit for crawl-try).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can you easily reproduce the case where there is an &#39;Fe&#39; with no \n&gt;&gt; preceding\n&gt;&gt; &#39;F+&#39;, or is it a rare occurence in large/long crawls?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can you excerpt out all the recovery-log lines pertaining the the URI in\n&gt;&gt; question, as well as any crawl.log lines for the same URI, to see if\n&gt;&gt; that sheds any light on what&#39;s happening?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
