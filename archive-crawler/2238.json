Do you guys planning to leave compatibility with java\n=\r\n1.4.2 and heading towards 5.0 ?  In the code, \n\nline 104 from org.archive.c=\r\nrawler.processor.FilePrintWriter from\nCrawlerMapper.java\n\nand line 111 from=\r\n org.archive.crawler.util.SetBasedUriUniqFilter\n\nyou guys are using new Pri=\r\nntWriter(File file) constructor which I\ndon&#39;t think it is supported in 1.4.=\r\n2.\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html\nand on=\r\nly supported in 5.0 \nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/PrintW=\r\nriter.html \n\nSince ppl like us still in love with FreeBSD and wants to stay=\r\n with\n1.4.2 will have some trouble getting the update without updating the\n=\r\ncode (not that it is a big deal).\n\nWell, I just wanted to know which direct=\r\nion we are going, so that I\ncan alert my admin getting ready to move to jav=\r\na 5.0 if needed :)\n\nThanks for the wonderful software and support.  Feel fr=\r\nee to let me\nknow if I am wrong in any comment. \n\n- Jay\n\n\n\n\n"}}
