We are using  the HostQueuesFontier.   \n&gt; \n&gt; I tried 1.2.0, 1.4.0, and HEAD going against archive.org -- which \n&gt; directs you to www.archive.org -- and all seem to act the same \nusing \n&gt; HostScope and HQF (i.e. they don&#39;t follow redirected seeds).  \nThere \n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to have been a regression.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, this seems like something we should just do.\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried HEAD using bdbfrontier since HQF is deprecated, even in \n1.4.0, \n&gt; and this seems to do as you describe.\n&gt; \n&gt; You don&#39;t want to use domainscope?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n-------\n&gt; &gt; *Yahoo!
