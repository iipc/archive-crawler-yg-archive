The general pattern is regexing over the file \nwith the RELEVANT_TAG_EXTRACTOR pattern switching off the type of tag found.\n\nSee http://crawler.archive.org/articles/developer_manual.html#N104D4, in \nparticular section 11.2 for more on processors and ReplayCharSequence.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n&gt; .\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
