(Especially with regard to the Frontier -- \nbecause any changes there would require a little more work to bring to \nthe 2.x trunk.)\n\nWe would probably plan another release as 1.14.x (or even \npreviously-unplanned 1.16.0) to have an official 1.x release with such a \ninteresting contribution, even before trying to bring such code into 2.x.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nGoel, Ankur wrote:\n&gt; Hi Folks,\n&gt;             We have our own implementation of the crawl farm based on\n&gt; top of Heritrix 1.6. We moved to version 1.13 sometime back.\n&gt; As a part of our work we have extended the heritrix code and implemented\n&gt; a consistent hashing scheme for maintaining politeness\n&gt; and consistent distribution. We would like to contribute some of our\n&gt; distribution related code to the heritrix community.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me give a brief idea of what we have done that we would like to\n&gt; contribute. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Each crawl node (called crawl engine in heritrix 2.0)  is responsible\n&gt; for figuring out if it should crawl the recieved/extracted URLs \n&gt; or the right crawler node that should be crawling it and dispatches the\n&gt; URLs over JMX to the appropriate node. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. The crawl node uses the services of a &#39;DynamicCrawlMapper&#39; to take\n&gt; care of distribution. This is a regular heritrix &#39;Processor&#39; integrated\n&gt; into heritrix processing chain.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. The &#39;DynamicCrawlMapper&#39; uses the services of a &#39;Distributor&#39; that\n&gt; talks to different crawl nodes over JMX and uses consistent hashing \n&gt; scheme to figure the destination node for the URL. If the URL&#39;s hash\n&gt; falls in the bucket of the local node then it is scheduled directly\n&gt; into the local heritrix instance.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 4. The &#39;Distributor&#39; caches the info for all other crawl nodes. So in\n&gt; this environment every crawl node is agnostic of every other crawl node.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If the community thinks this could bring value then we can work towards\n&gt; scrubbing out our custom code and get all licensing/legal issues \n&gt; sorted out to get the code into heritrix.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; -Ankur\n&gt; \n\n"}}
