It works with full SDK?  Make a bug and I&#39;ll \n&gt;fix the manual.  This is 1.0.4?  Is it running the selftest when this \n&gt;happens because the admin webapp is all precompiled.\n\nHi,\n\nThis is 1.0.4 - built on our crawler machines at work and then \ninstalled on another machine. \n\nNot quite sure what&#39;s gone wrong then. I installed the same \nbuild on the crawler machine and it works fine (and I&#39;ve been\nusing it a fair bit since I installed it). \n\nThe error is just from a normal startup (with a -a to change the \ndefault password).\n\ncheers \n\nmark \n\n**************************************************************************\n\nExperience the British Library online at www.bl.uk \n\nHelp the British Library conserve the world&#39;s knowledge.
