What always NOTCRAWLED\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=152219847\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: cash_05\r\n\r\nHi all,\n\nI&#39;m new to web crawler. I download and install Heritrix into my Linux\nbox. Start the crawler like what the user manual said. Then login to\nthe WUI and created a crawl job using default setting. I put in\nhttp://www.testserver.com/ in the seed list.\nThe job start and finised fine. But with very little result return.\n\nIn my arch/xxxxxx.arc file, after the information section, only 3\nlines for every seed i used. for example,\n\ndns:www.testserver.com 111.111.111.111 200501010101 text/dns 58\n200501010202\nwww.testserver.com. 86400 IN A 111.111.111.111\n\nAnd the content of my seeds-report.txt is always like\n[seeds]                   [res-code]  [status]\nhttp://www.testserver.com -61         NOTCRAWLED\n\nWhy is this -61 code returned and why NotCrawled?\n\nI actually expect Herixtrix to work as Httptrack that will download\nthe content or mirror the whole site in the .arc file. \n\nWhat did i do wrong? Or how can i change the setting to enable me to\nmirror the site?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.  \n\n\n\n\n"}}
