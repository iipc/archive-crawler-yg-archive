I am currently using version 0.9.0. My \n&gt;objective is to limit the amount of data scooped from a site onto the \n&gt;ARC file. I tried using the HTTP Processor max-length-bytes and the \n&gt;Archiver max-size-bytes.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nDo you mean 0.4.0. You say 0.9.0 above.  We just released 0.6.0 on \nfriday.  Try it if you haven&#39;t already.  Lots of fixes and improvements.\n\nIf you&#39;re doing a broad crawl, you have the following options available \nto you:\n\nmax-bytes-download\nmax-document-download\n\nThese options are not available in a domain scoped crawl which seems to \nbe what it is you&#39;d like to do.\n\nTell us more about what it is that you&#39;d like.\n\nThe max-length-bytes options limits size of a particular download only.  \nThe max-size-bytes  is upper-bound on the size of ARC files written (See \nthe code here http://crawler.archive.org/xref/index.html).\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;The Processor max-length-bytes seems to work at some level as the \n&gt;requests are reported as length-truncated in the logs, but the actual \n&gt;HTML files still make it into the archive.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Archive max-size-bytes appears to be ignored. Looking at the \n&gt;code, it does not seem to be used by the ARCWriterProcessor class or \n&gt;any other class for that matter...I just starting digging through the \n&gt;code earlier today.\n&gt;\n&gt;I continue my experimentation and code reading, but figured, I&#39;d \n&gt;check in to see if I am missing something very obvious or if anyone \n&gt;had experienced similar behavior.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks in advance for your time,\n&gt;Seb\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
