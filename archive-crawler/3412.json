I received the following error:\n&gt;\n&gt;  INFO: I/O exception caught when processing request: Connection refused:\n&gt;  connect\n&gt;  org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector\n&gt;  executeWithRetry\n&gt;\n&gt;  I&#39;ve tried the following in my program:\n&gt;  System.setProperty(&quot;http.proxyHost&quot;, &quot;&lt;proxy&gt;&quot;);\n&gt;  System.setProperty(&quot;http.proxyPort&quot;, &quot;&lt;port&gt;&quot;);\n&gt;\n&gt;  where &lt;proxy&gt; is the proxy of my company and &lt;port&gt; is the proxy port.\n&gt;\n&gt;  However, it doesn&#39;t seem to work yet.\n&gt;\n&gt;  May this be due to authentication problem (where you have to enter\n&gt;  user name and password)? I&#39;ve tried to encode the string =\n&gt;  username:password using base 64 and put it in the &quot;Proxy-\n&gt;  Authorization&quot; field in the HTTP header in the order.xml file as\n&gt;  follows:\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;map name=&quot;http-headers&quot;&gt;\n&gt;        &lt;string name=&quot;Proxy-Authorization&quot;&gt;dGYhhtdDp0bGGGGGwM==&lt;/string&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  but it still doesn&#39;t work.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Am I doing the right thing here? If you have any idea about how to\n&gt;  solve, pls let me know.\n&gt;  Thanks,\n&gt;  Tim\n\n"}}
