I let it run for a few mins and then paused it.  Went to\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the View/Edit Frontier page and added a URI from a file, and was\n&gt;&gt;&gt;informed 1 URI was added from it.  Then I resumed the crawl.  Couldn&#39;t\n&gt;&gt;&gt;see anywhere that the new URI was getting crawled, queued, or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;anything. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Am I doing this incorrectly, or is the functionality not there yet?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I tried it.  When the URIs were not in scope -- which was the case for \n&gt; the first few I tried -- I got a -5000 in the crawl.log: e.g. \n&gt; &#39;20050301212535071 -5000          - http://www.archive.org/ - - no-type \n&gt; #005 - - -&#39;  (-5000 is code for out-of-scope).  But if I added URIs that \n&gt; were in-scope, it seemed to work fine.  Are you not even seeing the -5000s?\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Rob Eger\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Aptas, Inc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;*Yahoo!
