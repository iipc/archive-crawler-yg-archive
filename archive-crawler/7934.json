Heritrix goes through the set of rules in order and for each rule sets th=\r\ne status of the URI being tested to ACCEPT, REJECT, or PASS. At the end of =\r\nthe decide rules, the status in place is the one used, so even if your Matc=\r\nhesListRegexDecideRule rejects the URI, a later rule may change that status=\r\n to ACCEPT. For example, your regex might rule out the URI, but if after th=\r\nat rule you have a TransclusionDecideRule, that &quot;accepts any URI whose path=\r\n-from-seed ends in at least one non-navlink hop&quot; (https://webarchive.jira.c=\r\nom/wiki/display/Heritrix/Configuring+Crawl+Scope+Using+DecideRules) and is =\r\ngenerally used to accept embedded content such as images and videos no matt=\r\ner the URI pattern, the URI would be ruled back in to acceptance. You could=\r\n try moving your MatchesListRegexDecideRule lower in the chain of rules and=\r\n see if that helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lauren Ko\n&gt; Web Archiving Programmer\n&gt; UNT Librari=\r\nes\n&gt; ________________________________________\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com [archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com] on behalf of matteo.ceccarello=\r\n@...
