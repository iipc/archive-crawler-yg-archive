I did as you said and it work=\r\ned,\nThanks a lot.\n\nAbout multiple queuing(question 2):\nI read at the Heritr=\r\nix 3 new features that it has:\n&quot;# Introduction of parallel queues.  When cr=\r\nawling specific sites that can handle large amounts of traffic, the paralle=\r\nl queues option can be used to open many concurrent crawling connections to=\r\n a single site.&quot;\n\nmeaning if I want to crawl only a specific site by multip=\r\nle connections how can I do it? \n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, G=\r\nordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/16/10 1:39 AM, yotpo.official wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m pretty new to Heritrix 3 and despite my very good impres=\r\nsion of the code and it&#39;s ability, I&#39;m having problems with a couple of thi=\r\nngs:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. How do I config the cxml file so I will crawl only in a spe=\r\ncific domain, lets say http://example.com and only in sub domains of it?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; meaning if there is a url ads.google/.... i dont want to even fetch it.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; See the first Frequently-Asked-Question listed on the project wiki, \n&gt; =\r\n&#39;unexpected offsite content&#39;:\n&gt; \n&gt; https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display=\r\n/Heritrix/FAQs\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. How do i make the multiple queuing to work? does i=\r\nt happens automatically?\n&gt; \n&gt; What do you mean by &quot;multiple queueing&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 3. I configed the cxml file so I wont process all the jpg/gif/png files =\r\nbut my logs still show me (Mimetypes) i process them.  this is what I did:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;bean class=3D&quot;org.archive.modules.deciderules.MatchesListRegexDecideRu=\r\nle&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;            &lt;property name=3D&quot;decision&quot; value=3D&quot;REJECT&quot;/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n  &lt;!--&lt;property name=3D&quot;listLogicalOr&quot; value=3D&quot;true&quot; /&gt;  --&gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;!-=\r\n-&lt;property name=3D&quot;regexList&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;             &lt;list&gt;\n&gt; &gt;                  =\r\n &lt;value&gt;.*(?i)(&#92;.css(&#92;?.*)?)$&lt;/value&gt;\n&gt; &gt;                   &lt;value&gt;.*(&#92;.bmp=\r\n|&#92;.gif|&#92;.jpg|&#92;.png|bmp))$&lt;/value&gt;\n&gt; &gt;             &lt;/list&gt;\n&gt; &gt;            &lt;/=\r\nproperty&gt;  --&gt;\n&gt; &gt;      &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; what is my mistake??\n&gt; \n&gt; A definit=\r\ne problem is that your &#39;regexList&#39; property element is inside \n&gt; XML commen=\r\nt markers -- &quot;&lt;!-- ... --&gt;&quot; -- so is not a part of the active \n&gt; configurat=\r\nion.\n&gt; \n&gt; A possible problem could be the relative location of this rule wi=\r\nth \n&gt; respect to other scope rules; if this comes early, but then a later r=\r\nule \n&gt; ACCEPTs the same URIs, the later rule wins.\n&gt; \n&gt; You regexes also se=\r\nem a bit suboptimal -- the CSS part could be mixed in \n&gt; with the others, B=\r\nMP doesn&#39;t need to be listed twice, you may want the \n&gt; case-insensitive in=\r\ndicator for all suffixes, etc. -- but looks vaguely \n&gt; functional for your =\r\npurposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
