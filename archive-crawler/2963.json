I saw in the FAQ that there is a &quot;cmdline\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; control utility&quot;. Can I launch the tool from a script and then be\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; notified that a crawl job has successfully completed? If the crawler\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; is stuck in a crawler trap or if I just want to see what is left in\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; the crawl frontier, can I launch the WUI to check on the status in the\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; middle of the crawl?\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Sorry for any misunderstanding. I am aware of all the issues regarding\n&gt;  &gt; how Heritrix can limit download size, delay, etc. in comparison to wget.\n&gt;  &gt; My question is regarding the command line issues as stated above.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey Frank (We met at IWAW05):\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a FAQ on command-line control of Heritrix:\n&gt; http://crawler.archive.org/faq.html#cmdlinecontrol. \n&gt; &lt;http://crawler.archive.org/faq.html#cmdlinecontrol.&gt; It points to a\n&gt; simple tool we wrote that talks to remote Heritrix instances by\n&gt; launching a JVM to send JMX queries. Because the command-line tool\n&gt; lives only for the life of the sending of the JMX message and receipt of\n&gt; response from the crawler, it won&#39;t be around to catch the notifications\n&gt; emitted by Heritrix at key points during the life of a crawl. You could\n&gt; use the little command-line tool to poll on a period asking &#39;are you\n&gt; finished yet?&#39; (Or write code to register for notifications and then act\n&gt; on the events you are interested in).\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards the WUI, its either on or off. We&#39;ve not added tools to\n&gt; enable/disable the WUIR midcrawl. Why not launch with it enabled? Or\n&gt; you could also use the aforementioned command-line tool to get text\n&gt; versions of the reports the WUI exposes on state of frontier, etc., and\n&gt; perhaps go without the WUI altogether... though I wouldn&#39;t recommend it\n&gt; until you&#39;d first established familiarity with running crawls in\n&gt; Heritrix. The command-line output might in places assume previous\n&gt; familiarity with the WUI presentation.\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n\n\nThanks for the info, Michael!  I appreciate your help.  I&#39;ll be giving \nHeritrix a try in the next few days.\n\nFrank\n\n"}}
