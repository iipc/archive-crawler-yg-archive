(A better way to handle the requirement of only handling .html\n&gt; files might be to look for the content-type of text/html as in case\n&gt; #2, but I like that case #3 tries a different approach.)\n\nHello Paul-\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to edit my use cases.  I&#39;ve only been \nusing Heritrix a few months, so I hope what I have written so far makes \nsense.\n\nTo clarify, what I was wondering was if there was a way we could access \na URL like http://foo.org/bar/dir, and if it returns a redirect to \nhttp://foo.org/bar/dir/ we would accept it using our regexp.  This is \nprobably not the best approach to take though since it would be rather \nwasteful considering how infrequently we would get a redirect response. \n  I would just ignore this comment.\n\nI agree that a better approach would usually be to just accept all \nresources with a mime type of text/html, but I wanted to show how we \ncould apply a regexp to a URL *before* we grab it.  I think this would \nbe useful for some types of focused crawling.\n\nThanks again,\nFrank\n\n"}}
