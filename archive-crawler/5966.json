For \nthat, or for data that should be &#39;inherited&#39; by other URIs discovered \nvia the current CrawlURI, look at the addPersistentDataMapKey() or \nmakeHeritable() methods. If using either of these, make sure the extra \nstate you add serializes/deserializes cleanly.)\n\nAlso, do you need particular features only present in Heritrix 2.0.2? If \nnot, I recommend using 1.14.3; it is still better documented and more \nproven in production environments than the 2.0.x line.\n\nIn 1.14.3, the same general mechanisms exist but the implementing \nmethods/classes are slightly different:\n\n2.0.x                        1.14.3\ngetData()                 -&gt; getAlist()\naddPersistentDataMapKey() -&gt; addAlistPersistentMember()\nmakeHeritable()           -&gt; makeHeritable()\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nsendaman69 wrote:\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m computing a relevance score of each URI based on the HTML content of the URI in a processor and an external IE prorgam.
