Is there any documentation about the API differences?\n\nNo formal docs yet, sorry. The main changes to be concerned with are:\n\n(1) All configuration should now occur via getters/setters that fit the \n&#39;bean properties&#39; pattern (rather than the introspected static Key \nvalues of H2).\n\n(2) Processors always act on an instance of CrawlURI (rather than \nProcessorURI).\n\n(3) Depending on when your processor should run, it may now belong in \neither the &#39;fetch chain&#39;, the &#39;disposition chain&#39;, or (less likely for a \nforward-ported processor) the &#39;candidates chain&#39;, and the neighboring \nprocessors you position it relative to in your configuration may have \nbeen renamed.\n\n(4) If the processor keeps its own running state that should be saved \nalong with a crawl checkpoint, it should implement a toCheckpointJson() \n  like those implementations that already exist. (If the precision of \nsuch state across checkpoint-restarts is crucial, the processor belongs \nin the disposition chain rather than the fetch chain. If the processor \nhas more complicated data structures, such as its own on-disk database, \nit may need a more involved doCheckpoint() method; BdbModule provides \none example of such a method with regard to a BerkeleyDB-JE environment.)\n\nI suggest finding the bundled Processor most similar in intent to yours, \nand comparing its changes from H2 to H3 as a rough guide to porting.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
