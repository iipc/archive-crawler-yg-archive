There is no branch for 1.8 release (and heritrix-1_7_2 \nis an internal dev release).  Sourceforge CVS was in a state of flux \naround time of the  1.8.0 release and the branch seems to have been lost.  \n\nAt this stage, doing a CVS timestamp checkout is best way to get 1.8 \nsource.  To find the date-to-use, look at the cvs log of project.xml.  \nSee when the version number was moved to 1.8.\n\nOtherwise, get source bundle from sourceforge.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n"}}
