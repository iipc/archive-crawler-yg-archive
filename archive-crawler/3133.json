I can\nse=\r\ne it might be useful when doing more distributed crawling, like 20\nnodes. (=\r\nwhich is what we&#39;re hoping to do beginning next year).\n\nI think CHF-based C=\r\nrawlMapper should help in a 20-node configuration\nbecause you get more bala=\r\nnced diversion. Let&#39;s say each node can\ndownload 80M URLs, that would make =\r\nit a 1.6B crawl. \n\nAlong with top level partitioning, might be able to stre=\r\ntch it to a 5B\nscale crawl.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds sweet.\n&gt; \n&gt; + Did you use the ubic=\r\nrawler ConsistentHashFunction implementation that \n&gt; is in Heritrix in the =\r\ndsi.unimi.it jar or did you use something else?\n&gt; + If, lets say, a hostmas=\r\nter complained you were hitting her servers\ntoo \n&gt; hard, how did you figure=\r\n which of the crawlers the domain had landed \n&gt; on?  (Was it a problem for =\r\nyou that its effectively opaque which domain \n&gt; landed on which server?)\n&gt; =\r\n+ Do you have anything to say about how well the load was balanced \n&gt; acros=\r\ns the crawlers in practise.  I understand that in theory the load \n&gt; should=\r\n be evenly distributed but I wonder how the practise was.  Could \n&gt; you adj=\r\nust how much load a machine was carrying post startup?\n&gt; + Is the code prop=\r\nrietary and if not, would you mind sharing it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Good stuff,\n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
