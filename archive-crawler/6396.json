I will see if they are useable to\n&gt;&gt; me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, after some Testing: The modules are buggy, but I was able to fix\n&gt; them. The bug:  As both PersistLoadProcessor and PersistStoreProcessor\n&gt; inherit from PersistOnlineProcessor, they both try to open a database,\n&gt; in my case the very same one. This yields to an Exception in the\n&gt; BDBModule. Fixed by allowing access if the BDBConfig is the same in all\n&gt; Parameters. \n&gt; PersistOnlineProcessor also closes the Database, leading to an Exception\n&gt; when the second Processor in Chain tries to close it. Fixed by\n&gt; now relying on BDBModule to close the database. \n&gt; \n&gt; Please keep in mind that this is Heritrix 2, NOT 3. Is there still some\n&gt; maintenance for Heritrix 2? Are patches for it welcome?\n\nHi, Stefan.\n\nWe encourage people who have the skill to deal with its Spring/XML-based \nconfiguration to move to H3. In particular, in H3 the &#39;load&#39; and &#39;store&#39; \nprocessors can easily share the same BdbModule, similar to the fix \nyou&#39;ve described.\n\n(The assumption prior to H3 was that they would each consult distinct \nenvironments -- no necessarily a *good* assumption, but the way early \ndevelopment/examples of that functionality worked.)\n\nWe would welcome a tested patch for H2, but even if committed to H2&#39;s \nsource branch, a future H2 patch release is less likely than further \nimprovements on H3.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n"}}
