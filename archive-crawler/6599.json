Investigat=\r\ning the problem, many of them appear to be composed of a normal URL plus a =\r\ncontent-type appended to it. E.g.:\n\nhttp://newyorkyearbook.com/2009/07/text=\r\n/css\n\nIn this case, the page that takes there is: http://newyorkyearbook.co=\r\nm/2009/07/\nand here there is no link to &quot;text/css&quot; (neither absolute nor re=\r\nlative).\n\nAlso some scripts lead to incorrect URLs, such as:\n\nhttp://mediaf=\r\netcher.com/flv_player/swfobject.js\n\nthat leads to: http://mediafetcher.com/=\r\nShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash.7\n\nI suppose there is some bug in the way URL=\r\ns are extracted by some of the extractors (the JavaScript one and maybe oth=\r\ners). Does anybody know of a workaround to this problem?\nOr, can you point =\r\nme to the classes and methods to check in order to try to fix the bug?\n\nTha=\r\nnk you,\n\n    Davide\n\n\n"}}
