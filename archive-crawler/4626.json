(Alternatively, you could se=\r\nt the mximumum number of \nthreads \n&gt; to 1.)\n&gt; \n&gt; (We&#39;re unsure if the writi=\r\nng of multiple ARC files in parallel on a \n&gt; single disk, where they still =\r\nhave to contend for the disk head, \noffers \n&gt; a real performance benefit; w=\r\nork to profile this question and/or \n&gt; simplify the pool mechanism to minim=\r\nize the creation of &lt;100MB ARCs \n&gt; would be a welcome contribution.)\n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; joeyfreund wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi there\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am running a fe=\r\nw small crawls -\n&gt; &gt; * Each crawl has about 100 seeds from the same host\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; * I am using a crawl-depth limit of 0 (crawl the page and its \n&gt; &gt; depend=\r\nencies, but don&#39;t go any deeper)\n&gt; &gt; * I am using a time limit of 1 hour\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; * The size limit of an ARC file is set to be 100MB\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For some reas=\r\non each crawl ends up creating about 5 ARC files \n(about \n&gt; &gt; 1MB each) ins=\r\ntead of a single ARC file (as I expected, since the \ncrawls \n&gt; &gt; are fairly=\r\n small).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any insights as to why that is happening?\n&gt; &gt; Can I force=\r\n Heritrix to use a single file for each crawl?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Joey\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
