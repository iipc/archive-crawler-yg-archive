It\n&gt; appears to be one of the most advanced crawlers I ha=\r\nve looked into,\n&gt; and I have looked into a lot in the past few months.  \n&gt; =\r\nThe question I have is without completely analyzing all the java src\n&gt; code=\r\n,  where would the best place be to add the functionality to\n&gt; actually dow=\r\nnload or mirror a site instead of archiving it?  I need\n&gt; this functionalit=\r\ny to save copies of sites for evidential purposes.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   _____  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
