I were=\r\n unsure if this limitation is\nintentional - or just a shortcoming of the we=\r\nbUI.\n\nSo I&#39;ll try if it breaks anything if I add them manually to the\norder=\r\n.xml (and it would be nice for sure if a post 1.10 version of\nHeritrix woul=\r\nd allow me to do it via the webUI, too)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
