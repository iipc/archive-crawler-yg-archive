(Even if &#39;jstack&#39;\ngenerates error messages to STDERR, it may dump lots of useful\nstack info to STDOUT.)\n\n(7) Whether &#39;top&#39; shows Java process(es) as actively consuming\nCPU cycles or not.\n\nAny such hangs that you encounter, we would be interested in seeing all\nof the above info.\n\nWe&#39;ve been trying to diagnose several situations where java threads\nappear to become stuck, waiting for a notification (after\nan IO or synchronization wait) that is never delivered.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
