If\nHerit=\r\nrix were configured to never download a page which was not a seed\nand a Fro=\r\nntier was written that didn&#39;t track discovered or processed\nURL&#39;s (only cur=\r\nrently processing ones), is there any reason that\nmemory would climb to a l=\r\nevel which would inhibit spidering with large\namounts of seeds?\n\nDiscovered=\r\n URL&#39;s would be unimportant as only seeds would be spidered.\n History, like=\r\nwise, would be unimportant as I could make sure ahead of\ntime that the seed=\r\n list was unique.  Tracking in-process URL&#39;s would\nbe done to prevent overl=\r\noading any given host.  The seed file itself,\nthough I&#39;m not exactly sure h=\r\now this is currently handled, could be\ndisk-based using BDB to prevent over=\r\n large memory consumption.\n\nDoes this sound like a feasible track to pursue=\r\n or am I perhaps\nbarking up the wrong tree?\n\nThanks.\n\n-matt\n\n"}}
