It is especially likely\nto fail in database driven websites where =\r\nthe page is in fact created on\ndemand each time. But just because it is cre=\r\nated for each request does not\nsignify a corresponding change to the actual=\r\n document. And usually the web\nserver has no way of determining if or when =\r\nthe CONTENT changes. It is after\nall locked in the DB. \n\nSince the majority=\r\n of the sites that we are particularily interested in\n(news sites etc.) are=\r\n DB driven we need another way of determining if a\ndocument has changed sin=\r\nce last visit.\n\n- Kris\n\n\n"}}
