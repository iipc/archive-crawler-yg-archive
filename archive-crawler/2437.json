And=\r\n they use the same seed list.\n\nAfter a while machine A generate a list of U=\r\nRLs that contains non \n*.com links. Now, how do I add that list to machine =\r\nB? I know one \nway to add them is to (1) pause B (2) add the list to B&#39;s se=\r\ned list \n(3) restart B. But if I keep doing this, eventually the seed list =\r\n\nwill grow to big and I cannot use GUI to modify it. So let&#39;s say I \nbypass=\r\n GUI and modify the seeds.txt manually. Would that be a \nproblem?\n\nOr is th=\r\nere a better way to handle this?\n\nThanks,\n\n-joe\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
