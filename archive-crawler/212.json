Let the crawler versioning scheme be MAJOR.MINOR.POINT_VERSION w/ \n&gt;&gt;qualifier of &#39;-dev&#39; while building toward &#39;stable&#39; versions. Examples \n&gt;&gt;would be 0.1.1-dev, 1.0.23, 2.0.1, etc. \n&gt;&gt;2. Let our first release be 0.1.0. \n&gt;&gt;3. Let increments to MAJOR or MINOR merit branching. Let the branch be \n&gt;&gt;named MAJOR.MINOR (I think &#39;.&#39; is disallowed so will have to be \n&gt;&gt;MAJOR_MINOR).\n&gt;&gt;4. Releases made along a branch should only ever be bug fixes and should \n&gt;&gt;only ever increment POINT_VERSION. Such releases should be tagged \n&gt;&gt;MAJOR.MINOR.POINT_VERSION (Keeping this scheme, we&#39;ll be able to easily \n&gt;&gt;distingush branches and tags looking at cvs logs).  \n&gt;&gt;5. Adding significant functionality should merit an increment to MINOR \n&gt;&gt;number while a suite of new functionality would merit an increase in \n&gt;&gt;MAJOR numbering (This last bullet item is pretty nebulous.  I think \n&gt;&gt;it&#39;ll just be &quot;obvious&quot; when its time to roll the MAJOR rather than MINOR).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;St.Ack\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt;&gt;archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yahoo!
