The very latest H3 development \nbuilds are available from the new Jenkins-based build box, accessible \nfor now at:\n\nhttps://ia410225.us.archive.org:1443/\n\nGenerally if you would have been comfortable with the 3.1.0-beta a \n3.1.0-SNAPSHOT would be appropriate too (and we always appreciate the \nhelp testing the latest code in preparation for an official release).\n\n&gt; Is this the last version available? With subversion I downloaded heritrix3, is it older than heritrix 1.14.4?\n&gt; Why are two numbering sequences being used? I mean &quot;heritrix 1, 2, 3&quot; and then also &quot;heritrix 1.14.3, 1.14.4....&quot;\n\nRoughly changes to the leading digit (eg &quot;1.&quot;, &quot;2.&quot;, &quot;3.&quot; aka &quot;major \nversion&quot;) mean there are big, backward incompatible changes that users \nof previous editions will want to understand before upgrading. Changes \nto the second digit (eg &quot;1.12&quot;, &quot;1.14&quot;, &quot;3.0&quot;, &quot;3.1&quot; aka &quot;minor \nversion&quot;) indicate some new functionality but generally painless \ntransitions forward if you familiarize yourself with the Release Notes \nfor the releases between what you&#39;re using and what you&#39;re moving to. \nChanges to the third digit (eg &quot;1.14.1&quot;, &quot;1.14.2&quot;, &quot;1.14.3&quot; aka &quot;micro&quot; \nor &quot;patch&quot; or &quot;point release&quot;) mean mostly fixes and small changes, and \noften (but unfortunately not always) configurations can be brought \nforward with no conscious effort.\n\nEven as later major versions are developed, some people can&#39;t move right \naway, so small fix point releases will continue on the earlier major \nversion. (Heritrix 2 went through a second major configuration change \nafter its first release, but before any widespread adoption, so \nessentially everyone using Heritrix should be on either 1.14.x or 3.0+ \nand no other H2 point releases are expected.) Our expected next few \nofficial releases are:\n\n3.1.0 final\n1.14.5\n3.1.1\n\nThere will probably eventually be a 1.14.6 if institutions keep using it \nand there are necessary fixes that accumulate, but there probably won&#39;t \nbe a 1.16.0.\n\nAt this point, people starting fresh who can handle XML-based \nconfiguration editing, or people doing their own code customizations in \nJava, are urged to start with a Heritrix 3 release. People on projects \nthat already have experience with Heritrix 1 and are used-to or more \ncomfortable with its form-fields-based configuration can wait until they \nfeel they need something in H3.\n\n\n&gt; I am going crazy with the gzip problem: I cannot get nutchwax to import any arc produced by heritrix. Is this gzip problem solved in 3.1.0? I am using jdk1.6.0_25\n\nThe latest dev builds (including 3.1.0-beta and the 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT \nbuilds on the new build machine referenced above) have a workaround for \nthe GZIP-reading issues introduced by JDK6u23-and-above. If you can get \nyour nutchwax version to use the latest (W)ARC-reading code, which may \ntake a little work, it should resolve your issues. Or, you could go back \nto JDK6u22 or earlier.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n&gt; Thanx in advance to anyone who might help.\n&gt; Nacho\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
