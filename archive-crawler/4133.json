I turned on finer logging and it shows LinksScoper consider \n&gt; those links are out of scope. So my question is, why? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pchoy&quot; &lt;philipchoy@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I am very puzzled by this.  There are links (&lt;A href=...&gt;) in the\n&gt;&gt; following page that are pretty straight forward:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yuho/homepage/aboutme/aboutme.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am pretty sure links were extracted from this page (I had tried \n&gt;&gt; using\n&gt;&gt; ExtractorHTML and JerichoExtractorHTML and my own implementation)...\n&gt;&gt; I am using the default job profile so I expected the crawler will \n&gt;&gt; follow all the links found. For example, in the page there is:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;../publications/paper/hpc06.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[PDF]&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If I use http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yuho/homepage/publications/paper\n&gt;&gt; as seed, then I can retrieve the pdf file without problem.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At first I thought maybe it&#39;s because links were using relative \n&gt; path.\n&gt;&gt; But then there are a few links that are not. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Is there something special about this page or I need to change \n&gt;&gt; something in the crawler settings?  There is nothing mentioned in \n&gt; the \n&gt;&gt; logs and reports.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo! Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
