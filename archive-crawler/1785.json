The original rationale for putting tests beside the classes=\r\n \n&gt; tested was to avoid having to look in two places for code and as a \n&gt; c=\r\nonstant in-the-developers&#39;-face reminder that tests need to be written.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Recently Christian Kohlsch=FCtter proposed Heritrix do as other projects =\r\n\n&gt; do and move unit tests to their own directory.  In the main Christian \n&gt;=\r\n argues a src tree polluted by tests is tough to grok and that as tests \n&gt; =\r\nproliferate and become more involved -- if we start adding mock objects \n&gt; =\r\nand test data -- apprehension of Heritrix workings will get harder with \n&gt; =\r\ntime.
