The sessioned URLs look like \n&gt; this:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://joann.com/catalog.jhtml;$sessionid$JKOFFNYAAKUTIP4SY5NBHOR50LD\n&gt; 3OEPO?CATID=96029\n&gt; \n&gt; I tried several variants at creating a RegexRule for stripping out \n&gt; these sessionIds, based on the documentation in section 6.2.1 of the \n&gt; Heritrix user manual, but based on the log output when I uncommented \n&gt; the heritrix.properties org.archive.crawler.url.Canonicalizer line, \n&gt; I can see my regex isn&#39;t working.  The last regex I tried was:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;^(.+)(?:(?:&#92;$sessionid&#92;$)&quot; + &quot;(.+))$&quot;\n\nTry this for the matching regex --\n&quot;^(.+)(?:&#92;&#92;$sessionid&#92;&#92;$[A-Z0-9]{32})(&#92;&#92;?.*)+$&quot; -- and this for the\nformatting expression: &quot;$1$1&quot;.\n\n(You don&#39;t seem to have escaped the &#39;$&#39; characters properly)\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I must confess, I didn&#39;t understand  the reason for having two \n&gt; levels of non-capturing group escaping in this regex, nor did I \n&gt; understand why this regex needed to use string concatenation.  (I \n&gt; based the regex on the example in the manual.)  I also tried it with \n&gt; just 1 level of non-capturing group escaping and without the string \n&gt; concatenation, i.e.:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;^(.+)(?:&#92;$sessionid&#92;$.+)$&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; which also didn&#39;t work.\n\nThe two-level non-capturing group is hangover from copy-paste from the\nregex above it -- see BASE_PATTERN -- where one regex does multiple\nsession id types all of same format but for the key.\n\nThanks for pointing it out (I changed it).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone has suggestions, I&#39;d appreciate some help.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mike Schwartz\n&gt; Aptas, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
