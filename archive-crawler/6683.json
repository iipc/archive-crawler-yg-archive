In \nH3, also, it need not be a Processor -- it could be more like \nCrawlLimitEnforcer, a singleton bean receiving crawl events. It also \nmight not need explicit configuration of paths to monitor -- requesting \na list of all ConfigPaths, as the job resource page does, should be \nenough for it to know all volumes on which the crawl is relying.\n\nSo yes, your alternative would be a welcome addition to H3, and we&#39;ll \ndeprecate or just remove LowDiskPauseProcessor.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\nOn 8/13/10 8:28 AM, Kristinn Sigurï¿½sson wrote:\n&gt; Does this processor actually work? The regex it uses to parse the &quot;df&quot; command output does not seem to match the output on my servers.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve implemented an alternative that uses File.getUsableSpace() (introduced in Java 1.6) in place of &quot;df&quot; to get available space. getUsableSpace() sometimes fails on network attached storage (if unable to access available space info it will return 0) but works well on local disks.\n&gt;\n&gt; H1 uses Java 1.5 so this cannot be included in it. H3 however requires Java 1.6 so I&#39;m wondering if this could either replace the current LowDiskPauseProcessor or be offered as an alternative in H3?\n&gt;\n&gt; - Kris\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
