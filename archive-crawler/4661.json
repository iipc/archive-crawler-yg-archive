Therefore, I don&#39;t think that you can have a breadcrumb trail \n&gt; that is more than two links long without adding this feature yourself.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several ways to add this feature, but maybe the easiest way is \n&gt; to write a breadcrumb processor that will utilize the \n&gt; CrawlURI/CandidateURI dynamic attributes list (a.k.a aList). The aList \n&gt; is a map of key-value pairs for storing information about the URI that \n&gt; can be accessed by other processors. This breadcrumb processor can \n&gt; maintain the A_BREADCRUMB/List key-value pair where the list can hold \n&gt; all URIs visited in the path. Just keep in mind that for big crawls \n&gt; carrying over the breadcrumbs might add significant overhead to the \n&gt; overall URIs state.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this helps.\n&gt; i.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Is there a way to figure out the &quot;parent&quot; URI that the current URI you\n&gt;&gt; are crawling was discovered from?  I want to create a &quot;breadcrumb&quot; type\n&gt;&gt; trail of the pages that are crawled and I can&#39;t see how this\n&gt;&gt; relationship can be discovered.  I would like to do this in an\n&gt;&gt; Extractor, so any help would be great.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thanks!\n&gt;&gt; Andrew\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
