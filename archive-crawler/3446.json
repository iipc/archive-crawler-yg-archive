If anyone considers\n&gt; &gt; it useful, finds any bugs or=\r\n any major design-shortcomings feel free\n&gt; &gt; to report.\n&gt; &gt; It basically pe=\r\nrforms all the tasks that ExtractorHTML does - plus\n&gt; &gt; filling out FORMs d=\r\nefault values. The form handling part might still\n&gt; &gt; not be perfect but se=\r\nems to work just fine in my environment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Olaf Freyer\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I also started work on a custom extractor based on HTMLExtractor.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; My primary goal is to be able to fill out FORMs with default values.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I decided to not take the &quot;regular expression&quot;-way as the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HTMLEx=\r\ntractor currently does, but base my work on jerichoHTML parser\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (http:=\r\n//jerichohtml.sourceforge.net \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://jerichohtml.sourceforge.net&gt;).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The current results seem quite promising (it is just a few percent\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; slower than the HTMLExtractor but uses significantly less memory and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; it passes all unit test that HTMLExtractor does).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If everything fa=\r\nres well I might be able to provide my extractor to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cummunity nex=\r\nt month.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Olaf Freyer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
