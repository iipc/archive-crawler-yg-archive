I&#39;m a mere information resear=\r\ncher, not a Java or OS X expert\nand so have major gaps in many areas.\n\nI&#39;ve=\r\n run into the java_home environment variable issue before and somehow\nmade =\r\nthings run that needed it. This time brute force and awkwardness isn&#39;t\nwork=\r\ning for me.\n\nI&#39;m running a g4 powerbook with 1gb ram, OS X 10.4.6 with both=\r\n Java 1.4.2\nand 1.5 (5.0) installed. Earlier, I had not ticked the java pre=\r\nference to\nJava J2SE 5.0. Now it is. (Haven&#39;t restarted thought, which I wi=\r\nll do now\nthat I&#39;ve thought of it.)\n\nI&#39;ve downloaded the heritrix-1.8.0.tar=\r\n.gz file and have placed it in the\nrobertmothershead/applications directory=\r\n.\n\nNot sure what to do after this and am concerned about bolloxing it up to=\r\n the\npoint where my limited knowledge prevents me from fixing it.\n\nSo far, =\r\nI have performed a &quot;set java_home=3D/usr&quot; command in the terminal.\nThen tri=\r\ned to launch the heritrix-1.8.0.jar file through both browser and\ndirect ex=\r\necution. No luck. Similar results with earlier attempts.\n\nSomehow think I&#39;m=\r\n missing something simple and fundamental here. I&#39;d\nappreciate anything you=\r\n could do to point me on the right path.\n\nThank you again,\nrm\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; From: =\r\nMichael Stack &lt;stack@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: &lt;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&gt;\n&gt; Date: Sun, 04 Jun 2006 11:13:43 -0700\n&gt; To: &lt;archive-crawler@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] Heritrix on OS X\n&gt; \n&gt; robertmoth=\r\nershead wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Hi Group!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Meta-newbie here.
