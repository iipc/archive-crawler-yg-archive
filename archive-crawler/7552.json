The number of letters in that field is the number of hops from seed (unless it&#39;s more than 50 hops in which case it will be abbreviated).\n\nIt is possible to write separate crawl logs for the different numbers of hops, but it&#39;s not simple to configure. My suggestion would be to split the crawl log up in a postprocessing step, by examining the path-from-seed for each crawled url.\n\nNoah\n\n\nOn 2012-01-12 19:09 , ngzikai92 wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; This might be a little confusing, and I am just starting out.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we think about Heritrix, we can see it like a &#39;tree structure&#39; where the seed url is at the top layer, the additional urls that are found from the root at the second layer, and the urls that are found from the the additional urls at the third layer, and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Currently, based on what I can get from Heritrix&#39;s crawl.log, I am only able to see the list of urls Heritrix found/visits as a list, but I am not able to determine the layers of the &#39;tree structure&#39; from there.\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to know, if it is possible to customise Heritrix in such a way that I can crawl layer by layer and separating the urls obtained from each layer into separate log files?\n&gt;\n&gt; Much thanks and regards,\n&gt; Ng Zi Kai\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
