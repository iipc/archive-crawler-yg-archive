Looking at the heritrix_out.log file,\n&gt; resolved the heritrxing starting problem. I am in University campus and\n&gt; I am able to crawl the intranet sites. To crawl other websites I need to\n&gt; do some proxy settings.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kindly let me know how to do the proxy settings so that I can crawl\n&gt; other websites out of my intranet.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; FYI: Monkey-spider is a crawler based low-interaction client honeypot.\n&gt; Refer: http://monkeyspider.sourceforge.net/\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sashidhar.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Mon, 4/4/11, Gordon Mohr /&lt;gojomo@...&gt;/* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     From: Gordon Mohr &lt;gojomo@...&gt;\n&gt;     Subject: Re: [archive-crawler] Problem starting heritrix......

It can be because the port it&#39;s seeking to use\n&gt;     is already taken, or there are problems with the Java version on the\n&gt;     machine. So suggestions include:\n&gt;\n&gt;     (1) View any heritrix_out.log or heritrix_dmesg.log file that may be\n&gt;     created; it may have additional info.\n&gt;\n&gt;     (2) Set the environment variable &#39;FOREGROUND&#39; to &#39;true&#39; before\n&gt;     launching\n&gt;     to see Heritrix output in the launch shell (rather than for it to just\n&gt;     try reporting its startup before returning you to the shell prompt).\n&gt;\n&gt;     (3) Make sure you&#39;re using the recommended version of Java: the\n&gt;     Sun/Oracle 1.6+ JDK.\n&gt;\n&gt;     (4) Make sure nothing else is running on the port configured to be the\n&gt;     administrative interface (usually 8080).\n&gt;\n&gt;     Heritrix can crawl through an HTTP proxy -- it requires extra\n&gt;     configuration of the FetchHTTP processor -- but the failure to that\n&gt;     would show up as a different, later problem than this.\n&gt;\n&gt;     - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt;     On 4/4/11 12:52 AM, shashidhar wrote:\n&gt;      &gt; I am installing Monkey-spider... during the process of which I\n&gt;     need to install and run heritrix...\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I&#39;ve downloaded heritrix-1.14.4 and followed the steps for\n&gt;     installation as described in\n&gt;     http://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/install.html\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I did as described in section &quot;Running Heritrix&quot; in the above link.\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; Now when I type : % $HERITRIX_HOME/bin/heritrix --help\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I get\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt;&gt; Mon Apr 4 12:59:54 IST 2011 Starting heritrix\n&gt;     ....................\n&gt;     .........................................................................................................................................................................................\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; just the dots are appearing continuously but heritrix isn&#39;t\n&gt;     starting even after 30-40min.\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I am working from University Campus: The campus has a Proxy\n&gt;     server.
