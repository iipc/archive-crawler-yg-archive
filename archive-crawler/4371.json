I tried to open the source code in NETBEANS with \nh=\r\neritrix-1.12.1.jar, but I couldn&#39;t find any source code in that file.\n\n2. I=\r\n wonder how I can put my import my class to heritrix. Do I need to \nmake ad=\r\nditional jar file, and save it to library file and declare my \nclass in Pro=\r\ncessor.options? Processor.options is read-only and I can&#39;t \nmodify it.\n\nIt&#39;=\r\ns confusing and would somebody explain it how it works for beginners?\n\nI&#39;ve=\r\n read development documents but it didn&#39;t help me much.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
