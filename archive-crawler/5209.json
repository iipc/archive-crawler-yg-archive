Is very important to me.\n\nIf you were previously using crawl checkpoints, you can resume \nfrom the point of the checkpoint. (Only the URIs from that point \non will be repeated.)\n\nIf not, you can use the recovery-log method, which attempts to \nrebuild the state of the already-seen URIs and all pending queues \nby replaying a compressed recovery journal the crawler usually \nwrites to the logs directory. Usually only a small number of URIs \nwill be revisited in this case -- those that hadn&#39;t been cleanly \nflushed to the compressed log at the time of the first crawl end.\n\nSee this section of the Heritrix 1.x User Manual:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/articles/user_manual/outside.html#recover\n\nThe general process in Heritrix2 is the same, though some of the \nsettings and UI for setting up and resuming from checkpoints has \nchanged slightly.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
