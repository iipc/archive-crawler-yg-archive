I am not sure what you are      \ntrying       \n&gt; to =\r\ndo here.      \n&gt; 3) Accept OnDomainsDecideRule - what is you scope? Do you =\r\nwant to      \ncrawl       \n&gt; in domain or host scope?      \n&gt; 3) Again you =\r\nreject tOnDomainsDecideRule.      \n&gt;       \n&gt; &gt;      &gt; Thanks a lot for hel=\r\np.      \n&gt; &gt;      &gt; I&#39;ve added ContentTypeRegExFilter to the      \n&#39;midfetc=\r\nh-filter&#39; and      \n&gt; &gt;      &gt; &#39;write-processors&#39; sections, and now only ht=\r\nml/text      \ncontents are      \n&gt; &gt;      &gt; saved into the ARC file.      \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;      &gt;      \n&gt; &gt;      &gt; The one problem I couldn&#39;t solve is to accept o=\r\nnly URIs      \nthat end      \n&gt; &gt;      &gt; with the specified pattern (for ex=\r\nample, &quot;.doc, *.ppt&quot;).      \n&gt;       \n&gt; What are you trying to do?
