This problem starts to get\nre=\r\nally annoying as it happens on almost every big crawl I&#39;m running\n(500+ see=\r\nds) but rarly on small ones with less seeds.\n\nI haven&#39;t found a cause yet b=\r\nut have some theories what might cause it\n(even though I might be totally w=\r\nrong).\n\nThe most propable theory so far is the following:\nTwo ToeThreads wo=\r\nrking on different URIs from different queues come\naccross the same (so far=\r\n unseen) URI at more or less &quot;the exact same\nmoment&quot;. Both threads come to =\r\nthe conclusion that their URI is new and\ntry to enqueue it in the currect q=\r\nueue. While doing this both of them\nincrement to queuedUriCount by 1 but th=\r\ne queue itself being smart\nenough only contains one of them.\n\nI&#39;ll increase=\r\n logging to see if my theory might be true and report\nback later.\n\n\nIf anyo=\r\nne has any other idea in the meantime I&#39;ll be happy to hear\nabout it.\n\nThan=\r\nks alot\n  Olaf Freyer\n\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pandae667&quot;=\r\n &lt;aaron667@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi everyone here at archive-crawler,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m ex=\r\nperiencing a strange problem with my crawler (heritrix cvs +\n&gt; AddRedirectF=\r\nromRootServerToScope fix from Gordon).
