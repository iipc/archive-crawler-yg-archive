The problem is that in addition to the links, I \n&gt;need to know the position in the document that the links occur.  \n&gt;This should be possible with the regex Matcher, but it does not look \n&gt;like it is currently supported in the code.  Am I missing \n&gt;something?  Would this be a useful use case for anyone else?\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nIts not currently supported.\n\nTo know the position of each link in a page, you&#39;ll need to doctor each \nof the extractors you&#39;re interested in to log the link found and its \noffset. You might want to run the links found through UURIFactory; it&#39;ll \ntest for wholesomeness; might save you logging too many trash URIs. \n\nRelated, crawl.log gives a primitive picture showing the page a link \ncame out of.\n\nI&#39;m sure others would be interested in such a facility if you were to \ndevelop it.  Perhaps start by posting a patch to the list.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n&gt;Thanks,\n&gt;Jon\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Yahoo!
