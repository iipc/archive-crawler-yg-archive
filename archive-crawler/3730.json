I can see that they&#39;re\n&gt; consuming a couple of MBs when I look at the crawl report.\n&gt; Can anybody please give pointers on how to fix it or where I may be going\n&gt; wrong?\n\nIn the classic scopes, the additionalScopeFocus filter can rule things \nin with a &#39;true&#39; response, but not rule things out. A &#39;false&#39; just means \n&#39;this isn&#39;t something to be extra-added&#39; -- if the URL still is accepted \nby the general scope, it&#39;s still in.\n\nThat&#39;s why in the newer, recommended, and usually more efficient \nDecideRule approach, every rule has both a test *and* a decision to \napply. A proper sequence of rules can accomplish almost every effect \nimaginable.\n\nIn the classic scopes, to rule things out, set up excludeFilters.\n\nIf translating the classic approach to the chain-of-decide-rules \napproach, the rules would roughly be...\n\n(1) Set initial decision to reject\n(2) If seed, set decision to accept.\n(3) If in &#39;focus&#39; (domains in the case of DomainScope), set decision to \naccept.\n(4) If &#39;additional focus&#39; filter applies, set decision to accept.\n(5) If transitively included by referring hops, set decision to accept.\n(6) If &#39;excluded&#39; filter applies, set decision to reject.\n\n...with the last decision applied winning.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
