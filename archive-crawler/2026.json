By trial and error I\n&gt; &gt; have found that jboss-jmx.jar causes the problem. After removing this\n&gt; &gt; JAR Heritrix works fine. Further testing revealed that this problem\n&gt; &gt; still exists in 3.2.7 but is gone in 4.0.1 (at least I tested on those\n&gt; &gt; two). ...why that error happens, I don&#39;t know since I have not looked\n&gt; &gt; at the source of that JAR.\n&gt; \n&gt; Probably because we include the JMX reference implementation in\nHeritrix \n&gt; and its clashing with the jboss JMX implementation.  What happens if\nyou \n&gt; leave in place the jboss-jmx jar and instead remove from under Heritrix \n&gt; jmxri*.jar and the jmxtools*.jars?\n&gt; \n&gt; Does your bundling reveal the Heritrix UI or is it your apps UI that \n&gt; shows -- with your UI revealing the current state of the underlying\ncrawl?\n&gt; \n&gt; On and off I&#39;ve been experimenting trying to bundle Heritrix as an EAR \n&gt; (I&#39;m having a classpath ordering issue where commons-httpclient can&#39;t \n&gt; find the overlays that are in the heritrix jar. Anyone have any \n&gt; suggestions?).  The intent would be to have it so you could just drop \n&gt; Heritrix into a J2EE container and have both its UI and JMX interface \n&gt; auto-deploy.  Heritrix would then be available as a &#39;service&#39;\nuseable by \n&gt; other container &#39;services&#39;, and in turn, it&#39;d be possible for Heritrix \n&gt; to make use of container services such as clustering, messaging, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; St.Ack\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bye,\n&gt; &gt; Holger\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;stackarchiveorg&quot; &lt;stack@a...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Holger Stenzhorn&quot;\n&lt;holger@x&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have embedded Heritrix into an information sytsem I wrote\nand there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I call its API directly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Until recently I have used Heritrix 1.2 under JDK 1.4.
