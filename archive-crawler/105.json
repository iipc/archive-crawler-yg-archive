Most of these were\n&gt;   &quot;mailto&quot;s, which aren&#39;t yet being treated separately from other\n&gt;   URI types, and are especially likely to choke the java.net.URI\n&gt;   parser. Of the other 183, all appeared to be genuinely illegal\n&gt;   URIs. In a few cases, we might want to tolerate/patch-up the \n&gt;   page author&#39;s error to match the toleration/patching that browsers\n&gt;   do; I&#39;m working on such fixes to our extractor.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Gordon Mohr&quot; &lt;gojomo@a...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 14, 2003 11:03 AM\n&gt; Subject: [archive-crawler] Heritrix 8hosts crawl\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I started a Heritrix crawl of our first 8 test hosts early Sunday \n&gt; &gt; morning. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some initial results:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - In 24 hours, it had successfully downloaded over 79,000 URIs. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Memory footprint was under 400MBs at this time -- indicating \n&gt; &gt;   that with a similarly-constrained focused crawl we&#39;re likely\n&gt; &gt;   to be able to crawl 320,000+ URIs before exhausting the current\n&gt; &gt;   RAM-based structures. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - At the end of 24 hours, it was only fetching from two of the\n&gt; &gt;   sites -- match.com and city.fi -- just as with Mercator and\n&gt; &gt;   HTTrack towards the end of their runs. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - At 24 hours, it encountered a bug that halted its useful\n&gt; &gt;   fetching: while we&#39;re properly expiring IP info, we have\n&gt; &gt;   no facility for doing a fresh DNS lookup. (The &quot;dns:&quot; URI\n&gt; &gt;   is considered already-fetched, and thus will not be \n&gt; &gt;   fetched again.) So from the 24-hour mark on, the logs show\n&gt; &gt;   only &quot;unable to fetch because a prerequisite is unavailable&quot;\n&gt; &gt;   errors. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another bug noted: our timestamp-writing routine is using\n&gt; &gt; 12-hour based times, so 11:59pm is showing as 1159 rather than \n&gt; &gt; 2359, and 12:59am is showing as 1259 rather than 0059.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The logs and ARCs for comparison against Mercator and HTTrack\n&gt; &gt; are available on crawl09:/0/crawls/test-gojomo/8hosts/\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Gordon\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; &gt; archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
