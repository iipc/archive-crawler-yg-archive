Have you customized \nthe scope in a way that perhaps deeper material along the paths you are \ncrawling is being ruled out, by pattern, site, hops-count, or something \nelse?\n\nIf you it in fact crawled anything, your method of launching must be \nworking.\n\nThe mode of launching has changed a lot for 2.0.0, so your code would \nlikely need some updating. OTOH, more options for remote-controlling the \ncrawling &#39;engine&#39; without any Web UI at all are available, so it might \nbe an interesting upgrade for you from any 1.X version.\n\nStill, if it&#39;s working for you *except* ending faster than expected, \nit&#39;s probably a configuration issue rather than something a new version \nwould fix.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\ntgeorgio wrote:\n&gt; I&#39;ve read some posts on this and I am having a problem where I use the\n&gt; Java Process and ProcessBuilder classes to launch Heritrix as if it\n&gt; were launched by the command-line...but I get the same issue as:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/1272\n&gt; \n&gt; ...the crawl ends after only a few crawled files with no obvious error.\n&gt; \n&gt; The solution to that post was to upgrade to version 1.2.0 or greater\n&gt; and use the Heritrix Jar directly...is this the recommended way? \n&gt; \n&gt; If I upgrade to the latest (2.0.0) will my Process/ProcessBuilder\n&gt; method work? Or will I need to include the Heritrix jar and related\n&gt; jars in my project and call it directly?\n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestions are welcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Tristen\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
