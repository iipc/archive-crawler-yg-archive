With higher delays, the crawler will make less requests=\r\n and thus this will control (indirectly) the bandwidth.\n\nI also have seen t=\r\nhat I can use the scripting engine to manage sheet overlays, so I could wri=\r\nte a script that uses the REST API and makes the changes when they are need=\r\ned (without stopping the job).\n\nAlthough my approach does not seem to be co=\r\nmplicated to implement (and I try to do it today), I would like to know wha=\r\nt would be the potential problems and if there is a better way of doing tha=\r\nt.\n\nDo you have any advice or have you done anything similar?\n\nThanks,\n\nJua=\r\nn Manuel Caicedo\n\n\n\n\n"}}
