So far, I have used this\nas a scraper -- to go to a site/domain and grab everything.\n\nI am looking for a tool that will allow me to focus on a domain and\nonly grab a few pages based on content - for example, simple text\nsearching criteria.  For instance, I may be only looking for pages\nthat contain the word &quot;acre&quot; or &quot;juniper,&quot; or only pages that have\nlinks to more than two .mpeg movies. Of course, the more useful things\nare more complex.\n\nIn going through the documentation, I am am not clear whether or not\nthere is a filter or module to do this, and if not, whether it is\nreasonable to think I could write one.\n\nI am not sure if this fits into the philosophy of this tool.\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated!\n\nThanks,\n\nbillo\n\n\n\n\n"}}
