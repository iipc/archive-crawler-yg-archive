The ancho=\r\nr link\nis wrong since they have extra space (%20) at the end but in my old\n=\r\nheritrix 1.4, it extract successfully the correct link (index.htm)\nfrom Jav=\r\naScrip and discovery path is X on index.htm.  But in heritrix\n1.5.1 (cvs he=\r\nad from last week), the JS Extractor doesn&#39;t seems to\nsuccessfully parse th=\r\nat page or I am missing something.  I got 404 on\nthe url index.htm%20 and c=\r\nrawl is done since there is no where to go.\n\n&lt;body bgcolor=3D&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;\nonLo=\r\nad=3D&quot;MM_goToURL(&#39;parent&#39;,&#39;http://www.xyz.org/index.htm&#39;);return\ndocument.M=\r\nM_returnValue&quot;&gt;\nThe home page is at &lt;a\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.xyz.org/index.htm=\r\n%20&quot;&gt;http://www.xyz.org/index.htm\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nIs there any settin=\r\ng I am missing in the new version?
