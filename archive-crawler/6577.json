I have noticed \nthat, whereas version 1 and 2  save the crawl results into .ARC files, \nthis new version of Heritrix stores them in the new .WARC format.\n\nAlthough I&#39;ve been searching on both Google and on this list, I am still \nnot sure on how the stored WARC archive might be extracted and accessed. \nIs there any alternative to using the open source Wayback \n(http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/)? I am not very \nfamiliar with server side Java (and with java in general) and ideally I \nwould like to dispose of a more general purpose command line archive \nextraction tool, so I could build my own viewer on the top of it.\n\nThank you in advance,\nAndrea\n\n"}}
