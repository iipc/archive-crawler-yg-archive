The size boundary I had set was 700kB \nwith 150ToeThreads.\nMost of the time this was working fine - but at least once per week I \nran into those OOMEs.\n\nThe major reason behind the jericho based HTML extractor for me was \nimproved form handling -\nan experimantal feature I tested that was sending default form \nvalues/fields. It worked promising\non a small scale - but the risk of getting into serious trouble wasn&#39;t \nworth it. (Most shop owners aren&#39;t\ntoo happy  about a web crawler endlessly filling shopping carts...)\n\nIt might be worth exploring the options of wrinting a new HTML extractor \n- based on some\nother HTML parser that works with streams and doesn&#39;t require to loader \nthe complete document at once.\n\nRegards\n  Olaf Freyer\n\nChristian Krumm schrieb:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a question concerning the function getContentSize() in the class\n&gt; ReplayInputStream. The Java Doc indicates that the function will return\n&gt; the total number of content.\n&gt;\n&gt; So does the function deliver the total number of bytes in the content of\n&gt; this Steam?\n&gt;\n&gt; Background:\n&gt; To reduce OOME within the HTML-Parser, I want to only handle files which\n&gt; aren&#39;t to big. I already exclude non html Documents. But sometimes the\n&gt; crawler still gets an OOME and crashes. Adding pause-on-finish doesn&#39;t\n&gt; seem to help. I can&#39;t continue the crawl after an OOME.\n&gt; So I plan to only handle files which have content smaller than 30kb.\n&gt; Or is this a to big/ small value?\n&gt; Perhaps I may also restrict the maximum size of the header to 1kb?\n&gt; Any thoughts?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks a lot\n&gt; Christian\n\n\n"}}
