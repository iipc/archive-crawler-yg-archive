A few responses are\ninline below.\n\nAt Tue, 11 Dec 2007 17:58:57 -0800,\nPaul Jack &lt;pjack@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is it possible to explain the rationale for leaving order.xml\n&gt; &gt; files behind? I know that we have some investment in the format,\n&gt; &gt; and though we can of course move forward it is not clear to me\n&gt; &gt; from looking at the sheets.\n&gt;\n&gt; There were a number of reasons:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. The XML wasn&#39;t well-defined for most modules, so the benefits of\n&gt; XML were mostly lost. Eg, it would be nice to have\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;FetchDNS&gt;\n&gt; &lt;accept-non-dns-resolves&gt;false&lt;/accept-non-dns-resolves&gt;\n&gt; &lt;deciderules/&gt;\n&gt; &lt;digest-algorithm&gt;SHA1&lt;/digest-algorithm&gt;\n&gt; &lt;digest-content&gt;true&lt;/digest-content&gt;\n&gt; &lt;enabled&gt;true&lt;/enabled&gt;\n&gt; &lt;/FetchDNS&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ...so that configuration sheets could be validated using standard\n&gt; XML tools. But that would also be a huge departure from the existing\n&gt; order.xml, would require more infrastructure, and would make it more\n&gt; difficult to support third-party modules.\n\nWhile I agree that the order.xml format what a bit funny looking, I’ve\njust spent a bit of time convincing myself that a pretty reasonable\nschema could have been written to validate the order.xml format with\nrelax ng.\n\n&gt; 2. XML&#39;s nesting provides a good visual sense of structure for the\n&gt; old order.xml and for the new global sheet, but didn&#39;t work so well\n&gt; for override sheets, which typically contain only a few settings.\n&gt; We&#39;d either have to nest many levels of empty tags to get to the\n&gt; actual overrides, or have two different XML formats for the global\n&gt; sheet and override sheets.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense.\n\n&gt; 3. The one-setting-per-line format plays well with command-line tools\n&gt; such as diff.\n\nAlso makes sense.\n\n&gt; 4. The one-setting-per-line format closely resembles the new JMX API\n&gt; for modifying sheets. In particular, code used for JMX transport of\n&gt; settings is re-used to read/write the sheet files.\n\nAha. This makes even more sense.\n\nThanks for your detailed answers. If I seem reluctant to leave behind\nthe order.xml format, it is not for a particular love of xml or the\norder.xml format. It is simply that we have infrastructure deployed\nthat makes use of order.xml. Additionally, I have been developing an\nHTTP interface for Heritrix which extends the order.xml format to\nallow creating jobs, retrieving data, etc. from a running Heritrix\ninstance using HTTP (rather than JMX), and I am going to have to\ndetermine how to rework this to work with the new settings format. I\nhad not realized until a few days ago that the new settings had\nprogressed so far and that order.xml files were to be left behind.\n\n&gt; […]\n&gt; The second one is not an empty string; it&#39;s saying &quot;Create a new list\n&gt; that will only contain String values.&quot; To add an elements to the list\n&gt; you&#39;d use:\n&gt;\n&gt; root:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers:0=string, audio/*;\n&gt; q=0.2, audio/basic\n&gt; root:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers:1=string, text/*, text/\n&gt; html, text/html;level=1\n\nOk, so a distinction is made between primitives and objects,\nbasically.\n\nSince the order of the lines matters for maps, can you do something to\nappend to a list? For instance:\n\nroot:controller:processors:HTTP:accept-headers:_=string, audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic\n\nJust a though, since I generally dislike hard coding the index of a\nlist.\n\n&gt; &gt; Why is the config.txt file necessary?\n&gt;\n&gt; It bootstraps the settings system. Since the settings system itself\n&gt; uses a BDB, we needed a place to put the configuration for BDB.\n\nMake sense, thanks.\n\n&gt; &gt; Can one define any settings in it?\n&gt;\n&gt; No; the contents of config.txt are predefined. The valid properties\n&gt; are all listed in the file; anything not listed is simply ignored.\n\nOk. Thanks.\n\n&gt; &gt; What is the difference between ‘primary, org.archive[...]’ and\n&gt; &gt; ‘object, org.archive[...]’?\n&gt;\n&gt; Each class of object can have one &quot;primary&quot; object nominated in the\n&gt; global sheet. If a setting uses the &quot;primary&quot; tag then the object\n&gt; created is registered as the primary.\n&gt;\n&gt; Primary objects are automatically selected as the default value for\n&gt; most module settings. For instance, FetchHTTP has a server-cache\n&gt; setting for specifying the ServerCache to use with FetchHTTP. The\n&gt; default value for that setting is to use the &quot;primary&quot; ServerCache.\n&gt; In this way only one ServerCache instance needs to be specified in\n&gt; the sheet, and all the modules that need it just find it.\n\nI had assumed (correctly, I think) that in the past the names of\ncertain objects determined their primary-ness (for instance, the\nobject named ‘scope’ was the scope used for the crawl). This seems to\nmake more sense than enforcing a particular name for the settings.\n\nbest,\nErik Hetzner\n;; Erik Hetzner, California Digital Library\n;; gnupg key id: 1024D/01DB07E3\n\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Wed_Dec_12_11:25:51_2007-1\r\nContent-Type: application/pgp-signature\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--pgp-sign-Multipart_Wed_Dec_12_11:25:51_2007-1--\r\n\n"}}
