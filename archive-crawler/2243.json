Do you guys planning to leave compatibility with java\n&gt; 1.4.2 and heading towards 5.0 ?  In the code, \n&gt; \n&gt; line 104 from org.archive.crawler.processor.FilePrintWriter from\n&gt; CrawlerMapper.java\n&gt; \n&gt; and line 111 from org.archive.crawler.util.SetBasedUriUniqFilter\n&gt; \n&gt; you guys are using new PrintWriter(File file) constructor which I\n&gt; don&#39;t think it is supported in 1.4.2.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html\n&gt; and only supported in 5.0 \n&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html \n&gt; \n&gt; Since ppl like us still in love with FreeBSD and wants to stay with\n&gt; 1.4.2 will have some trouble getting the update without updating the\n&gt; code (not that it is a big deal).\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, I just wanted to know which direction we are going, so that I\n&gt; can alert my admin getting ready to move to java 5.0 if needed :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the wonderful software and support.  Feel free to let me\n&gt; know if I am wrong in any comment. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Jay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
