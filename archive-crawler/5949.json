When you\ndow=\r\nnload the warc from archive.org and test it against your code, each\nrecord =\r\nis compressed to specification so it works. When you uncompress\nit then man=\r\nually recompress the entire file yourself, each record is no\nlonger individ=\r\nually compressed so it is failing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lauren Ko\n&gt; Digital Projects Unit\n&gt; =\r\nUniversity of North Texas Libraries\n&gt; _____________________________________=\r\n___\n&gt; From: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n[archive-crawler@...=\r\nm] On Behalf Of sykushel [shaulk@...]\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, July 28, 2009 1:58 A=\r\nM\n&gt; To: archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [archive-crawler] Readin=\r\ng warc and warc.gz files\n&gt;\n&gt; I am using the following code to read both war=\r\nc and warc.gz files.\n&gt;\n&gt;                                warcReader =3D WARC=\r\nReaderFactory.get(new\nFile(warcPath));\n&gt;\n&gt;             Iterator&lt;ArchiveReco=\r\nrd&gt; it =3D warcReader.iterator();\n&gt;             int counter=3D0;\n&gt;         =\r\n    while (it.hasNext()) {\n&gt;\n&gt;                 ArchiveRecord record =3D it.=\r\nnext();\n&gt;                 counter++;\n&gt;             }\n&gt;             System.o=\r\nut.println(&quot;Num of records in file is: &quot;+counter);\n&gt;\n&gt; I tested this with t=\r\nhe file downloaded from\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/ExampleArcAndWarcFil=\r\nes and it worked\nfine, I the decompressed the file and again it worked OK, =\r\nbut if I\ncompress the decompressed file, it will not manage to read more th=\r\nen 1\nrecord.\n&gt; The issue I have with warc file that I created myself.\n&gt; I h=\r\nave arc files that I created using the crawler, and then converted\nthem to =\r\nwarc using the Arc2Warc().transform call.\n&gt; The code works fine for the reg=\r\nular warc files, but if I compress them\nto warc.gz, it will never pass the =\r\nfirst record.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any idea?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
