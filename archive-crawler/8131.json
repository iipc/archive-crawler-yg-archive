In &quot;packages.html&quot; inside the main packa=\r\nge where\n&gt; &gt; Heritrix.java is located it talks about a couple things like &quot;=\r\nadmin&quot;\n&gt; &gt; which should be located at: {@link org.archive.crawler.admin\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n org.archive.crawler.admin}, which is nowhere to be found, as well as\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe datamodel which is located at:{@link\n&gt; &gt; org.archive.crawler.datamodel o=\r\nrg.archive.crawler.datamodel}. I have\n&gt; &gt; the datamodel package, but it onl=\r\ny contains one java file for\n&gt; &gt; UriUniqFilter.java, when the documentation=\r\n says it is also supposed\n&gt; &gt; to contain files such as CandidateURI and Cra=\r\nwlURI, which are both\n&gt; &gt; essential. The crawler works, so assume they are =\r\nat least somewhere.\n&gt; &gt; Is this just bad documentation? Or are some of thes=\r\ne files gone?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On a different note, I would also like to find the fi=\r\nles for the Web\n&gt; &gt; UI itself. I assume they are JSP files or Servlets. Cou=\r\nld someone\n&gt; &gt; point me to what package, or folder they might be located in=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!
