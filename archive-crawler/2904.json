That might explain a whole lot of URLs being\n&gt; discarded very quickly towards the end of the crawl and hence an\n&gt; &#39;abrupt&#39; end to the crawl..I guess. Do you think that&#39;s possible?\n\nMaybe, but: the decide-rules are applied even before URLs are \nscheduled, so I wouldn&#39;t expect to see a low percent-complete \nnumber (high &#39;queued&#39; URL count) that&#39;s quickly changed by the \nhops-count rule to end the crawl. (Only if you changed the scope \nrules mid-crawl would once-scheduled URLs then be rejected.)\n\nIf you set global crawl limits (&#39;max-bytes-download&#39;, \n&#39;max-document-download&#39;, &#39;max-time-sec&#39;), that&#39;s checked separate \nfrom URL scheduling -- so it could cause a crawl to end abruptly \neven while many URLs were waiting.\n\nIn no case, though, should the UI show a job as &#39;finished&#39; and the \nlogs/reports still show progress on multiple checks.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
