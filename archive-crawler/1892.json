Actualy I&#39;m searching a\n&gt; alternative methode for org.archive.crawler.datamodel.CrawlUri &quot;public\n&gt; void addLinkToCollection(String link, String collectionName)&quot;.\n\nJust before the 1.4.0 release, the Link class was introduced.  See \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/index.html.  Notice how Link attempts \nencapsulation of all to do w/ Link.  See how it references page it was \nfound in, what the actual link URL is, its &#39;type&#39; and &#39;context&#39;, etc.\n\nRather than carry extracted links as Strings in the CrawlURI, with each \nlink type carried in its own &#39;collection&#39;, now CrawlURI carries a single \ncollection of Link objects. The CrawlURI API was changed accordingly. \nSee from about \nhttp://crawler.archive.org/xref/org/archive/crawler/datamodel/CrawlURI.html#1080 \non for the new versions of old link-adding methods. Alternatives to \naddLinkToCollection are the methods addOutlink, createAndAddLink, etc.\n\nStudy ExtractorHTML#processLink, how its called, for how to add Links to \na CrawlURI.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Second question: what happend to the CoreAttributeConstants\n&gt; A_CSS_LINKS, A_HTML_EMBEDS, A_HTML_LINKS, A_HTML_SPECULATIVE_EMBEDS,\n&gt; A_HTTP_HEADER_URIS and A_JS_FILE_LINKS ? any alternatives?\n\nThese are no longer needed now all links are stored in a single \ncollection inside CrawlURI.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Third question: In Class CrawlURI the Methode\n&gt; public Link getPrerequisiteUri() {\n&gt;         return (Link) getObject(A_PREREQUISITE_URI);\n&gt;     }\n&gt; returns a Link. How can I get the prerequisitURI from this Linkobject?\n&gt; By using the Methode Link.getDestination() or Link.getSource() ?\n\nSource is where the link was found.  Destination is the actual Link URL.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for all this questions, but I have to update not selfe written\n&gt; code, not that funny :) ... (a specialised webcrawler for\n&gt; www.geometa.info)\n\nNo problem.  Keep asking questions.\n\nSt.Ack\nP.S. Any chance you&#39;d want to write a sentence on how/what geometa is \nusing Heritrix for and I&#39;ll add it to our list of Heritrix users out on \nthe FAQ?  You can send it to me off the list.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks for your help, Adrian\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; *Yahoo!
