No conversion is done on \nthe raw downloads.  This is intentional.  We&#39;re trying &#39;archive&#39; exactly \nwhat we read from the servers.\n\nLater when processors run, they want to do various analysis against the \ndownloaded content:  e.g. the ExtractorHTML will try and pull links out \nof HTML pages.  Dependent on the processor, they&#39;ll want to look at the \ndownload as characters rather than as raw bytes. For example, they may \nwant to regex over a character stream to find links.  At this time, \nwe&#39;ll provide a charset to the character reader so it does appropriate \ntranslation of raw bytes.  Regards the charset, Heritrix is a little \nlame.  We just use the charset from the HTTP Response headers.  If none, \nwe default to ISO-8859-1.  The charset on the HTTP Response is very \noften wrong so when processors go to read, they&#39;ll be reading mangled \ncharacters.\n\nWe have an RFE to add a charset guesser to the processing stream: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=899909&group_id=73833&atid=539102.\n\nIs this what you were thinking?\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\nthiru_sundaram wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt; I am new to using heritrix. The manual says that the heritrix supports\n&gt; only ISO format. Anybody has worked on making heritrix to follow utf-8\n&gt; charset? I am not able to figure out where to do the required change.\n&gt; Please give me suggestions on how to work on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Thanks in Advance\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
