Now I have\n&gt; updated to Heritrix 1.4 (with JDK 1.4) and get the following error\n&gt; message: &quot;name is not a valid java type (or is a reserved word):\n&gt; settings-directory&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If I use JDK 1.5 everything works fine - but for a costumer I need to\n&gt; use JDK 1.4.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I took a look at the MANIFEST in the JAR file of Heritrix I saw\n&gt; that it was compiled with JDK 1.5. So I rebuild Heritrix from the\n&gt; sources with JDK 1.4.\n&gt; \n&gt; But still the above described error happens as before.\n\nYou get this message trying to compile the application that integrates\nHeritrix? Are you setting the javac &#39;-target&#39; to be 1.4? See here for\ndiscussion of &#39;-target&#39; on javac:\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javac.html\n(Search for &#39;target&#39;).  If your build system is ant, see the\ndiscussion under the &#39;target&#39; task on this page:\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/javac.html (Again\nsearch for target).\n\nThe Heritrix jar itself should need no modification to run in a 1.4\nJVM.  That&#39;s our own target JVM version.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
