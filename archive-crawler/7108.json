However, I could not find any information on how t=\r\no use them. Could you please explain in more detail (or point me to the doc=\r\numentation) how to assign priorities to different queues while running a jo=\r\nb and how to assign priorities to URIs when they are inserted into the queu=\r\nes.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n&gt; If you want your prioritization to also take ef=\r\nfect within the standard \n&gt; Heritrix frontier queues, there&#39;s a (seldom-use=\r\nd) pair of features, \n&gt; queue and URI &#39;precedence&#39; values, which affect (1)=\r\n how inactive queues \n&gt; are sorted while waiting for their chance to be act=\r\nive; (2) where URIs \n&gt; are inserted into individual queues (if all the othe=\r\nr factors which \n&gt; affect whether they are pushed-near-the-top or queued-to=\r\n-the-back are \n&gt; equal).\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
