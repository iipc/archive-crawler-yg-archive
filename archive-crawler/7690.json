Otherwise you can get a reputation as \nan irresponsible/pest crawling project (and taint Heritrix with that \nreputation as well). You might also accumulate more draconian total \nblocks from webmasters.\n\nRegarding your BdbModule error, without more context, it&#39;s hard to tell \nwhat&#39;s happening.\n\nThere shouldn&#39;t be any such (java call stack) lines in the Response Code \nReport.\n\nA problem around BdbModule.openDatabase might indicate a difficulty with \ndisk operations at the &#39;state&#39; path -- if you have made any changes to \nBdbModule configuration, or are running your job on any sort of \nnon-local or less-common filesystem, those would be factors to consider. \n(I don&#39;t think BDB-JE runs well over NFS, for example.)\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 5/4/12 11:29 PM, flemingkr wrote:\n&gt; Actually I think I got all that sorted now, and was able to launch using a web site that indeed has my contact info in it.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I&#39;m now back, finally, to this error:\n&gt;\n&gt; java.lang.IllegalStateException: BdbModule not started\n&gt;\n&gt; In the Response Code report, the two lines immediately below (preceeding) that message are:\n&gt;\n&gt; \tat org.archive.bdb.BdbModule.openDatabase(BdbModule.java:328)\n&gt; \tat org.archive.bdb.BdbModule.getStoredMap(BdbModule.java:652)\n&gt;\n&gt; This is actually the error that led me to try specifying the seed URLs in a file in the first place. So, I&#39;m sort of back to square one, as they say.\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, that&#39;s again for the patience and assistance.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, &quot;flemingkr&quot;&lt;kirkrfleming@...&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Gordon thank you so much for your patience. Commenting out the section you referred to allowed me to build error-free, although I&#39;m now facing a warning regarding the user contact URL, which is rejected.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; While I think I understand the purpose of this URL, I don&#39;t quite understand how to specify one. I do have 2 or 3 registered domains, but I do not have a site hosted at this time. But, even if I did, I don&#39;t find anything that tells me if there is a specified or expected format for the contact information that supposed to be located at the site. Is this documented or just brain-dead obvious to those with reasonable intelligence :) ?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Gordon Mohr&lt;gojomo@&gt;  wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; You probably still have the example override for &#39;seeds.textSource.value&#39; in the example &#39;longerOverrides&#39; bean - this tries to reach into a bean named &#39;seeds&#39;, property &#39;textSource&#39;, property &#39;value&#39;. That now doesn&#39;t exist in your alternate, file-based seeds configuration. Eliminate the now unnecessary override and the erre should go away.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
