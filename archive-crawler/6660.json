Wh=\r\nen the p:// urls came up they lowered the budget again as they did not matc=\r\nh the association. (Perhaps the SurtAuthorityQueueAssignmentPolicy should h=\r\nang on to the protocol part in the queue name?)\n\nThis issue has also got me=\r\n wondering if it would be possible to have such associations that applied t=\r\no all protocols? Indeed, it would seem more logical to me for that to be th=\r\ne norm.\n\n- Kris\n\n\n"}}
