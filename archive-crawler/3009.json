I did not see your subsequent posting to the list where you \ntalk about entity encodings and ExtractorHTML.\n\nSo, yeah, the ExtractorHTML should probably do an entity decoding on any \nlinks found in a page.   We should probably do it here rather than as \npart of the general fixup code we apply to every URL found because this \nseems to be how browsers work (If you get info for a page, it lists page \nlinks with the entity encoding undone.  If you put an entity encoding \ninto the location bar, it makes request without undoing entity \nencoding).  I made an issue here: \nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1517693&group_id=73833&atid=539099\n\n(FYI: You can see the links that Heritrix finds in a page by running the \n$HERITRIX_HOME/bin/htmlextractor tool.  Pass it URL of page).\n\nThanks,\nSt.Ack\n\n\nWill Sargent wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Michael Stack wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The link-to-crawl looks like \n&gt; &quot;http://foo.org/testing/person%27s-stuff \n&gt; &lt;http://foo.org/testing/person%27s-stuff&gt;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; in the hosting page?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This should just pass through Heritrix untouched and result in a \n&gt; request\n&gt; &gt; out to http://foo.org/testing/person%27s-stuff \n&gt; &lt;http://foo.org/testing/person%27s-stuff&gt; (I haven&#39;t tried it.
