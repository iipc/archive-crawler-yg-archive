If the crawler\n&gt; &gt; is stuck in a crawler trap or if I just want to see what is left in\n&gt; &gt; the crawl frontier, can I launch the WUI to check on the status in the\n&gt; &gt; middle of the crawl?\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry for any misunderstanding.

It points to a \nsimple tool we wrote that talks to remote Heritrix instances by \nlaunching a JVM to send JMX queries.  Because the command-line tool \nlives only for the life of the sending of the JMX message and receipt of \nresponse from the crawler, it won&#39;t be around to catch the notifications \nemitted by Heritrix at key points during the life of a crawl.  You could \nuse the little command-line tool to poll on a period asking &#39;are you \nfinished yet?&#39; (Or write code to register for notifications and then act \non the events you are interested in).\n\nRegards the WUI, its either on or off.  We&#39;ve not added tools to \nenable/disable the WUIR midcrawl.  Why not launch with it enabled?  Or \nyou could also use the aforementioned command-line tool to get text \nversions of the reports the WUI exposes on state of frontier, etc., and \nperhaps go without the WUI altogether... though I wouldn&#39;t recommend it \nuntil you&#39;d first established familiarity with running crawls in \nHeritrix.  The command-line output might in places assume previous \nfamiliarity with the WUI presentation.\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
