It failed (but it works for \nother .arc files that I get from the Internet). Is there any steps \ni didn&#39;t do that cause this problem? \n\nis there any other ready tool that i can use to unpack the whole ARC \nfile without specifying the offset number for each data in the ARC \nfile?\n\nI thought all ARC files have the same format. Am I right?\n(But seems like the ARC files generated by Heritrix is different than \nothers.)\n\nThank you! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
