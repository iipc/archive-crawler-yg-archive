Then, if (for example) using 5 queues, 5 requests \ncan be in process in parallel, resulting in up to 5X faster crawling.\n\nThe relevant setting is &#39;parallelQueues&#39; on the QueueAssignmentPolicy. \nSee some notes here:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/H3+Dev+Notes+for+Crawl+Operators#H3DevNotesforCrawlOperators-QueueAssignmentPolicies:%27parallelQueues%27and%27deferToPrevious%27settings\n\nAs it&#39;s usually the case that you want most sites to be crawled in the \nnormal polite manner, even when there are one or more sites that can be \ncrawled more aggressively, it often makes sense to only set a higher \n&#39;parallelQueues&#39; value in a &quot;sheet override&quot; to affect some subset of \nsites. Thus, that&#39;s one of the example overridden settings in the sheets \nexample at:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Sheets\n\n- Gordon\n\nOn 8/24/14, 5:14 AM, &#39;Markus.Mirsberger&#39; markus.mirsberger@... \n[archive-crawler] wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; are there any ways to speed up an active crawl?\n&gt; I am always crawling only one single domain and I was told by the owner\n&gt; that it is ok when I crawl it with up to 10Url/sec.
