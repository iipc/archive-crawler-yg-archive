I&#39;ll take a look soon.\n\nI&#39;ll also use this as a chance to remind people that they can vote for \nbugs they&#39;d like fixed via the JIRA issue tracker for Heritrix:\n\nhttp://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:popularissues-panel\n\nPart of issue triage leading up to any release is reviewing the popular \nissues, in case there are things we haven&#39;t prioritized internally that \nare still important to the wider community.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n"}}
