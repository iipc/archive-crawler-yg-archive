And I roughly measured \nthe time to read the stream, it takes about 50s, so time-out occurs.\n\nI copy Heritrix to my PC at home, it access internet via adsl \nwithout proxy. It runs smoothly, no time-out occurs (sotimeout=20s).\n\ntoday, I did another test, replacing \n&quot;rec.getRecordedInput().readFullyOrUntil(..);&quot; in FetchHTTP.java\nwith\n&quot;byte[] responseBody = method.getResponseBody();\n System.out.println(new String(responseBody));&quot;\n\nthe updated sentences execute without time-out (sotimeout=20s). \n\nThe new sentences will also read content from stream as the previous \nsentence, but it runs smoothly.  So, I think the problem I met, is \npartly related to my working environment(network or software \nsetting?), and partly to Heritrix.\n\nCould you give me some suggestions to fix this problem.\n\nthx \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
