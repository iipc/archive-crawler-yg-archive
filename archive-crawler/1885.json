This way, too, non-technical pe=\r\nople can \ncomprehend that a 250GB drive will actually store 250GB of\ncrawl =\r\ncontent.

I&#39;d be happy to fix this if =\r\nwe could\n&gt;&gt;&gt; agree\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on exactly how things are supposed to be. My suggest=\r\nion: show four\n&gt;&gt;&gt; characters. So we&#39;d go from 4095 MB to 4GB and then 4.00=\r\n1GB etc. when\n&gt;&gt;&gt; we hit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 40GB we go to 40.01 etc. same for the move fro=\r\nm B to KB and KB to MB\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Additionally, we could have a mouse-over po=\r\np up the exact number of \n&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;My preference:\n&gt;&gt;  - always at le=\r\nast 3 significant figures, up to 4 when significand is \n&gt;&gt; an integer\n&gt;&gt;  -=\r\n use largest unit that results in a leading digit &gt;=3D 1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Examples:\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;  4.23K\n&gt;&gt;  1023K\n&gt;&gt;  1.00M\n&gt;&gt;  57.3M\n&gt;&gt;  789M\n&gt;&gt;  1001M\n&gt;&gt;  1.10G\n&gt;&gt;  27=\r\n.2G\n&gt;&gt;  989G\n&gt;&gt;  1019G\n&gt;&gt;  1.27P\n&gt;&gt;  etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; Fine with me. I&#39;ll take a l=\r\nook at this.\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We should either be pedantic and use &#39;KiB&#39;, &#39;MiB&#39;, &#39;Gi=\r\nB&#39;, &#39;PiB&#39; -- or \n&gt;&gt;We strategically\n&gt;&gt;vague like Gnu tools and use just &#39;K&#39;=\r\n, &#39;M&#39;, &#39;G&#39;, &#39;P&#39;. \n&gt; \n&gt; We&#39;ve adhered to B meaning bytes (as in 1024 is a ba=\r\nse unit) and b \n&gt; means bits (with 1000 as a base unit). So 1 KB is 1024 B =\r\netc. I don&#39;t \n&gt; see any reason to change this. But if adding an &#39;i&#39; makes p=\r\neople more \n&gt; comfortable, I don&#39;t have a problem with it. My concern is th=\r\nat the KiB \n&gt; notation is not all that commonly used and may be confusing.\n=\r\n \n\n\n"}}
