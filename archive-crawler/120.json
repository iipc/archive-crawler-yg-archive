My best guess was\nthat it was caused by http/1.1 kept-alive connections that\nthe other side was closing. (The comment near the HTTPClient\ncode that generates that error indicates the usual cause\nis a closed connection.)\n\nOur HTTP fetcher was changed to limit itself to http/1.0,\nand I didn&#39;t see the errors on subsequent test crawls.\n\nIf it&#39;s returned, there must be another trigger of the\nproblem.\n\n- Gordon\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Igor Ranitovic&quot; &lt;igor@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, July 23, 2003 1:16 PM\nSubject: [archive-crawler] httpclient bug\n\n\n&gt; Looking through the logs of Heritrix triple-crawl crawl I found a lot\n&gt; of HttpClient errors:\n&gt; WARNING: org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpRecoverableException:\n&gt; org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpRecoverableException: Error in parsing\n&gt;  the status  line from the response: unable to find line starting with\n&gt; &quot;HTTP/&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I lookup for some pointers at the Commons-HttpClient mailing list and it\n&gt; seems that is a bug in httpclient.\n&gt; See:\n&gt; http://archives.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listId=128&msgNo=2594\n&gt;\n&gt; For www.bnf.fr site this happens in 1 out of 3 fetch attempts.\n&gt;\n&gt; i.\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S.
