This crawl is still running,\n&gt; having retrieved about 19,000 documents and counting. \n&gt; \n&gt; It seems to be going slower than would have been expected,\n&gt; although it is clearly politeness, not CPU, bound. The\n&gt; cause might be that it was running concurrently on crawl09\n&gt; with the other crawl (see below). \n&gt; \n&gt; How many did HTTrack and Mercator get, again? If we&#39;re already\n&gt; past their yields, we could stop the crawler and begin analysis;\n&gt; if not, we could give Heritrix a bit more time; it still has \n&gt; a backlog of ~10,000 URIs and seems to have discovered about 5,000\n&gt; more in its last 1,000 visited.\n&gt; \n&gt; The data is collecting in crawl09:/0/crawls/test-gojomo/loc-crawl\n&gt; \n&gt; --\n&gt; The second was of the 9hosts. It seems to have had its work queues\n&gt; quickly dominated by junk URIs -- some combo of a weakness in\n&gt; the new extraction and endlessly-deep server error pages. So,\n&gt; over 115,000 URIs retrieved, over 80,000 were 4xx errors of\n&gt; various sorts. From its last status dump to stdout:\n&gt; \n&gt; Status Code Distribution:\n&gt;         301     33\n&gt;         200     23337\n&gt;         403     53642\n&gt;         204     1\n&gt;         500     289\n&gt;         414     12781\n&gt;         303     1\n&gt;         404     21388\n&gt;         400     102\n&gt;         300     1\n&gt;         1       580\n&gt;         302     1557\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve stopped it, I&#39;m going to see if I can discover what caused it to\n&gt; go awry, and rerun it when possible. It would help to have another set\n&gt; of eyes on the problems -- esp. the strange &quot;.replace(/)&quot; URIs affecting\n&gt; multiple hosts -- so please take a look at the output to see if you\n&gt; can figure out when/why things went wrong. The data is at:\n&gt; \n&gt;   crawl09:/0/crawls/test-gojomo/heri9host/\n&gt; \n&gt; I can be reached by mail or YM while online here.\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\n&gt; archive-crawler-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
