I&#39;m delighted to get such helpful=\r\n feedback, especially concerning the preprocessor PreconditionEnforcer.  I =\r\nmust admit that I had totally failed to report that all this started when I=\r\n did my initial crawls using all defaults (except the user-agent and from f=\r\nields, which I set legally and appropriately.)  I just repeated this origin=\r\nal all-default crawl (with seed http://www.cs.nmt.edu), and saw it run to c=\r\nompletion in 52 ms.  It SEEMED an identical failure.\n\nNow I&#39;m not completel=\r\ny sure where to find what relevant data, but once again 0 sites were visite=\r\nd & 0 downloaded.  I started with the crawl-manifest and found a good list =\r\nof all crawl activities.  The crawl.log was empty, the runtime-errors.log w=\r\nas empty, the local-errors log was empty, the uri-errors.log was empty, the=\r\n progress-statics log showed 0 discovered, 0 queued, 0 downloaded, a doc/s =\r\nof 0(0), a KB/s (ag) of 0(0), dl-failures =3D 0, busy-thread =3D 0, mem-use=\r\n-KB =3D 14571, heap-size-KB =3D 23632, congestion =3D &#65533;, max-depth =\r\n=3D -1, & avg-depth =3D 0.\n\nThe file order.xml looked fine to me, seeds.txt=\r\n said &quot;http:/www.cs.nmt.edu&quot;, host-report.txt was empty, mimetype-report.tx=\r\nt was empty, responsecode-report.txt was empty, seeds-report.txt was empty.=\r\n   Crawl-report.txt showed the crawl finished in 52 ms., &quot;Total Seeds Crawl=\r\ned: 0&quot;, &quot;Total Seeds not Crawled: 0&quot;, &quot;Total Hosts Crawled: -1&quot;, &quot;Total Doc=\r\numents Crawled: 0&quot;, and all other statistics were 0.\n\nI am only a newbie he=\r\nre, but to me this says:  &quot;Something didn&#39;t work somewhere for some reason.=\r\n&quot;  I was unable to find any other information of interest, and I&#39;m hoping f=\r\nor some clarification here.\n\nAll my environment remains the same as before.=\r\n  Thanks for any suggestions.\n\n-Rich B.\n\n\n"}}
