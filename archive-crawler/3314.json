You can also have CrawlURIs inherit properties from \ntheir parent CrawlURI.\n\nUse these setters to add to CrawlURI:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/datamodel/CandidateURI.html#putString(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)\n\n(And the variants, putLong, putString, etc.)\n\nFor items you want to persist across processing runs, add a key to this \nlist:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/datamodel/CrawlURI.html#addAlistPersistentMember(java.lang.Object)\n\nSee processors such as ChangeEvaluator for example usage.\n\nFor key/values you want inherited as you crawl, add key using:\n\nhttp://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/datamodel/CandidateURI.html#makeHeritable(java.lang.String)\n\nSounds like their usage is not plain.  Let us know how we can improve \nthe API or, what we should add to facilitate your use case.\n\nDoes Processor#initialTasks and Processor#finalTasks work for job scope? \n\nThere is no means for persisting objects across crawl jobs at the \nmoment, unless you subclass Heritrix (I&#39;ve added an RFE).\n\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I actually need to split a processor which does too much stuff, in\n&gt; several processors in several chains, but still share some things\n&gt; among them like database connections, etc.\n&gt; I can do this by a static field, but I would like to have affinity to\n&gt; the job and not interfere with other heretrix instance.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also I may need to attach on some CrawlURIs specific flags for the\n&gt; other processors, I saw in the API the annotations, but I&#39;m not sure\n&gt; how to use them and how not to interfere with other things.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; -- \n&gt; Laurian Gridinoc, purl.org/net/laur\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
