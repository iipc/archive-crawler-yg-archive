How many excludes do you \nhave? Hundreds, thousands or more?\ni.\n\nJohn Lekashman wrote:\n&gt; Hi there,\n&gt; I&#39;ve been doing crawls with heritrix for some time, and running into\n&gt; a new form of irritation.\n&gt; \n&gt; A variety of universities are creating online indexes with systems\n&gt; that have no name, only an IP address.  It appears to be some form\n&gt; of security through obscurity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Through some clever means of course, the crawler finds them.\n&gt; Then, it ratholes there for quite some time.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, I can probably put something of the form:\n&gt; +http://(1,1,1,10,\n&gt; in a do not crawl surt list, but is there a better way?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have some concerns about growing the do-not-crawl .surt space,\n&gt; I don&#39;t think its designed for thousands of entries.  (Perhaps this\n&gt; is a suggestion for further work.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I could also chop them off at a firewall below the crawler, but again,\n&gt; wondering if anyone considers a better way?\n&gt; \n&gt; Currently at 1.8, since I started the current crawl just as 1.10 \n&gt; was coming out, and didn&#39;t have time for QA on that.  If there is\n&gt; new docs - fixed in 1.10, and I didn&#39;t see it, ignoring this is\n&gt; fine, telling me would be great.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; John\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
