I got to know\na lot about heritrix after reading some of the mails here and am glad\nto see that people here are willing to help others.\n\nI have couple of questions and it would be wonderful if any of the\nHeritrix experts here can help me out. \n\na. From what I have assimilated about Heritrix it seems that it does\nnot have any option for doing a Focused crawl yet. Till now I was\nusing iVia focused crawler but I want to know if I can do the same\nwith Heritrix.\n\nb. Is there any way I can hook up a classifier like Bow with Heritrix\nand hence run a simple focused crawl?  By running a focused crawl I\nmean (something of the sort of) taking into consideration the\njudgement of a trained classifier before adding any URL to Frontier.\n\nPlease let me know if anyone of you have used Heritrix to run a\nfocused crawl and how you did it. \n\nthanks in advance,\n\nSaurabh\n\n\n\n\n"}}
