Sounds like it s=\r\nhould work. You might doublecheck that \n&gt; the compiled class files should b=\r\ne in the classpath, the correct \n&gt; Processor.options is used by the running=\r\n heritrix, and your processors \n&gt; extend the right superclass (e.g. Extract=\r\nor). One thing you could try is \n&gt; configuring them manually in order.xml a=\r\nnd see if it works.\n&gt; \n&gt; Noah\n&gt; \n&gt; On 04/21/2012 02:26 AM, David P. Gross w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Team,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have several custom extractors that are n=\r\not showing up in Heritrix \n&gt; &gt; after rebuild.  I double checked to make sur=\r\ne everything is in the \n&gt; &gt; right place -- .java files in \n&gt; &gt; ~/heritrix/s=\r\nrc/java/org/archive/crawler/extractor folder, \n&gt; &gt; Processor.options in the=\r\n ~/heritrix/src/conf/modules, and profiles \n&gt; &gt; directory in ~/heritrix/src=\r\n/conf.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I get no errors but they are not included in the extractor s=\r\nelection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What did I miss?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; David=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
