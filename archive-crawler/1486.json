It \nseems to be a problem with the nowui mode not using the order.xml file \nthat I specified.  To test this I added some junk code to the order.xml \nfile that would cause it not to validate (changed a tag name).  The WUI \ncaught the error.  The nowui mode did not.  Im guessing the nowui mode \nis using an order.xml file other than the one I specified.\n\nRich Collins\nDirector of Information Technology\nInjuryBoard.com\n813-225-1313 x228\nrcollins@...\n\n\n\nKristinn Sigurdsson wrote:\n\n&gt; I belive that the WUI prints a red star next to the setting if it is \n&gt; invalid.
