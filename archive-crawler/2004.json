Every rule gets a chance to pass or have its say, and\nthe last rule to give a decision wins.\n\n&gt; If I understand correctly, the DecideRuleSequence class currently iterates \n&gt; over all DecideRules and adjusts the overall decision to the current \n&gt; DecideRule&#39;s decision whenever that one is not &quot;PASS&quot;. The problem is that \n&gt; one really must carefully consider where to put a decide rule.\n\nThis is somewhat by design; careful choice of ordering was meant to\nallow control over which rules trump/subset others.\n\n&gt; For example, adding a PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule at the end of the sequence \n&gt; will always result in ACCEPT for any prerequisite document, even if that \n&gt; prerequisite&#39;s URI has been declared out of scope by upstream decide rules.\n\nUsually, this is what&#39;s wanted -- since the mere fact that a\n&#39;prerequisite&#39; has been discovered implies that it&#39;s needed\nbefore fetching an otherwise in-scope URI. But, for novel\nsituations, a PrerequisiteAcceptDecideRule could be placed\nearlier, or special overide-all exclude rules could be placed\nafter it.\n\n&gt; Wouldn&#39;t it make sense to offer the administrator some more control over these \n&gt; rules by adding something like an ANDDecideRuleSequence (returns REJECT as \n&gt; soon as it gets a REJECT) and an ORDecideRuleSequence (returns ACCEPT as soon \n&gt; as it gets an ACCEPT)?\n\nYes, and similarly, we&#39;d also kicked around the idea that rules could\ninclude a &#39;and stop all further processing&#39; option, which skips all\nsubsequent rules (making the current decision final).\n\nI don&#39;t know if &#39;AND&#39; and &#39;OR&#39; would be the best names for the\nsequence rules you describe, since the ACCEPT/REJECT/PASS logic\nisn&#39;t strictly binary. RejectIfAny or AcceptIfAny could be\nclearer. (You could also imagine a MajorityRules rule.)\n\nHowever, we decided to put off such intricate rules, or any\nconcept of branching, until there was more experience with the\nbasic system and better confidence that the extra complexity\nwas needed. We haven&#39;t yet encountered a situation that can&#39;t\nbe handled with careful ordering of existing rules.\n\nIf you wanted to contribute such rules, it would be good to\naccompany them with a practical example of a situation that\nrequires them.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n"}}
