Pre=\r\nviously at BnF we used standalone Heritrix instances, and would use documen=\r\nt count budget, configuring the following frontier properties :\n\n- queue-to=\r\ntal-budget\n- error-penalty-amount\n- balance-replenish-amount\n\nIn NetArchive=\r\nSuite we need to use the Quota enforcer, because the annotations it adds to=\r\n the crawl log allow to perform post-crawl anlysis. \n\nTo set a budget in do=\r\ncument count, we set the group-max-fetch-successes property of the Quota En=\r\nforcer, which works fine. However we noticed that some jobs are taking a ve=\r\nry long time to complete, especially when we have to retry many times for d=\r\nead sites, DNS request that fail to complete are not penalized... Is there =\r\na means to use an error penalty mechanism with the Quota enforcer ?\n\nWhere =\r\ncan I find some documentation regarding the QUota enforcer configuration?\n\n=\r\nBest wishes,\n\nNicolas\n\n\n"}}
