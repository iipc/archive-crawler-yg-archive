(Heritrix 1.4 was released in April \n2005.)\n\nHeritrix 1.x has some mechanisms to try to limit the creation of URIs to \nonly supported URI-schemes, so you might be running into that. Check all \nthe logs (especially uri-errors.log) for evidence your URIs might be \ndiscarded as illegal, and take a look in the source code at the \nUURIFactory &#39;schemes&#39; and &#39;ignoredSchemes&#39; fields, and how they may be \ninitialized from properties, for a place you may need to add your new \nscheme.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nOn 9/13/10 10:42 AM, Tomas Ukkonen wrote:\n&gt; Hi\n&gt;\n&gt; After programming my second custom fetcher module for fetching local files\n&gt; I ran into a following (simple?) problem I cannot fix:\n&gt;\n&gt; Heritrix keep ignoring my custom &quot;localfile:/etc/issue&quot; formatted seeds:\n&gt;\n&gt; * it seems my fetcher plugin for Heritrix 1.4 never even sees the seeds\n&gt; * I have edited heritrix.properties and added &quot;localfile&quot; as a supported\n&gt; protocol\n&gt; * I have removed PreconditionEnforcer etc. modules and using DecidingScope\n&gt; with\n&gt;    only one AcceptDecideRule\n&gt; * My WHOIS-fetcher plugin seems to work ok with almost same settings.\n&gt; * I&#39;m using Heritrix v1.4.1\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Any suggestions?
