But when i am using the arcreader \n&gt; provided with the heritrix &quot;/bin/arcreader&quot; with the command  \n&gt; $bin/arcreader -f gzipdump &lt;path to arc file&gt; \n&gt; it&#39;s not doing anything, except that, initially it displays some sensible \n&gt; charactor later on it starts displaying non- sensible characters. I also tried \n&gt; some other software for extracting arc file. for eg: ark, etc. etc. \n&gt; But they all show error message &quot;unknown archive format or corrupted \n&gt; archive&quot; \n&gt;  \n&gt; And when i type  \n&gt; $arc -e IAH-20051212122925-00000-myhost.mydomain.arc \n&gt;  \n&gt; it gives the error message \n&gt;  \n&gt; An entry in IAH-20051212122925-00000-myhost.mydomain.arc has a \n&gt; bad header. \n&gt; hdrver: 66 \n&gt;   37209 bytes skipped. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Can anybody tell me what should i do?? :-( \n\nWithout seeing the arc file in question, there is little we can say.\n\n&gt; While Dealing with the arc format some queries came in to my mind.  \n&gt; 1. What is the advantage of arc file format?? \n\nIt scales very well and is easy to understand and implement.  It does\nnot handle changing data, though.\n\n&gt; 3. Can more than one threads read the records from the same arc file at \n&gt; the same time. \n\nIf the reader program is written correctly, yes.  The arc format says\nnothing about the readers at all.\n\n&gt; 4. What could be the maximum size of an arc file. \n\nThe ARC format defines no limit, but your filesystem and/or programs\nmay.  Typically we aim for either 100MB or 500MB to make sure the\nfilesystem is happy.\n\n&gt; 5. How can i write my own arc reader that reads the various documents \n&gt; from the arc file. \n\nRead http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php (note that\nversion 2 is not used).\n\n&gt; 6. What kind of format does the arc file stores. \n\nAny, but that doesn&#39;t mean that you can understand the contents.\n\n-Lars\n\n\n"}}
