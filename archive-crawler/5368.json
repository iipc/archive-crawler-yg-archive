The server ca=\r\nme up \nOK but I do not see the default profiles in the web console. I have =\r\n\nthe jobs directory as \n\n%Heritrix_HOME%&#92;conf&#92;jobs&#92;profile-basic_seed_sites=\r\n\n%Heritrix_HOME%&#92;conf&#92;jobs&#92;profile-broad_but_shallow\n\nThe web console does =\r\nnot show the profile and here is the output.\n\nActive Jobs:\nThere are no act=\r\nive jobs on HOSTNAME:8849#21185076. \nReady Jobs:\nThere are no ready jobs on=\r\n HOSTNAME:8849#21185076. \nProfiles:\nCompleted Jobs:\nThere are no completed =\r\njobs. \n\nI digg through this group and other places and noticed profile has =\r\nto \nexist and it does exist. I thought it was looking for profiles \ndirecto=\r\nry and I created a directory called profiles and copied the \ncontent that e=\r\nxist in jobs above. Still the same issue.\n\n%Heritrix_HOME%&#92;conf&#92;profiles&#92;pr=\r\nofile-basic_seed_sites\n%Heritrix_HOME%&#92;conf&#92;profiles&#92;profile-broad_but_shal=\r\nlow\n\nDo I need to modify anything to the files manually that exist in JOBS =\r\n\ndirectory? Please clarify. \n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n"}}
