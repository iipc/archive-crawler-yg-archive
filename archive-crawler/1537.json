Most of \nthe time I had wget automagically rewrite the URLs in the documents so that \nthey would all link to each other and could be served in a simple and &quot;user \nfriendly&quot; manner from any machine they were written on.  (among other \nparameters that&#39;s -E -K -k)   Originally I thought I would just insert a \nprocess in front of the write processors in heritrix to rewrite the \nURLs.   But right now I dont think that is the best long term idea.  To do \nit correctly in today&#39;s world, not just html (and the script in them) but \nPDF, PS, DOC, SWF etc files should be modified.  Next year yet another \ncomplex file format will probably drop onto the web.\n\nSo I&#39;m thinking about writing a simple proxy server that would look at a \nURL and decide whether to return a document from local storage or to fetch \nit from the web.  On the first pass I&#39;ll just look at a directory structure \nthat could be build by MirrorWriter.   Once the general idea is proven to \nwork it could be modified to work with ARC files and some kind of \ndatabase.  I figure on a subsequent pass I&#39;d modify it so that if the local \nstorage has multiple versions of a file the user would be presented with a \nlist of them and s/he could pick the right one.  This idea is not \nperfect.  the biggest hole that immediately comes to mind is that anything \nthat is likely to be an embed should probably just default to the most \nrecent and that may not be correct.  (sorta like a limited version of the \nwayback machine, but I&#39;m expecting this to be just a few pages \nlong)  Anyway, as I said, it wont be perfect, but should be usable.\n\nIf I was doing this for just myself I&#39;d probably write it in \nperl.  However, if there is general interest in it, I could use C or \njava.  I assume that anyone running heritrix has to have a current java \nenvironment in place and may not have a current perl installed.\n\nAny comments?\n\n\nDave Skinner   dave at solid dot net\n    High Performance Programming---assembly (lots of them), C, java, perl\n    Database and Non-trivial web site implementations\n    Real-time and embedded systems are my specialty\n\n\n\n"}}
