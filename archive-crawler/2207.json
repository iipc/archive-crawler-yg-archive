Unfortunately, I don&#39;t thin=\r\nk there is such a Frontier class at this time.  \n\nGordon Paynter (i.e. the =\r\nother Gordon; not to be confused with the Gordon who knows what he is talki=\r\nng about).\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; prasenjitm@... 09/14/05 7:58 p.m. &gt;&gt;&gt;\nThanks Gordon, a=\r\nnd really appreciate your quick response.\n\nOn a followup query, I have a si=\r\ntuation where I want to crawl a single \n(local)site in the intranet, and re=\r\nally want to relax the politeness \npolicy on my sedded local-site.\n\nWe have=\r\n tried it out by setting some of the politeness related \nconfiguration sett=\r\nings, but of no avail :( After some time, there is \nonly one thread running=\r\n.  Is it possible to have a greater throughput by \ninstructing heritrix to =\r\nignore its default politeness policy and be more \naggressive(rather rude), =\r\nwhere we can have more than one thread crawling \nthe same site.\n\nthanks,\nPr=\r\nasen\n\nGordon Mohr (@Internet Archive) wrote on 9/14/2005, 11:23 AM:\n\n &gt; Pra=\r\nsenjit wrote:\n &gt; &gt;  From what I understand, if I use SURTPrefix and just pr=\r\novide a single\n &gt; &gt; seed, it should crawl only those URIs which are residin=\r\ng on the seeded\n &gt; &gt; host.
