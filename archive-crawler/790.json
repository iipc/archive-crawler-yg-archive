You \nmust set the system property heritrix.development as in \n&#39;-Dheritrix.development&#39; so heritrix looks for webapps in their \ndevelopment locations.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to write a  xxxWriterProcessor to replace\n&gt; ARCWriterProcessor ,Because I want to filter the web pages .\n&gt; thanks\n&gt;\nI&#39;d suggest you first develop your writer standalone using the class \nmain method or better, create a sister JUnit class that exercises your \nnew writer.  Try integrating only after you have it working standalone.\n\nIntegration is not as easy as it could be.  Its kinda awkward putting \nanother writer in place of writer currently -- you have to replace all \nof ARCWriterProcessor.  Would be sweeter if you could just replace \nARCWriter and pick up on the pooling facility of ARCWriterProcessor.  I \nwas thinking of refactoring putting in place a factory that could be \nconfigured with the writer to instantiate.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yahoo!
