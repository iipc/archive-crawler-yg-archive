We have been researching the streamin=\r\ng-media capture problem at the Library of Congress and are eager to make pr=\r\nogress on automated capture.\n\nThere appear to be just a few non-HTTP protoc=\r\nols associated with most streaming media files, mainly RTSP and MMS. It is =\r\neasy to capture those files via RTSP or MMS with commercial software such a=\r\ns GetASF and CoCSoft Stream Down, but integrating the manually captured fil=\r\nes with the archived Web sites is a problem. Having Heritrix get the stream=\r\ning media files along with the Web sites, and integrate it all, would solve=\r\n so much.\n\nAnother challenge is the increasingly common usage of JavaScript=\r\n to dynamically assemble the URL for the destination video or audio file. I=\r\nn looking at the Web site for the Louisiana news channel WAFB (http://www.w=\r\nafb.com/) it&#39;s clear, and frustrating, that we can&#39;t easily capture the pow=\r\nerful video clips on the home page, in part because they are served up with=\r\n dynamically assembled JavaScript links.\n\nIn our crawl of US government Web=\r\n sites, we often encounter RTSP links within the metafiles, so the crawl st=\r\nops there. On a page like \nhttp://epw.senate.gov/epwmultimedia/epwmultimedi=\r\na.htm Heritrix will harvest the RAM file hyperlinked from &quot;July 26, 2005&quot; (=\r\nhttp://epw.senate.gov/epwmultimedia/epw072605.ram) but the RAM file * a 1k =\r\nfile that points to the destination video file * contains this code: rtsp:/=\r\n/video.webcastcenter.com/srs_g2/epw072605.rm. Because of the RTSP protocol,=\r\n the harvest stops there.\n\nThere are issues of redisplay in Wayback too. I =\r\nhope this dialogue continues and grows. We can make slow progress.\n\nMike\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________=\r\n_\n________________________________________________________________________\n=\r\n\nMessage: 1         \n   Date: Thu,  8 Sep 2005 16:20:44 +0200\n   From: nico=\r\nlas.baly@... \nSubject: Heritrix: crawls of stream content\n\nHi!\n\nI&#39;m doi=\r\nng my diploma work at European Archive.\nMy task is to implement a module fo=\r\nr Heritrix crawler in order to crawl and\nstore AV contents (stream objects =\r\nsuch as movies).\n\nI&#39;m new to this project and I&#39;d like to know what was alr=\r\neady done in this.
