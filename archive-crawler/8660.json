It looks\nlike you managed to figure out the tricky parts, and document them,\nbefore I had a chance to do it myself! Thank you for that. At some\npoint I&#39;d like to get some of your insights into the umbra readme.\nAnyone is welcome to accelerate that process by sending a pull\nrequest. :)\n\nAlso want to briefly discuss your results:\nhttps://sbforge.org/display/NAS/Integrating+Umbra+And+Heritrix+3\n&quot;And then we ran some harvest jobs using umbra, on various interesting\nsites including twitter, facebook, youtube, and bt.dk. Running\nharvests takes more time than developing code or learning APIs so this\npart of the investigation was unfortunately cut rather short. In our\nspecific harvests we found very few cases where umbra identified urls\nwhich were not also found by the heritrix extractor. The only ones we\nwere reasonably sure about were some JSON queries in twittter.&quot;\n\nAs you probably know, umbra runs a &quot;behavior&quot; on each web page that it\nloads. These behaviors can be customized for different urls, and they\ncan do things like scroll through the page, click on different\nelements, etc. So far we have only developed a handful of customized\nbehaviors. Of the 4 sites you mentioned, only facebook has a custom\nbehavior in umbra at this point. That does mean that the facebook\npages you harvested should have benefited from umbra. For urls without\nan assigned custom behavior, umbra falls back on a default behavior.\nThe main thing the default behavior does is scroll to the bottom of\nthe page, and keep scrolling if more content is loaded. The twitter\njson queries were probably a result of that scrolling.\nhttps://github.com/internetarchive/umbra/tree/master/umbra/behaviors.d\nPull requests for additional behaviors are also very welcome.\n\nNoah\n\n\nOn Mon, Feb 2, 2015 at 2:57 AM, Colin Rosenthal\ncsr@...

I&#39;ve written a wiki page describing our experiences, including\n&gt; detailed installation and configuration instructions, as well as some\n&gt; rather more limited discussion of the actual results we were able to\n&gt; obtain using Umbra. I hope the page will be a useful resource to anybody\n&gt; else thinking about adding Umbra-integration to their Heritrix 3\n&gt; workflows, and that it might even help to stimulate some Umbra\n&gt; user-community action!\n&gt;\n&gt; https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/Experience+With+IA+Umbra\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me know what you think.\n&gt;\n&gt; Colin Rosenthal\n&gt; IT Developer\n&gt; State and University Library, Aarhus\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; Posted by: Colin Rosenthal &lt;csr@...&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo Groups Links\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
