I&#39;m not sure\nif its\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not up to date with h=\r\neritrix 1.14 or something I changed.

I&#39;m using the mysql\n&gt; &gt; supported JDBC driver thats wrapped in a jar f=\r\nile. Its manual says to\n&gt; &gt; add the path to jar file into CLASSPATH like th=\r\nis:\n&gt; &gt; export set\nCLASSPATH=3D/path/mysql-connector-java-[ver]-bin.jar:$CL=\r\nASSPATH\n&gt; &gt; Since I don&#39;t have admin rights on the system, I&#39;m using the Ja=\r\nva\n&gt; &gt; thats extracted/installed in my home directory. When I run a script =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; use the driver after exporting, it sees the driver and works. When I=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; use it in heritrix, it doesn&#39;t work because the errors get caught by\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; exceptions. \n&gt; &gt; Is it possible that adding it to CLASSPATH doesn&#39;t allo=\r\nw the Java\n&gt; &gt; program (which I set JAVA_HOME to when running Heritrix) to =\r\nsee where\n&gt; &gt; the driver is?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------=\r\n---------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
