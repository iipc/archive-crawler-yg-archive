When I took a look at the frontier report it was placed in\n&gt; queue but I didn&#39;t see it in the crawl.log for a while so figured it\n&gt; had been skipped. It must have just taken a while to get crawled or\n&gt; show up in the log.\n&gt;\n&gt; While on the topic, I&#39;m wondering is there a way to do this type of\n&gt; force feeding of URIs via the Heritrix GUI or profile settings? The\n&gt; method I use for this currently is with a script that greps out URIs\n&gt; in the crawl.log then feeds the matches to the crawler via JMX\n&gt; commands. This does work out okay, but I&#39;m curious if there is maybe\n&gt; another way that is built into Heritrix somewhere (?)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you pause a crawl, towards the base of the index.jsp console page \nappears &#39;View or Edit Frontier URIs&#39;.

So the URIs show up in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; crawl.log as having a -5000 fetch code. However, I have realized\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would actually like to crawl a subset of these URIs that have\n&gt; already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been rejected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I tried to import the URIs back into the frontier with force\n&gt; fetch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; via JMX cmdline but they are not being fetched. I&#39;m assuming\n&gt; this is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because they are &quot;already seen&quot; URIs so the BdbUriUniqFilter is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ignoring them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there a way I can force Heritrx to retry a fetch of the URIs\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; previously had a -5000 code ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As Stack notes, this should work. The &#39;force-fetch&#39; flag means to\n&gt; ignore\n&gt; &gt; the already-included status. However, it doesn&#39;t ignore scoping --\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; you sure the URIs, as added, would be ruled in-scope?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (Are they appearing anywhere after your force-fetch add -- in the\n&gt; &gt; frontier report, in the crawl.log, etc.?)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n\n\n"}}
