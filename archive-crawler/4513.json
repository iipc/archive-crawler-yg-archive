I would like to =\r\nget to\nthe point where I can run Heritrix within the Eclipse environment so=\r\n I\ncan effectively debug code I would like to develop. \n\nI have downloaded =\r\nthe latest heritrix_1.12.1_src\nI have created a new java project in Eclipse=\r\n and completed an import\n(of an existing project) by pointing to the latest=\r\n source download,\nafter manually copying the .project and .classpath files =\r\ninto the\nheritrix_1.12.1 directory.\n\nI have been able to compile the java c=\r\nlasses using maven_1.0.2 by\npointing maven to the maven.xml file.\n\nThat is =\r\nwhere I am at. I am not sure quite what to do next in order to\nget to the p=\r\noint where I can run Heritrix in debug mode to begin to\nget my hands really=\r\n dirty. Initially I would like to investigate\nmaking changes in just Mirror=\r\nWriter, but am interested in possibly\ncreating new filters.\n\nIs there more =\r\nspecific documentation that helps out a more novice\ndeveloper like myself?\n=\r\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\nMike\n\n\n"}}
