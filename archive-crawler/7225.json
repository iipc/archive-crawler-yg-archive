That \ntechnique can&#39;t work today because the scope rule has no way of knowing \nthat the link came from a a[@rel=&#39;nofollow&#39;]/@href, as far as I can see \nafter a quick look. CrawlURI.linkContext would seem to be a logical \nplace for that information, and HTMLLinkContext could be enhanced to \nthat effect.\n\nNoah\n\nOn 07/24/2011 11:38 AM, Tom Zeithaml wrote:\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; Is it possible to skip&lt;a ... rel=nofollow Links ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Maybe a workaround in org.archive.crawler.extractor\n&gt; Class ExtractorHTML is possible ?\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Tom\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
