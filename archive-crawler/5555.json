Please keep the list apprised of your \n&gt; progress of of any code that&#39;s available for integration to the main \n&gt; Heritrix distribution.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n&gt; Juergen Umbrich wrote:\n&gt;   \n&gt;&gt; Hi all\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I wrote a module which detects the &quot;real&quot; media type (mime type) of a \n&gt;&gt; file based on the magic number approach.\n&gt;&gt; At the moment I am comparing the Apache Tika library[1] and the Aduna \n&gt;&gt; Aperture library in terms of detection runtime and mime type coverage.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If there is an interest in the heritrix community for this module I \n&gt;&gt; would like to share or commit the code (but I would need some advices \n&gt;&gt; how to do it).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am also working in a project[3] that tries to predict the media type \n&gt;&gt; of extracted links based on information extracted from URI, link \n&gt;&gt; position and content-type response header field.\n&gt;&gt; At the moment I try to integrate this into heritrix to be able to \n&gt;&gt; perform a kind of document media type focused crawling.\n&gt;&gt; Is there any interest  in the community in these kind of focus crawling?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; best juergen\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; [1] http://incubator.*apache*.org/*tika*/\n&gt;&gt; [2]http://www.aduna-software.com/technologies/aperture/overview.view\n&gt;&gt; [3]http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/4577854/4577855/04577883.pdf\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
