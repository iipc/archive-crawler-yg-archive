I assumed that I could give the path to an=\r\n order file and the list of seeds in this argument, and Heritrix would crea=\r\nte the seeds.txt file for me. But this isn&#39;t the case (at least in CVS HEAD=\r\n). It would appear that in addition to the path to the order you have to ha=\r\nve the seeds file in place so that the reference in the order can find it. =\r\nWhat then is the purpose of the seeds param in the JMX interface?\n\nI notice=\r\nd that you can pass the path to a JAR file containing the order and seed fi=\r\nles. How do I refer to the seeds in the order so that they will be found?\n\n=\r\nI looked around the Wiki for descriptions of these APIs, but didn&#39;t really =\r\nfind anything.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n    -tree\n\nThomas Emerson\nSoftware Arch=\r\nitect\nGerson Lehrman Group\n\n2 Oliver Street, 7th Floor =C2=B7 Boston, MA 02=\r\n109\nTelephone: 617 603 2313 =C2=B7 Fax: 617 603 2305\n\nwww.glgroup.com =C2=\r\n=B7 www.glgcouncils.com\n\nNew York =C2=B7 Austin =C2=B7 Boston =C2=B7 Chicag=\r\no =C2=B7 Los Angeles =C2=B7 San Francisco =C2=B7\nWashington, DC =C2=B7 Lond=\r\non =C2=B7 Hong Kong =C2=B7 Shanghai =C2=B7 Sydney\n\n \nThis e-mail message, a=\r\nnd any attachments, is intended only for the use of the individual or entit=\r\ny identified in the alias address of this message and may contain informati=\r\non that is confidential, privileged and subject to legal restrictions and p=\r\nenalties regarding its unauthorized disclosure and use.
