Tried the following things:\n\n- Entering the SURTs directly in the seed entry box, whether\nseeds-as-surt-prefix is T or F\n- Putting the SURTs in their own file, supplying the name as\nsurts-source-file, but leaving the seeds entry otherwise blank\n\nBased on this experience, I&#39;m now finally starting to understand that\nSURTs are intended for scoping, not seeding, and that the way to use\nSURTs is either:\n\n  1. Enter the seeds as URLs, but use SurtPrefixScope, which will by\ndefault automatically convert your URLs to SURTs internally, and thus\nuse the seeds as their own scope definition.\n\nor\n\n  2. Enter the seeds as URLs, and separately supply a SURT file to use\nas scope limiters.\n\nbut not\n\n  3. Supply only SURTs as seeds.\n\nAccurate?\n\nAndy Boyko   aboy@...\n\n"}}
