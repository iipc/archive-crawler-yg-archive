Other URIs may come in by &#39;transclusion&#39;, if they appear \n&gt; nece=\r\nssary to render other crawled pages, but this won&#39;t bring in all \n&gt; yahoo.c=\r\nom.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you&#39;re using queue-based budgeting or quotas, URIs as discovere=\r\nd from \n&gt; each seed will draw against the same budget/quota. However, it&#39;s =\r\nnot the \n&gt; case that one seed will be crawled until &#39;over quota&#39; with the s=\r\necond \n&gt; seed never reached. Rather, each of the seeds will be tried fairly=\r\n \n&gt; early, then all discovered outlinks from each will be interleaved as \n&gt;=\r\n they are discovered.\n&gt; \n&gt; There might be a slight bias towards paths from =\r\nthe seed listed first, \n&gt; but unless in a contrived situation (tiny quota o=\r\nr giant outlink \n&gt; fan-out, for example if the first seed visited has enoug=\r\nh outlinks to \n&gt; exhaust the entire quota), I doubt this would be noticeabl=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; We haven&#39;t implemented anything which tries to offer balanced-quota=\r\ns \n&gt; between two subsections of the same &#39;site&#39;/hostname. It might be \n&gt; po=\r\nssible to acheive that effect with a novel queue-assignment-policy, \n&gt; that=\r\n uses hostname and one or more of the URI&#39;s path-segments to choose \n&gt; a ta=\r\nrget queue. (This might have deleterious effects on politeness and \n&gt; preqr=\r\nequisite-fetching, though -- more research needed.) I wouldn&#39;t try \n&gt; that =\r\npath unless you were sure, from test crawls, that the usual \n&gt; approach was=\r\nn&#39;t working for you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt; \n&gt; On 5/19/=\r\n10 2:40 PM, dechouxb wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a question about Heri=\r\ntrix 3 behavior : what happens if two seeds have the same authority and the=\r\n quota is based on the group?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Due to the AssignementPolicy (SurtAut=\r\nhorityQueueAssignmentPolicy), the two seeds should be added to the same que=\r\nue.
