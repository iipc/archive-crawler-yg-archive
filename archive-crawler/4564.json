The\nreason why is important too.\nI&#39;m download only sites =\r\nthat ends with .cz, but we are developing a\ndecide rule, that can make a de=\r\ncision whether the page is useful for\nczech archive (based on some country =\r\nsettings, language recognition\nand so on). So the plan is: make a crawl of =\r\nwhole czech domains (380k\n2.level domains) and catch every link that is out=\r\n of scope and than\nmake crawl with the czech decide rule with catched links=\r\n as seeds.\nAnother reasons logging is useful too (deduplicator, quota enfor=\r\ncer,\nregexp,...)\n\nAnd is possible to override logger settings for LinkScope=\r\nr? (count,\nfile location,..)\n\nThanks a lot for answers,\n\nAdam\n\n\n"}}
