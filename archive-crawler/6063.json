The crawler will \n&gt; actually attempt to visit the e=\r\nxact URIs in the seeds file. Then, \n&gt; depending on what outlinks are discov=\r\nered, and what are ruled as \n&gt; in-scope, the crawler may visit other URIs a=\r\ns well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The term &#39;seeds&#39; is widely used for this meaning in other writ=\r\ning about \n&gt; web crawling, as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The term &#39;SURT&#39;, as a special URI =\r\nsyntax useful for describing where a \n&gt; crawler should go, is more specific=\r\n to Heritrix. (Other crawlers have \n&gt; similar ideas under other names.) The=\r\n meaning of &#39;SURT&#39; and \n&gt; &#39;SURT-prefix&#39; is covered in the manual.\n&gt; \n&gt; If y=\r\nou are using scope rules based on SURT prefixes, your scope may load \n&gt; acc=\r\neptable SURTs from a file. The lines in this file are read as either \n&gt; lit=\r\neral SURT-prefixes, or URIs that are converted into &#39;implied \n&gt; SURT-prefix=\r\nes&#39;. Nothing in this file forces the crawler to try visiting \n&gt; a URI. Rath=\r\ner, it just makes visiting some URIs allowable, *if* those \n&gt; URIs are disc=\r\novered by some other path.\n&gt; \n&gt; If starting from the default configuration =\r\nbundled with the crawler, \n&gt; it&#39;s rare to need to use the &#39;surts-source-fil=\r\ne&#39;. First, because that \n&gt; configuration is already set to treat every seed=\r\n as also implying a \n&gt; matching SURT-prefix, to allow the crawl to travel t=\r\no natural/intuitive \n&gt; &#39;extensions&#39; of the seed. And second, because if you=\r\n just need to add a \n&gt; few more SURT-prefixes, you can do so using the shor=\r\ntcut syntax of extra \n&gt; lines in the seeds file.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, this see=\r\nds file:\n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=3D=3Dseeds.txt=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; http://example.com/staff/~examp=\r\nlesen\n&gt; +http://(com,example,\n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; ...is equivalent to the pair of both seeds file and surts-file:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; =3D=3D=3Dseeds.txt=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; http://example.com/staff/~examplesen\n&gt; =3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=3D=3Dsurts.txt=3D=3D=3D=\r\n\n&gt; +http://(com,example,\n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; In both cases, the crawler is only told to explicitly visit the exact \n&gt;=\r\n URI &#39;http://example.com/staff/~examplesen&#39;. However, *if* it discovers \n&gt; =\r\noutlink URIs anywhere in the &#39;example.com&#39; domain, it will follow those \n&gt; =\r\nlinks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope this helps,\n&gt; \n&gt; - Gordon @ IA\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
