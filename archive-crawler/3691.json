Via the web UI, or some \nother way?\n\nSome Scopes use the seeds to configure themselves. Such Scopes are \nsupposed to update their configuration when new seeds are added \nmid-crawl, but it&#39;s possible something about your process is causing \nthis necessary step to be skipped or fail. That might cause the URL \nerrors you&#39;re seeing.\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
