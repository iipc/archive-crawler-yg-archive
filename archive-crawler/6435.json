This may also happen if \na job is ended by terminateCurrentJob and shutdown follows too fast after.\n\nIn the past, we had a lot of jobs with missing reports on our production \nsystem. So we began to delay the shutdown after terminateCurrentJob (up to \nseveral minutes for big jobs) to let Heritrix write the reports to disk.\n\nEven now, reports are not created in some cases, but it&#39;s much less than \nbefore.\n\nBest,\n   Bert\n\n--\nBibliothï¿½que nationale de France\r\n--3593826-7195-1268235055=:6028--\r\n\n"}}
