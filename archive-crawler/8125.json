Any site might be very finicky about User-Agents or \neven use some other form of detection (in-page Javascript) or display \nadaptation (eg: CSS &#39;media queries&#39;). So why your User-Agent might not \nget mobile-specific content on any particular site would require \ncase-by-case analysis.\n\n- Gordon\n\n"}}
