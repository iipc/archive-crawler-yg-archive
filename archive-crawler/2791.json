There is no quick-and-easy=\r\n way to flush the\nfrontier, though. Dropping entries from the frontier base=\r\nd on a regex\nlike &quot;.*&quot; is very time consuming (we have a frontier of 4.5m u=\r\nrls).\n\nIs there a simpler method for carrying the already-seen list between=\r\n\njobs without any other crawl data? Another option would be to extract\nthe =\r\nappropriate bdb from the checkpoint and allow it to be\n(de)serialised indep=\r\nendently.\n\nOur crawls are usually around 5 million urls, with around 6 GB o=\r\nf bdb\nfiles. We want to preserve the already-seen list for as long as\npossi=\r\nble.\n\nThanks\n\nGreg\n\n"}}
