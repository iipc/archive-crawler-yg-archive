But that can just\nadd to the number of things you need to keep track of; even experienced \ncrawl operators at IA often get these backwards.\n\nDecideRules add a little more complexity but are more explicit in their\nintended effects:\n  - they answer ACCEPT, REJECT, or PASS\n  - by chaining them, with some PASSes, they can achieve most of the same\n    results that would require deep nesting of binary filters (with\n    logical combiners like AND/OR)\n  - in chains, the last non-PASS decision &#39;wins&#39;\n  - by convention, pairs of DecideRule implementations are used, instead\n    of a setting that inverts their conditional\n\nAn illustrative example is the difference between URIRegExpFilter, and\nthe pair of DecideRules MatchesRegExpDecideRule and\nNotMatchesRegExpDecideRule.\n\nWith URIRegExpFilter, you can answer only true or false. You need to\nconsider what answer the context requires, and via the &#39;if-match-return&#39;\nsetting, you can control whether a regex match means &#39;true&#39; or &#39;false&#39;.\n\nBut it&#39;s quite likely that the regex is not the final word -- if it\nmatches, the URI is &#39;out&#39;, but if it fails to match, the URI may not\nnecessarily be &#39;in&#39; or &#39;out&#39; -- other rules then kick in. So the \nnon-match answer has to be logically combined with other filter results.\n\nWith the MatchesRegExpDecideRule or NotMatchesRegExpDecideRule, you can\narrange for any of the following four possibilities:\n\nACCEPT if matches, PASS otherwise\nREJECT if matches, PASS otherwise\nACCEPT if not matches, PASS otherwise\nREJECT if not matches, PASS otherwise\n\nThe named return values constrain the usage context to interpret the\nanswer in a certain way -- no &quot;does true mean &#39;include&#39; or &#39;exclude&#39;\nhere?&quot; confusion -- and the PASS lets one rule of a group contribute\nnothing to the final decision, if its condition isn&#39;t met. (No need to \nwrap it in a AND/OR to express operator intent.)\n\n(By prepending such a rule with an all-ACCEPT or all-REJECT rule, you\ncan set a &#39;default&#39; answer for PASS.)\n\nSo that DecideRules can be used anywhere Filters were, there is a \nDecidingFilter class, which lets (chains of) DecideRules be used to \nrender a Filter true/false response. But we generally prefer to use \nDecideRules in new contexts, and if there&#39;s a new CrawlURI-test to be \nimplemented, would like it implemented as a DecideRule rather than a \nFilter. Then it can be used in Filter contexts (via DecidingFilter) and \nDecideRule contexts.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\npandae667 wrote:\n&gt; Hi Michael,\n&gt; \n&gt; I just added 3 tiny contributions to the &quot;Feature Request&quot; tracker I&#39;d\n&gt; like to see in the forthcoming release.
