We\nhave run a simple crawl with 1 million seeds to check how both machines\nperform. Results attached.\n\nPreliminary  findings:\n*CPU* A uses about 75% of its cpu, B about 37% of its cpu\n\n*RAM* A got 2.5GB and B 5GB heap\n\n*Throughput*\nA got 80-140 docs/sec B got 40-70 docs/sec\nA got 12-30 MBit/sec B got 40-55 MBit/sec\n\nWhile we do understand the aprox. 2-1 performance relation, we do not\nunderstand why the performance of machine A shows a steady decline (50%\nover 24h) while machine B it is not a steady decline and only around 10%.\n\nOur first guess would be the difference in RAM available to the BDB\ncache. Can anybody confirm this? Will also an 8 GB machine eventually\nslow down significantly? Does anybody know the reason - is it the\nqueuing of new URIs?\n\nWould be nice if we can discuss this \nBest juergen\n\n\r\n--------------080007040800020605000808\r\nContent-Type: image/png;\n name=&quot;comparison.png&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;comparison.png&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------080007040800020605000808\r\nContent-Type: text/plain;\n name=&quot;global.sheet&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: inline;\n filename=&quot;global.sheet&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n--------------080007040800020605000808--\r\n\n"}}
