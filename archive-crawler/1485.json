A couple other things would need to\nknow about the existence of these longer keys, but not too many things.\n\nI haven&#39;t tested the impact of this kind of key change in berkdb.  Many of\nthe starting points for consideration are here:\nhttp://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/am_misc/tune.html\nhttp://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/am_conf/pagesize.html\n\nI cannot find any use of pagesize in Heritrix, which means that it is\ndefaulting to something that it detects about the underlying IO system\nduring build.  Is this overridden by Java.  We might want to choose a\nlarger pagesize to minimize seeking to new blocks.  What is the current\nHertrix-think on this?\n\n\n&gt; The above combined with your item 3. on last-modified information looks\n&gt; like a nice revisiting algorithm with at least one knob to twiddle --\n&gt; probability threshold -- for influencing general revisit rate.\n\nWe&#39;ve been thinking about this since I mentioned it to you last week.\nThe razor hash that I mentioned appears to not exist.  I might have\nblended things that I had heard about CRM114 and the razor spam reduction\ndatabase.\n\nYou mentioned an Alexa &quot;normalizer&quot; that removed &quot;boring&quot; elements from\ndocuments before comparing them.  That would be a useful catalog to use\nfor reference in building a statistical tool that gets trained to\nrecognize interesting changes.  Is there any information available on the\nAlexa normalizer?\n\n"}}
