Then it would be nice (=essential) if the other PC is allowed\n&gt; to have a different operating system, Java installation etc.\n\nAre you thinking that you would not be able to get to the remote machine \nbecause there is a firewall in the way blocking port 80?  Would you be \nable to get an ssh session into the remote machine in your scenario?\n\n&gt;\n&gt; 2)Running jobs offline with crontab and scripts where the scripts\n&gt; could reside on Heritrix-box or any remote machine\n\nThis&#39;ll be the most common usage I&#39;d imagine.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The idea with filters seems to be that most of them are set before\n&gt; running a job. But I often add filters during crawls when using a set\n&gt; of seeds for the first time. So an easy way to add filters online to\n&gt; any remote controlled job is important!  (think)\n\nOk. I&#39;ll add this to our API list.\n\nThank you for the feedback Kaisa!\n\nSt.Ack\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, stack &lt;stack@a...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve put together notes on remote control of Heritrix on this wiki\n&gt; page:\n&gt; &gt; http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?JmxSurvey (Its linked to\n&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; the original JMX wiki page:\n&gt; &gt; http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?JmxControlStatus). \n&gt; &lt;http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?JmxControlStatus%29.&gt;  I&#39;m\n&gt; &gt; mainly soliciting feedback on what needs to be added to our remote\n&gt; &gt; control facility and when.
