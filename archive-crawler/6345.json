I have adapted the HDFSWriterProcessor with regard to the changes d=\r\none in Heritrix 3. And I also have modified the information written in hado=\r\nop but that&#39;s a side story.\n\nWhen I create a checkpoint, everything &quot;works =\r\nfine&quot; i.e. the buffer(s) -if any- are flushed and the file(s) closed. But w=\r\nhen I terminate the crawl job, I get a java.io.InterruptedIOException insid=\r\ne the DFSClient class (an hadoop class).\n\nMy &quot;educated guess&quot; would be that=\r\n a few toes (threads) are waiting on the outputStream and that they are int=\r\nerupted when the frontier cleans the toes.\n\nIs that something you have alre=\r\nady experienced? How would you fix it? Has anyone tried the original HDFSWr=\r\niterProcessor and experienced the same error?\n\nThanks in advance\n\nBertrand\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
