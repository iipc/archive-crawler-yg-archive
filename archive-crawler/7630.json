In the suggestion, you said that =\r\nthe guy has to create his own BdbUniqFilter to say what to do with the URI.=\r\n I downloaded the Heritrix-Open-Source but I got a bit confused about where=\r\n I have to modify to get this. I parse the files and I got a interesting fi=\r\nle &quot;/crawler/utils/BdbUriUniqFilter.java&quot;, but what I understood, this clas=\r\ns create a hash of alreadyseen URIs but it doesn&#39;t tell anything to the URI=\r\n (if it must be reject or not). Am I correct or I have to edit another file=\r\n? Where can I find the &quot;critical point&quot; in which the information about the =\r\nURI will be written in crawl.log?\n\nThanks a lot the help people. When I get=\r\n the graph I will &#39;post&#39; what I did to help people that have the same diffi=\r\nculty.\n\nAtt.\nElverton.\n\n--- In archive-crawler@yahoogroups.com, Pranay Pand=\r\ney &lt;sspranay@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hi Elverton,\n&gt; \n&gt; Not sure how useful, y=\r\nou may can explore the option of using the WAT utility that IA offers to pu=\r\nll some of the metadata relevant to your task.\n&gt; \n&gt; https://webarchive.jira=\r\n.com/wiki/display/Iresearch/Web+Archive+Transformation+%28WAT%29+Specificat=\r\nion%2C+Utilities%2C+and+Usage+Overview\n&gt; \n&gt; -Pranay\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________=\r\n____________________\n&gt;  From: Elverton &lt;uelverton@...&gt;\n&gt; To: archive-crawle=\r\nr@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, February 28, 2012 6:17 PM\n&gt; Subject: [a=\r\nrchive-crawler] Re: How can I create a complete graph in Heritrix?\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0 \n&gt; Hello everyone again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m sorry to bother but I&#39;m out of wa=\r\nys. I read a lot of things about WARC in the group and there was a topic th=\r\nat has just what I want but it didn&#39;t get how to do it. The topic is (http:=\r\n//tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/message/4099) but I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw how to handle with them. So, my problems are:\n&gt; \n&gt; =3D&gt; 1: How can I hand=\r\nle with WARCFiles? What&#39;s the pattern? Where can I have more information ab=\r\nout it? \n&gt; \n&gt; =3D&gt; 2: I perceive that ARCFiles, like below, has a pattern b=\r\nut I have to be sure about it. Is WARC-Target-URI the URI downloaded? I not=\r\nice that http://www.cfpn.mar.mil.br/ has more links that we have in outlink=\r\n.
