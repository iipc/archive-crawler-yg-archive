Until that&#39;s fixed,\nI&#39;d recommend allowing &#39;text/plain&#39; downloads to proceed so that robots\nrules are not inadvettently circumvented.\n\n(Occasionally robots.txt has odd MIME types, too, but I think accepting\ntext/html and text/plain would handle most cases.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nrobeger wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed in a crawl log that when I have Tom&#39;s text/html midfetch\n&gt; filter set up that robots.txt triggers it (which makes sense as it&#39;s a\n&gt; text/plain), but I&#39;m guessing that heritrix has already processed the\n&gt; file for what it needs rules-wise, correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; Just wanted to make sure that it wasn&#39;t somehow circumventing\n&gt; robots.txt and I&#39;d end up crawling sites that didn&#39;t want to be crawled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Rob.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
