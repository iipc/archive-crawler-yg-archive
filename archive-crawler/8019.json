Again, from the\n&gt; documentation, it seemed to me that this should only happen if\n&gt; alsoCheckVia was true, in which case URLs directly referenced would be\n&gt; from a URL prefixed with a seed would also be crawled.\n&gt;\n&gt; Have I misuderstood?\n&gt;\n&gt; I am running heritrix 3.1.1.\n\nAny of the rules that appear after the early SurtPrefixedDecideRule \ncould also set the scoping decision to ACCEPT.\n\nThe main other reason such extra ACCEPTs are done, in our default case \nfor usual archival collection, is *transclusion*. That is, another URI \nis referred to in a way that makes the crawler believe this other URI is \n(or is likely) needed to accurately redisplay the page later.\n\nMost commonly, this is as the SRC attribute of an IMG, IFRAME, SCRIPT, \nor LINK element (but also includes URIs inferred from inside Javascript, \nwhere it is hard to tell if they are used for in-page updates or as \nseparate navigation targets).\n\nIf you don&#39;t need to fetch such resources, you can discard the \nTransclusionDecideRule, or (equivalently) set its various \nhops-to-respect-such-inclusion settings to &#39;0&#39;.\n\nThis is also addresses somewhat at:\n\nhttps://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/unexpected+offsite+content\n\n- Gordon\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;bean id=&quot;acceptSurts&quot; class=&quot;org.archive.modules.deciderules.surt.SurtPrefixedDecideRule&quot;&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;!-- &lt;property name=&quot;decision&quot; value=&quot;ACCEPT&quot;/&gt; --&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;seedsAsSurtPrefixes&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;property name=&quot;alsoCheckVia&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;!-- &lt;property name=&quot;surtsSourceFile&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt; --&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;!-- &lt;property name=&quot;surtsDumpFile&quot; value=&quot;${launchId}/surts.dump&quot; /&gt; --&gt;\n&gt;    &lt;!-- &lt;property name=&quot;surtsSource&quot;&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;bean class=&quot;org.archive.spring.ConfigString&quot;&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;property name=&quot;value&quot;&gt;\n&gt;            &lt;value&gt;\n&gt;             # example.com\n&gt;             # http://www.example.edu/path1/\n&gt;             # +http://(org,example,\n&gt;            &lt;/value&gt;\n&gt;           &lt;/property&gt;\n&gt;          &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;         &lt;/property&gt; --&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;/bean&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
