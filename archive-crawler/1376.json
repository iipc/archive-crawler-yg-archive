The main problem will be that CandidateURI&#39;s have no AList (I\n&gt; wish they did!)  But thanks much -- this is an elegant solution.\n&gt; I&#39;ll let you know if I have any problems with this.

Makes sense.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Heritrix, I can see where attributes could be copied into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; child URIs -- in the handleLinkCollection method of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Postselector class, for example, when the CandidateURI is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; formed.  So I would like to extend Postselector and over-ride\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just this one method, but it is private.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you all decide which methods to make protected and which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; private?  Maybe it would be nice to allow the application\n&gt; &gt; &gt; programmer to add attributes to the CandidateURI before it goes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; onto the frontier, perhaps by some call-back or by factoring\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out a protected and over-ridable method that decorates the\nCandidateURI.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I made the Postselector#schedule method protected so you can\n&gt; &gt; override it in HEAD.  Is this sufficent?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
