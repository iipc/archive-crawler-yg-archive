However, such corruption could also be triggered by a \nmomentary bit of memory or disk/IO corruption, so checking that the \nsystem is healthy is also appropriate. (Checking system logs, filesystem \nintegrity, or using disk diagnostics like &#39;SMART&#39; may be helpful.)\n\n- Gordon @ IA\n\nt.schoellhorn wrote:\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; \n&gt; currently I am running a crawl with 500 seeds. After some hours the an error occurs repeatedely in the job.log. It occurs that often, so that the job.log gets 500 MB big - so I assume that something is seriously wrong here (see attachted job.log excerpt). \n&gt; \n&gt; As I honestly have no idea what is going on I try to attach my crawler-beans.xml so that someone might get an idea what I am doing wrong or what is going on.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;d be glad for any suggestions what I can try to solve that problem. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cheers,\n&gt; Tino\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; == BEGIN job.log\n&gt; 2010-02-04T11:17:41.692Z SEVERE Trying get #4 in queue com,volvocars,www, with 4329 items using key com,volvocars,www, (in thread &#39;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier@...&#39;)\n&gt; 2010-02-04T11:17:41.693Z SEVERE peekItem failure; retrying (in thread &#39;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier@...&#39;)\n&gt; 2010-02-04T11:17:41.694Z SEVERE no item where expected in queue com,volvocars,www, (in thread &#39;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier@...&#39;)\n&gt; 2010-02-04T11:17:41.694Z SEVERE No CrawlURI from ready non-empty queue com,volvocars,www,\n&gt; queue precedence currentSize totalEnqueues sessionBalance lastCost (averageCost) lastDequeueTime wakeTime totalSpend/totalBudget errorCount lastPeekUri lastQueuedUri\n&gt; com,volvocars,www, 1 4329 15273 2500 0(0) 2010-02-04T10:53:11.603Z - 500/-1 5 http://www.volvocars.com/kz/models/xc90/gallery/Pages/default.aspx http://www.volvocars.com/tr/top/about/news-events/Pages/default.aspx\n&gt; \n&gt;  (in thread &#39;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier@...&#39;)\n&gt; 2010-02-04T11:17:41.695Z SEVERE peekItem failure; retrying (in thread &#39;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier@...&#39;)\n&gt; 2010-02-04T11:17:41.695Z SEVERE Trying get #2 in queue com,volvocars,www, with 4329 items using key com,volvocars,www, (in thread &#39;org.archive.crawler.frontier.BdbFrontier@...&#39;)\n&gt; ==== END job.log\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
