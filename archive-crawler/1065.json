All seems to be working fine but \nkeep an eye out for unexpected behaviors.\n\nAnsi Zhousp: I ran a crawl over the weekend using the order file you \npassed me a while back, the one that was generating KeyQueue naming \nerrors.  It looks like we&#39;ve cleaned up the crawl-terminating issues.  \nI&#39;d be interested if its working for you.\n\nTom Emerson: The interesting spin on the KeyQueue issue you found has \nalso been addressed in HEAD.  Let us know if you find more instances.\n\nYours,\nSt.Ack\n\n\n\n"}}
